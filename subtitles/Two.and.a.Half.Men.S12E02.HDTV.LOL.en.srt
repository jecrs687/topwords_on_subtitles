00:00:03,024 --> 00:00:03,921
I'm dead.

3
00:00:03,922 --> 00:00:06,350
You're in the hospital.
You had a mild heart attack.

4
00:00:06,351 --> 00:00:07,450
I almost died, Alan.

5
00:00:07,452 --> 00:00:09,152
But the important thing is
you didn't.

6
00:00:09,154 --> 00:00:11,721
Other than you guys and my mom,
I got nobody.

7
00:00:11,723 --> 00:00:13,122
At least you
got Jake.

8
00:00:13,124 --> 00:00:14,490
I want to have a kid of my own.

9
00:00:14,492 --> 00:00:17,694
You are obviously more than qualified.
Thank you.

10
00:00:17,696 --> 00:00:19,062
I'd start looking
at golden retriever puppies,

11
00:00:19,064 --> 00:00:20,563
'cause there's no way
you're getting a baby.

12
00:00:20,565 --> 00:00:22,365
You're a single guy,
and the system

13
00:00:22,367 --> 00:00:23,833
is really geared
towards married couples.

14
00:00:23,835 --> 00:00:26,369
Alan Harper,
will you marry me?

16

Wait. You seriously
want to marry me?

17

Yes.

18
00:00:34,312 --> 00:00:36,346
Alan Jerome Harper,

19
00:00:36,348 --> 00:00:38,948
would you be my wi...?

20

22
00:00:43,588 --> 00:00:45,688
Okay, I'm a little confused.

23
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,859
And not like the time I-I got
that massage from that lady-boy.

24
00:00:51,429 --> 00:00:53,429
Look, I want
to adopt a kid,

25
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:56,566
and the quickest way for me
to do that is to get married.

26
00:00:56,568 --> 00:00:58,768
And if I'm gonna
settle for someone,

27
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,503
it might as well be you.

28
00:01:00,505 --> 00:01:03,339
That's exactly what
my first wife said.

29
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:06,109
Listen, I-I know
this sounds crazy,

30
00:01:06,111 --> 00:01:09,579
but you would be doing me
the biggest favor of my life.

31
00:01:09,581 --> 00:01:11,080
Walden, there are
literally millions of women

32
00:01:11,082 --> 00:01:13,283
who would marry you
at the drop of a hat.

33
00:01:13,285 --> 00:01:14,884
Yeah, but I wouldn't be
half as happy

34
00:01:14,886 --> 00:01:16,920
with any of them
as I would be with you.

35
00:01:16,922 --> 00:01:18,821
Go on.

36
00:01:21,293 --> 00:01:24,460
When-when I think of
the ten things I want in a wife,

37
00:01:24,462 --> 00:01:26,229
you have nine of them.

38
00:01:26,231 --> 00:01:28,464
You're my best friend,
you're trustworthy,

39
00:01:28,466 --> 00:01:31,734
you're loving, you're smart,
you'll never leave me.

40
00:01:31,736 --> 00:01:34,437
Married or not, till
death do us part.

41
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,606
You're funny,
you're understanding.

42
00:01:36,608 --> 00:01:39,142
You don't care
if I leave the toilet seat up.

43
00:01:39,144 --> 00:01:40,877
I actually prefer it.

44
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:43,079
Although, the other night,
I forgot it was up,

45
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:44,814
and I had a surprise
splash-down.

46
00:01:45,917 --> 00:01:49,619
I was like a
turtle on its back.

47
00:01:49,621 --> 00:01:50,787
Right there. That's another one.

48
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:51,955
As long as you're around,

49
00:01:51,957 --> 00:01:54,624
I will never be the most
awkward guy in the room.

50
00:01:54,626 --> 00:01:56,292
So, what's the one thing

51
00:01:56,294 --> 00:01:59,262
you want in a wife
that I don't have?

52
00:01:59,264 --> 00:02:01,064
Oh. Right, right.

53
00:02:01,066 --> 00:02:03,967
I-I do not have
one of those.

54
00:02:03,969 --> 00:02:05,868
I barely have one of these.

55
00:02:08,606 --> 00:02:10,606
I mean, how would
this work exactly?

56
00:02:10,608 --> 00:02:13,242
I mean, we're gonna
pretend to be a couple?

57
00:02:13,244 --> 00:02:14,877
We wouldn't pretend.

58
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,880
We're actually going
to be a same-sex married couple.

59
00:02:17,882 --> 00:02:21,617
And like most married couples,
we will not have sex.

60
00:02:22,487 --> 00:02:25,121
Not even on my birthday?

61
00:02:25,123 --> 00:02:28,891
Sorry, sorry... flashback
to the first wife.

62
00:02:28,893 --> 00:02:31,160
So, so, I can have
crazy, anonymous sex

63
00:02:31,162 --> 00:02:33,096
with any woman I want?

64
00:02:33,098 --> 00:02:36,366
No. You will still be you.

65
00:02:36,368 --> 00:02:38,935
Oh.

66
00:02:40,638 --> 00:02:43,339
Mr. Alan Harper-Schmidt.

67
00:02:44,776 --> 00:02:46,876
Dr. Alan Schmidt.

68
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:48,177
What are you doing?

69
00:02:48,179 --> 00:02:51,347
Oh, just trying
to see what sounds best.

70
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:53,149
Yes, Mr. and Mr. Harper-Schmidt,

71
00:02:53,151 --> 00:02:54,784
welcome back

72
00:02:54,786 --> 00:02:56,753

73
00:02:56,755 --> 00:02:58,855
Okay, cut the Schmidt.

74
00:02:58,857 --> 00:03:01,424
Oh, yeah, I'd have
to put up with that Schmidt.

75
00:03:01,426 --> 00:03:03,459
But you know what?
I'm gonna own it.

76
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:05,028
I don't give a Schmidt.

77

What are you saying?

78
00:03:07,499 --> 00:03:10,199

Ow! What was
that for?

117
00:04:52,591 --> 00:04:54,358
For marrying Zippy.

118
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,026
Hey! Why are you
hitting me?!

119
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:58,495
For being Zippy.

120
00:04:58,497 --> 00:05:00,330
This sounds great,
except for one thing.

121
00:05:00,332 --> 00:05:01,665
You guys aren't gay.

122
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:03,300
No, we're not gay.

123
00:05:03,302 --> 00:05:05,168
We are getting
married because...

124
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,571
It'll make it easier
for him to adopt a child!

125

You want a child?

129
00:05:13,512 --> 00:05:15,512
Yes. I've been doing
a lot of thinking

130
00:05:15,514 --> 00:05:17,714
about my life,
and I believe

131
00:05:17,716 --> 00:05:20,317
that having a kid would
add more meaning to it.

132
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:22,619
Parenthood can be
very rewarding.

133
00:05:22,621 --> 00:05:24,821
Some of the time.

134
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:28,425
So, this marriage
is just a sham?

135
00:05:28,427 --> 00:05:30,861
I didn't march in all
of those gay rights parades

136
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:34,331
so you guys could make a mockery
of our hard-won civil liberties.

137
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,532
You marched in
those parades

138
00:05:35,534 --> 00:05:37,567
so you could get drunk
and pick up chicks.

139
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:41,004
Hard-won chicks.

140
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:43,407
All right, look, we're not
making a mockery of anything,

141
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:46,043
and I get the challenges
that gay couples face,

142
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:49,079
but I-I also know that there
are a lot of kids out there

143
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:51,114
that are just looking
for a good home,

144
00:05:51,116 --> 00:05:53,150
and I think we
can provide that.

145
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:55,118
And I get health insurance.

146
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,354
You guys are lucky
you're in California.

147
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:00,123
In some states, they still don't
let gay couples get married

148
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,425
or adopt kids.

I was in Utah,

150
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:06,596
I vomited on a police officer,
and I was arrested.

151
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:10,100
Simply for being gay.

152
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:13,804

175
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:22,606
Ca-kaw! Ca-kaw!

176
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:26,009
And where do you see this
happening?

177
00:07:26,011 --> 00:07:29,479
Well, obviously,
there's Hawaii and Cabo.

178
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:30,914
Um,

179
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,816
I'd be happy
with either one of those.

180
00:07:32,818 --> 00:07:35,786
Um, but I hear that Greece is
fabulous this time of year.

181
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,321
And just FYI, Mykonos is very
friendly to same-sex couples.

182
00:07:38,323 --> 00:07:40,023
<i>Opa!</i>

183
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:43,693
Nopa!

184
00:07:43,695 --> 00:07:45,529
We're getting married
in the courthouse.

185
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:48,498
Please tell me “the courthouse"
is a chic bar in Ibiza.

186
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,400
No, it's a rundown courthouse

187
00:07:50,402 --> 00:07:52,469
around the corner
from the Jiffy Lube.

188
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:53,737
We'll pay 50 bucks,

189
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:55,305
we'll do some paperwork,

190
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:57,107
and if you're good,
we'll go outside

191
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:59,576
to the food truck,
and I'll buy you a gyro.

192
00:07:59,578 --> 00:08:02,112
Opa!

193
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,780
Oh.

194
00:08:03,782 --> 00:08:05,949
Okay. I see.

195
00:08:05,951 --> 00:08:07,918
What's wrong?

196
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,020
Nothing.

197
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:12,022
Talk to me.

198
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:13,657
No, it's fine.

199
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,725
You know, I just
wanted to make sure

200
00:08:15,727 --> 00:08:17,494
this whole thing
was special for us,

201
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:19,763
for you, but, you know,
it's no big deal.

202
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:22,232
I'm sure we can
still make it special.

203
00:08:22,234 --> 00:08:24,301
Maybe, uh... maybe Jenny
can take some pictures

204
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,336
on her iPhone.

205
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:28,572
Alan, come on.

206
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,774
Don't touch me.

207
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:35,712
Look, this isn't about us.

208
00:08:35,714 --> 00:08:37,981
It's about bringing
a kid into our lives.

209
00:08:37,983 --> 00:08:40,250
It's a simple
business transaction,

210
00:08:40,252 --> 00:08:42,953
like paying an electric bill,
or buying dinner, or...

211
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:44,888
writing a rent check.

212
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,425
Stop me when I land on something
you've actually done.

213
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:49,759
I just got excited

214
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:51,461
because I've never had the
wedding I always dreamed of.

215
00:08:51,463 --> 00:08:55,999
Right, the wedding
that every little boy dreams of.

216
00:08:56,001 --> 00:09:00,737
You know, we still need
to get each other rings.

217
00:09:00,739 --> 00:09:02,906
We can just get something
online.

218
00:09:02,908 --> 00:09:06,543
Or we could go into
Beverly Hills and have brunch,

219
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:08,612
and go ring shopping together.

220
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:10,981
Really?

221
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:12,549
Sure.

222
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:15,318

00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:45,448
Oh, uh, and I've got some

233
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,018
Guess it's true. Married couples
do start to think alike.

Maybe soon, we'll start to
look alike, he said hopefully.

Uh, just this.

245
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,546
Oh. What's that?

246
00:10:16,548 --> 00:10:19,149
Oh, it's a simple dissolution
of services agreement.

247
00:10:20,285 --> 00:10:23,753
Oh! Oh, you-you mean,
like a... like a prenup?

248
00:10:23,755 --> 00:10:26,056
Yup. So, it's not a big deal.

249
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:29,759
Just go ahead and sign it,
he said hopefully.

250
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:32,028
Why do we need a prenup?

251

And here we go.

252
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:34,864
Uh...

253
00:10:34,866 --> 00:10:36,733
when couples get married,

254
00:10:36,735 --> 00:10:38,602
finances become complicated,

255
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:40,904
and this just simplifies it.

256
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:42,272
Oh, does it?

257
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:44,341
'Cause it seems like
it's pretty simple right now.

258
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:45,542
You don't trust me.

259
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:47,277
Okay, that's not true at all.

260
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,478
Isn't it?

261
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,914
I mean, is this what
you really think of me?

262
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,850
That I'm some kind
of gold digger?

263
00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:57,387
Okay, yes, I have lived here
four years rent-free.

264
00:10:57,389 --> 00:10:59,756
Look, why do you have
to make this difficult?

265
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:02,192
You know, why do you make
everything so difficult?

266
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,594
It's like yesterday at brunch,
when you sent back the champagne

267
00:11:04,596 --> 00:11:08,465
because the bubbles didn't taste
like “a mouthful of stars”"

268
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:11,334
If it doesn't explode in
your mouth, what's the point?

269
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:15,238
You said that to the waiter,
too, and it was troubling then!

270
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,907
Look, I'm just trying
to protect my assets.

271
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:20,744
Oh-oh, yeah? Well, then maybe
I should protect my assets.

272
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:23,013
You know, don't worry, I'm pretty sure
that your VHS copy

273
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,148
of<i> Dirty Dancing</i>
and your complete collection

274
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,884
of<i> Ghostbusters</i> trading cards
are safe.

275
00:11:27,886 --> 00:11:31,588
I am a collector
of '80s movie memorabilia.

276
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,325
And hobby mocking is not
an attractive color on you.

277
00:11:36,261 --> 00:11:38,094
Hobby mocker.

278
00:11:38,096 --> 00:11:41,231
I also have one other asset
that you cannot have,

279
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,699
my dignity.

280
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:43,933
Your dignity?!
Mm-hmm.

281
00:11:43,935 --> 00:11:45,535
Your dignity...?
Yes.

282
00:11:45,537 --> 00:11:47,504
Really? 'Cause I'm pretty sure
that the security guard

283
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,539

to remove the bench

I got to tell you, I'm having a lot of
second thoughts right now.

287
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,750

where I want to be in my life,

Now sign the prenup!

but that doesn't mean you get

to shove whatever you want
down my throat

292

00:13:16,973 --> 00:13:20,341
When Marty and I married, the
only thing I was willing to sign

315
00:13:20,343 --> 00:13:23,611
was his “do not resuscitate”

316
00:13:23,613 --> 00:13:26,614

Darling, it is
just business.

320
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,824
He's using you
to get what he wants,

321
00:13:36,826 --> 00:13:39,727
and you should be using him
to get what you want:

322
00:13:39,729 --> 00:13:41,663
financial security.

323
00:13:41,665 --> 00:13:43,398
I'm not doing it for
financial security.

324
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,033
Walden genuinely
wants a child,

325
00:13:45,035 --> 00:13:48,069
the same way that I wanted
Jake and-and you wanted...

326
00:13:48,071 --> 00:13:50,038
Charlie.

327
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,873
I just thought that
after four years together

328
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,541
that he would trust me
when it comes to money.

329
00:13:53,543 --> 00:13:57,378
Oh, darling, after 47 years,
I don't trust you.

330
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,348
Maybe, uh, a-a
prenup is justified.

331
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,050
Maybe I am just a sponge.

332
00:14:02,052 --> 00:14:04,185
A-a-a parasite.

333
00:14:04,187 --> 00:14:08,623
And-and he tolerates me
because he's my best friend.

334
00:14:09,426 --> 00:14:10,491
And I've let him down,

335
00:14:10,493 --> 00:14:13,294
and all I want to
do is make him happy.

336
00:14:13,296 --> 00:14:15,330
“Best friend.”

337
00:14:15,332 --> 00:14:17,031
“Happy.”

338
00:14:17,033 --> 00:14:19,734
I just have no idea where
you got these warped views

339
00:14:19,736 --> 00:14:21,269

340
00:14:21,271 --> 00:14:22,770
He wouldn't sign a prenup?

341
00:14:22,772 --> 00:14:26,074
No, he got all upset
and he threw a hissy fit.

342
00:14:26,076 --> 00:14:28,543
“You don't trust me.
The wedding's off.

343
00:14:28,545 --> 00:14:32,080
I'm going to
Ibiza by myself”"

344
00:14:32,082 --> 00:14:34,315
Let's face it, the man
is simply not your equal.

345
00:14:34,317 --> 00:14:36,617

in the mountains, Alan would be
the first person eaten.

347
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,023
On the other hand,

348
00:14:42,025 --> 00:14:43,825
you're handsome,
successful, smart.

349
00:14:43,827 --> 00:14:46,127
You would be eaten last.

350
00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:49,831
You're just saying I'd be eaten
last 'cause you're my mom.

351
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,767
Well, listen, I know you're
serious about this child thing,

352
00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:55,932
so I mentioned your situation
to a very cute intern at work.

353
00:14:55,933 --> 00:14:56,997
You didn't.

354
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,550
Oh, Jessica's very amenable
to striking a business deal.

355
00:14:59,642 --> 00:15:00,975
Plus,

356
00:15:00,977 --> 00:15:03,211
she's already visited
Dr. Schenkman,

357
00:15:03,213 --> 00:15:04,579
if you know what I mean.

358
00:15:04,581 --> 00:15:07,548
Mom, that's exactly
what I don't want.

359
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,283
I don't even
know this Jess...

360
00:15:09,285 --> 00:15:11,986
Holy Schenkman.

361
00:15:11,988 --> 00:15:14,122
Look, I-I w...

362
00:15:17,994 --> 00:15:21,462
No, she'd be eaten first.

363
00:15:21,464 --> 00:15:24,565
Look, no, I want
someone that I can trust.

364
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:27,001
That's why I picked Alan
in the first place.

365
00:15:27,003 --> 00:15:29,003
How can you possibly trust him?

366
00:15:29,005 --> 00:15:31,139
He siphons gas out of your car.

367
00:15:31,141 --> 00:15:32,507
Technically, I never caught him.

368
00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:33,841
I just assumed that he did it

369
00:15:33,843 --> 00:15:35,510
'cause the garden hose smelled
like gas

370
00:15:35,512 --> 00:15:37,245
and one time he burped
near a candle

371
00:15:37,247 --> 00:15:39,414
and it lit the couch on fire.

372
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:42,417
I don't know why you ever
let Alan live with you in the first place.

373
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:44,352
Uh, for starters,
he saved my life.

374
00:15:44,354 --> 00:15:47,021
And... he's been
there for me,

375
00:15:47,023 --> 00:15:51,659
every time that I needed him
and even times when I didn't.

376
00:15:51,661 --> 00:15:54,095
The bottom line is...

377
00:15:54,097 --> 00:15:56,097
he's my best friend.

378
00:15:56,099 --> 00:15:57,231

your best friend.

379
00:15:57,233 --> 00:15:59,400

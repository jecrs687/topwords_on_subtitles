1
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,150
- What the hell's going on?
- We need to see Mia about a murder.

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,335
- Do you know Jason Williams?
- My brother's son.

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:17,026
- He and his brother are good lads.
- Is Mia close to them?

4
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,350
She's with them often enough.

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,250
Connor!

6
00:00:24,175 --> 00:00:25,175
No!

7
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:26,425
(SCREAMS)

8
00:01:40,275 --> 00:01:44,275
Here's a list of what was
removed from Mia Owen's house.

9
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,485
- Has the laptop gone to CCU?
- They're working on it.

10
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:48,525
Great.

11
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:55,175
I hope we find something on
it to link her to Geraint Elis.

12
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:59,125
I'll tell her. Thanks.

13
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,425
That was PC Davies.

14
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:06,175
They think they found the weapon
that killed Sion in Lee's house.

15
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,550
A screwdriver.

16
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,200
It's all there.

17
00:02:13,475 --> 00:02:18,225
The older brother has a record,
nothing serious. Minor dealing.

18
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,350
(PHONE)

19
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,350
DCI John.

20
00:02:26,425 --> 00:02:27,425
When?

21
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,050
They're treating him now?

22
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,250
Connor Pritchard.

23
00:02:34,025 --> 00:02:36,150
OK, thanks. I'll go there now.

24
00:02:40,075 --> 00:02:41,225
Mia's friend.

25
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:44,125
He tried to kill himself in the lake.

26
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,475
He's in intensive care.
His mother's there.

27
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:52,350
Find out more about him. Do you
have the headteacher's number?

28
00:02:52,475 --> 00:02:54,025
I'll phone her.

29
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,475
She won't thank me.

30
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,600
- If you hear any news about Mia...
- Go. I'll phone your mobile.

31
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,575
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

32
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:01,575
Hello?

33
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,375
Mia.

34
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,480
- Are you OK? Anyone with you?
- No.

35
00:04:11,525 --> 00:04:13,525
Has something happened?

36
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,250
You're freezing. Come in.

37
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,275
Mrs Pritchard?

38
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,600
DCI John. Can I have a word?

39
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,075
I was sorry to hear about your son.

40
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:27,200
They think the cold saved him.

41
00:05:30,075 --> 00:05:32,350
Shock shuts down the body.

42
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,350
I thought things were improving,
that he was coming back to me.

43
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,600
What was going through his mind?

44
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,400
What's been going on?

45
00:05:46,575 --> 00:05:51,150
He seemed to carry the weight
of the world on his shoulders.

46
00:05:51,275 --> 00:05:56,050
I put it down to the pressure
of fitting in at the new school.

47
00:05:56,475 --> 00:06:01,125
He made friends. It looked as
if things were getting better.

48
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:04,550
Were Mia Owen and Lee
Williams those friends?

49
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,250
Yes.

50
00:06:08,225 --> 00:06:12,300
- How long have they known each other?
- About a year.

51
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,350
What's wrong?

52
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:19,275
A body was discovered today
on the outskirts of Blaenau.

53
00:06:19,525 --> 00:06:24,200
Witnesses saw a boy and girl
who resembled Mia and Lee there.

54
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,250
It's early days yet.

55
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,425
We need to talk to Lee and Mia...

56
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,225
and Connor.

57
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:37,450
What has this got to do with Connor?

58
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:42,000
We believe there's a link...

59
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:46,275
between this murder and
Geraint Elis's murder.

60
00:06:46,425 --> 00:06:50,200
Whoever phoned the
police about the body...

61
00:06:50,325 --> 00:06:53,325
felt very guilty.

62
00:06:54,175 --> 00:06:56,175
I think it was your son.

63
00:06:58,325 --> 00:07:00,350
No, my son...

64
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,450
would never...

65
00:07:05,075 --> 00:07:07,325
He'll tell us, I promise.

66
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,325
He'll tell us when he wakes.

67
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,600
(TEXT)

68
00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:16,075
Sorry.

69
00:07:21,225 --> 00:07:23,050
Sorry, I have to go.

70
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,375
I'll send another officer
to talk to you. Thanks.

71
00:07:34,075 --> 00:07:36,075
What happened, Mia?

72
00:07:39,575 --> 00:07:42,200
Has someone hurt you?

73
00:07:47,575 --> 00:07:50,000
This is a weird place to live.

74
00:07:51,525 --> 00:07:54,225
You said your door was always open.

75
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,475
It is, of course it is.

76
00:07:57,425 --> 00:08:01,575
No offence, but hiding
here isn't much use.

77
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,250
What happened, Mia?

78
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,175
You always worried about us.

79
00:08:18,225 --> 00:08:20,600
You said we could tell you anything.

80
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,575
We all need someone to talk to...

81
00:08:26,475 --> 00:08:30,375
someone who'll listen and won't judge.

82
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,200
What if I said I'd killed someone?

83
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,325
That I'd killed someone
and watched him die.

84
00:08:50,025 --> 00:08:52,025
You'd judge me then.

85
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,300
What have you done, Mia?

86
00:09:02,225 --> 00:09:04,225
I should've spoken to you.

87
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,600
Of course.

88
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,175
I'm sorry if you feel I let you down.

89
00:09:16,475 --> 00:09:18,350
You didn't let me down.

90
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,100
You did exactly what
I expected you to do...

91
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,550
you interfered.

92
00:09:26,225 --> 00:09:28,225
I'm not sure I understand.

93
00:09:29,325 --> 00:09:30,325
Gwilym.

94
00:09:31,525 --> 00:09:34,025
You couldn't stop yourself.

95
00:09:37,425 --> 00:09:39,175
That's unfair, Mia.

96
00:09:39,425 --> 00:09:43,100
You interfered and ran away. I saw you.

97
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,350
Stirring things up
made you feel important.

98
00:09:46,475 --> 00:09:50,706
- I was trying to help Gwilym.
- It made you feel like a hero.

99
00:09:51,225 --> 00:09:55,100
I tried to help him because
I was worried about him.

100
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,425
No-one really worries.

101
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,175
That isn't true.

102
00:10:01,175 --> 00:10:02,475
No?

103
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,525
Sorry if that's what you think, Mia.

104
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:09,200
But...

105
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,075
you're wrong.

106
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,100
Are you hungry?

107
00:10:28,525 --> 00:10:30,275
I'll make toast.

108
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:33,325
Drink the tea. I won't be long.

109
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,025
How's Connor?

110
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,400
Not great.

111
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Look.

112
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,450
What do you think?

113
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,550
It's as if nothing has happened.

114
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,125
(PHONE)

115
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,550
DCI John.

116
00:11:17,175 --> 00:11:18,550
It's James Rhys.

117
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,050
What's wrong?

118
00:11:21,175 --> 00:11:23,025
Mia Owen's here.

119
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,150
Now?

120
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,075
She turned up, knocked the door.

121
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,350
Something has happened.

122
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,050
OK, Mr Rhys. Keep her talking.

123
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:37,225
Be careful. We're on the
way. She's with James Rhys.

124
00:11:37,475 --> 00:11:39,100
Let's go.

125
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:50,225
What do you want on your toast?

126
00:11:53,075 --> 00:11:54,075
Mia?

127
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,350
Mia?

128
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,450
Mia!

129
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,200
Mia!

130
00:13:02,225 --> 00:13:05,175
- Where's the dog section?
- They'll be here any minute.

131
00:13:05,425 --> 00:13:08,575
- We'll need a helicopter.
- DSI Lynn has sorted it.

132
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,025
Thanks.

133
00:13:11,275 --> 00:13:14,050
- Mr Rhys.
- Why is it taking so long?

134
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,399
- You should be looking for her.
- We need everything in place.

135
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:21,250
- It takes time.
- She could be anywhere by now.

136
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:24,375
That's why we need to be organized.

137
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,350
You can help Mia by talking to me.

138
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,275
Why did she come to you?

139
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:38,450
Did she threaten you?

140
00:13:39,075 --> 00:13:41,475
Do you know why we're looking for her?

141
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,600
Yes.

142
00:13:48,175 --> 00:13:52,075
She decided Gwilym's
suicide was my fault.

143
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,300
That made me angry.

144
00:13:55,475 --> 00:13:56,475
God.

145
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,075
She came here and I fucked it up.

146
00:14:00,325 --> 00:14:02,425
Now she's out there on her own.

147
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,000
Which way did she go?

148
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,150
She'd gone by the time I came back.

149
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,400
She must have walked towards the forest.

150
00:14:12,025 --> 00:14:15,225
The river would be impossible to cross.

151
00:14:15,475 --> 00:14:18,225
She'll need to stay on high ground.

152
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,425
That's good to know.

153
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,375
Use my maps.

154
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I've mapped the footpath.

155
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,125
Thanks.

156
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:31,200
Find her before she
does something stupid.

157
00:14:34,575 --> 00:14:37,300
That path leads to the forest.

158
00:14:37,425 --> 00:14:40,075
It's steep. She can't have gone far.

159
00:14:40,325 --> 00:14:44,275
The roads are closed for
three miles in each direction.

160
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,600
Send the dogs out. Can you
stay here to co-ordinate?

161
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,075
Tech's coming. We'll
establish a helicopter link.

162
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:58,340
- I'll liaise with everyone from here.
- We'll find her.

163
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,300
I used to listen to you...

164
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,250
when you were little.

165
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,400
I could tell...

166
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,200
even in the dark...

167
00:15:57,325 --> 00:15:59,375
when you'd fallen asleep.

168
00:16:01,025 --> 00:16:03,025
I didn't have to look.

169
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,325
Your breathing changed.

170
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I held my breath...

171
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,125
until you breathed again.

172
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,600
Come back to me, Con.

173
00:16:23,475 --> 00:16:24,475
Please.

174
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,475
I don't know what you've done.

175
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,250
But I want you to tell me.

176
00:16:36,025 --> 00:16:38,025
I want to listen to you.

177
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,475
I'm receiving images
from the thermal camera.

178
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,075
No sign of her so far.

179
00:17:21,075 --> 00:17:25,475
This is DS Vaughan at base. Can
I get the coordinates on the dogs?

180
00:17:28,425 --> 00:17:32,075
It's a real manhunt. She's only a child.

181
00:17:32,325 --> 00:17:34,550
Who's suspected of two murders.

182
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:42,125
Maybe she's right. Maybe I did
let her down, maybe we all have.

183
00:17:45,475 --> 00:17:47,075
She's so clever.

184
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,500
She could do so much.

185
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,375
We know what she's capable of.

186
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,100
There she is.

187
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,450
Possible sighting.

188
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:41,150
11 44 57, repeat 11 44 57.

189
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,175
You're close to her. Can
you see the helicopter?

190
00:18:48,425 --> 00:18:50,425
I hear it.

191
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,400
Keep this channel open.

192
00:19:05,475 --> 00:19:06,550
I see her.

193
00:19:07,175 --> 00:19:11,200
She's walking 100 metres ahead of you.

194
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,150
Take the next left.

195
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:37,575
DCI John. I see her.

196
00:19:39,075 --> 00:19:41,275
Keep the dogs back.

197
00:19:41,525 --> 00:19:43,525
All units to stay back.

198
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,375
Mia.

199
00:20:19,575 --> 00:20:21,050
Mia.

200
00:20:27,175 --> 00:20:28,275
Mia.

201
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,350
Is this all for me?

202
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,025
It's over, Mia.

203
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,250
I'll say when it's over.

204
00:21:29,075 --> 00:21:31,075
Let go of the knife.

205
00:21:52,425 --> 00:21:54,425
Come and get it.

206
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,300
Give me the knife.

207
00:24:41,325 --> 00:24:45,705
- How's it going with Lee Williams?
- He's something else. I'll get him.

208
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:49,125
See you on the other side.

(TAPE RECORDER BLEEPS)

210
00:25:41,425 --> 00:25:43,300
It's one o'clock...

211
00:25:43,425 --> 00:25:47,300
on Wednesday the 27th of March.

212
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,025
Present are DCI Cadi John...

213
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:54,050
solicitor William Jenkins...

214
00:25:54,175 --> 00:25:57,175
please state your name for the tape.

Mia Owen.

216
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:02,475
Mia, you're a child
in the eyes of the law.

217
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:07,575
I've a feeling you don't
want to be treated as a child.

218
00:26:12,225 --> 00:26:15,150
This folder contains evidence...

219
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,500
facts.

220
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:23,125
A copy of your DNA profile.

221
00:26:23,575 --> 00:26:28,225
Your DNA was found on a
cigarette in Geraint Elis's home.

222
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:33,575
We can say with certainty
that you were there.

223
00:26:34,475 --> 00:26:38,375
When the report into Sion
Wells's murder arrives...

224
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,200
I'm sure we'll be able to
confirm that you were there, too.

225
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,425
I have a theory.

226
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:04,200
We're cruel to those we
see ourselves in them...

227
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,475
some sort of self-loathing...

228
00:27:08,025 --> 00:27:10,500
punishing them for our weaknesses.

229
00:27:11,225 --> 00:27:12,225
Deep.

230
00:27:16,025 --> 00:27:19,025
Is that why you attacked Geraint Elis?

231
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,225
You saw yourself in him.

232
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,600
Lonely, weak...

233
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
no friends or family.

234
00:27:29,425 --> 00:27:33,425
You saw what the future
held for you in the old man.

235
00:27:34,475 --> 00:27:37,475
You'll have to do a
lot better than that.

236
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,475
You broke his ribs...

237
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,375
his cheekbone...

238
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,425
you strangled and drowned him.

239
00:28:01,575 --> 00:28:04,125
He suffered for a long time.

240
00:28:08,225 --> 00:28:10,225
No-one cared about him.

241
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,550
No-one noticed he'd died.

242
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,200
That's the truth.

243
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:18,400
Then they all showed up in church.

244
00:28:18,525 --> 00:28:20,150
Because they cared.

245
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,100
Because they had nothing better to do.

246
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:30,350
Queued up to pay their respects to
a man they didn't give a fuck about.

247
00:28:42,025 --> 00:28:44,025
I saw books in your bedroom.

248
00:28:44,275 --> 00:28:46,375
Do you like reading?

249
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:52,550
Who's your favourite author?

250
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:05,275
Some people read to
understand the world...

251
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,250
others to escape from it.

252
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:16,550
- My father read...
- Your father?

253
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:22,000
The one who let Dylan
Harries get away with it?

254
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:25,250
The one who jailed the wrong man?

255
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,500
The one who prolonged
the girls' suffering?

256
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:34,100
He's dead now, isn't he?

257
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:38,350
Did people come to his
funeral and pretend to cry...

258
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:42,050
pretend they cared?

259
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,075
He's gone.

260
00:29:45,225 --> 00:29:48,100
Only you are left. His bloodline.

261
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,500
You're as useless as he was.

262
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,500
Mia's in custody.

263
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,025
She's clever. There's
one in every family.

264
00:30:11,275 --> 00:30:14,175
It was my cousin in my family, too.

265
00:30:14,575 --> 00:30:17,100
Everything came easily to him.

266
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,250
School, exams.

267
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,100
They were never easy for me.

268
00:30:24,475 --> 00:30:26,475
It got on my nerves.

269
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:34,350
The thing is, she's younger
than you, still in school.

270
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:39,175
The jury would see her and
think you led her astray.

271
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,100
She has never been in trouble before...

272
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,225
unlike you and your brother.

273
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,250
It doesn't look good for you.

274
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:06,375
If I were you, I'd want to
tell my side of the story.

275
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:12,125
I'd put money on it that she
could run rings around you.

276
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,250
You live with your father.

277
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,325
Being a carer is hard work.

278
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,600
It must be hard to
see someone you love...

279
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:38,375
depending on other people...

280
00:31:40,375 --> 00:31:43,105
- not being able to do anything.
- Shut it.

281
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:45,525
What'll happen to him if you go down?

282
00:31:46,025 --> 00:31:48,475
- Shut it.
- Will your brother care for him?

283
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,600
Is he good with your father?

284
00:31:52,325 --> 00:31:55,740
- He doesn't strike me as a carer.
- Shut your fucking mouth!

285
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,025
Sit down!

286
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,100
It was all Mia.

287
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:31,350
I did what she told me to do.

288
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:44,525
She said we were putting
him out of his misery.

289
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,425
He was a fucking paedo, anyway.

290
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,425
And Sion Wells?

291
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,550
Was he a paedo, too?

292
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:13,825
- They can't leave Dad with Jason.
- I don't know.

293
00:33:16,325 --> 00:33:17,550
I don't know.

294
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I thought I'd find you here.

295
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,600
Lee's started to talk.

296
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,300
The night they killed Elis,
there was no masterplan.

297
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:53,250
They broke in for a laugh.

298
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:58,050
The old man came home and
things got out of hand.

299
00:33:58,325 --> 00:34:01,025
The next thing, he was on the floor.

300
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,400
Was Connor there?

301
00:34:02,525 --> 00:34:07,125
Mia told Connor and Lee to
put the body in the bath.

302
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:12,050
It was Mia's idea to go
back to the petrol station.

303
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,500
According to Lee, she
has always been the same.

304
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,325
She has to have complete control.

305
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,300
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

306
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,350
I know that look.

307
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:40,300
- Alys, anything on the laptop?
- The report's on your desk.

(TAPE RECORDER BLEEPS)

309
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:22,100
The interview is resumed at 1.45pm.

310
00:35:42,075 --> 00:35:44,075
Remember Gwilym Scott?

311
00:35:47,575 --> 00:35:51,250
He was fourteen when he killed himself.

312
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,475
He stepped in front of a train.

313
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,550
I have a photo...

314
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,300
of you together.

315
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:14,475
Gwilym was being bullied online...

316
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,275
by someone...

317
00:36:17,525 --> 00:36:21,250
someone who knew
personal things about him.

318
00:36:21,375 --> 00:36:24,550
- I didn't touch him.
- You befriended him...

319
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,400
a lonely boy...

320
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,600
always on his own.

321
00:36:31,225 --> 00:36:34,325
You made him feel he
could talk to you...

322
00:36:36,025 --> 00:36:38,200
that he could trust you.

323
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,550
Good feeling, wasn't it?

324
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:45,125
The feeling that you could control him.

325
00:36:47,225 --> 00:36:52,225
But then, Gwilym began to
attend the youth centre.

326
00:36:54,525 --> 00:36:57,600
You felt the control disappearing.

327
00:37:01,275 --> 00:37:05,050
Others showed an interest in him...

328
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,350
wanted to help him.

329
00:37:10,025 --> 00:37:12,025
You couldn't have that.

330
00:37:12,575 --> 00:37:15,600
You needed complete control over him.

331
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:19,150
- I didn't touch him.
- You didn't have to.

332
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:25,450
The power of the written word, Mia.

333
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:32,125
You know all about that.

334
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,100
The anonymous comments...

335
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:38,025
cruel messages...

336
00:37:39,475 --> 00:37:42,025
all designed to destroy him.

337
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,025
It's all on your laptop, Mia.

338
00:37:54,225 --> 00:37:59,025
After Gwilym committed suicide,
you visited his foster parents.

339
00:38:01,175 --> 00:38:03,175
How did that feel?

340
00:38:05,225 --> 00:38:09,500
Sitting there, knowing you
were responsible for their pain.

341
00:38:15,575 --> 00:38:17,575
Was it all a game?

342
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:23,450
Then, a year later...

343
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:27,200
a new boy starts in school...

344
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:30,200
one who looked just as lost.

345
00:38:32,475 --> 00:38:34,475
Do you know where Connor is?

346
00:38:36,075 --> 00:38:39,025
- No.
- In a coma in hospital.

347
00:38:40,475 --> 00:38:43,250
He tried to kill himself, too.

348
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:50,375
- Will he be OK?
- Hard to say.

349
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,050
Your cousin Lee told us everything...

350
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:04,125
how you broke into Geraint Elis's
house and things got out of hand.

351
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:07,575
He also described what
happened in the garage.

352
00:39:14,575 --> 00:39:17,025
Why did you kill Sion Wells?

353
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,550
Because I felt like doing it.

354
00:39:39,475 --> 00:39:42,375
Interview terminated at 1.52pm.

355
00:39:52,075 --> 00:39:54,350
Do you want me to say sorry?

356
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,200
My father...

357
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:04,425
wasn't perfect.

358
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:08,075
He made mistakes. People do.

359
00:40:10,475 --> 00:40:13,225
But he recognized people's worth.

360
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:16,100
He had a sense of self-worth.

361
00:40:16,225 --> 00:40:19,250
He made sure I had a
sense of self-worth.

362
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:27,125
I'm sorry no-one ever taught you that.

363
00:40:30,175 --> 00:40:32,050
Take her.

364
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,525
Don't feel sorry for me.

365
00:40:41,225 --> 00:40:43,225
Wherever I go...

366
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,550
I always make new friends.

367
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,500
It wasn't your fault, Mam.

368
00:43:57,125 --> 00:43:58,250
Connor, please.

369
00:43:58,375 --> 00:43:59,375
No.

370
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,375
Hear me out.

371
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:07,375
You will blame yourself.

372
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:11,300
I know you.

373
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
It's not your fault.

374
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I could've stopped it.

375
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:29,350
I wanted to belong to something...

376
00:44:34,575 --> 00:44:36,575
be a part of something.

377
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,500
I'm sorry, Mam.

378
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,225
Hush.

379
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,050
Does Liam know?

380
00:44:54,075 --> 00:44:55,325
Not everything.

381
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:57,350
Not yet.

382
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:11,000
We've charged Mia and Lee. The
case for remand is with CPS.

383
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,125
Connor's awake.

384
00:45:19,375 --> 00:45:21,375
That's good news.

385
00:45:22,175 --> 00:45:24,175
He's being assessed now.

386
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:28,175
They'll let us know when
he's well enough to come in.

387
00:45:39,075 --> 00:45:41,075
On we go.

388
00:45:47,175 --> 00:45:49,175
You should go home.

389
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:54,200
See you tomorrow.

390
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,475
You will, Owen.

391
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,200
Hello.

392
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,150
We're in here.

393
00:46:49,375 --> 00:46:50,600
Long day?

394
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,100
Yes.

395
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:55,175
- You've been busy.
- We've almost finished.

396
00:46:55,425 --> 00:46:58,450
Beth kept me going with
the promise of wine.

397
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:03,200
What about this?

398
00:47:04,075 --> 00:47:05,450
Keep or throw away?

399
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,125
Keep.

400
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,350
Just that.

401
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:14,400
Do something useful.

402
00:47:15,025 --> 00:47:16,575
- I'm thirsty.
- OK.

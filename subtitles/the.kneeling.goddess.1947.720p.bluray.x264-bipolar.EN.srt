00:00:00,292 --> 00:00:04,501
The film material of this movie
has been preserved...

2
00:00:04,792 --> 00:00:07,584
...by Filmoteca de la UNAM.

3
00:00:07,876 --> 00:00:11,751
This movie was digitalized by
the Laboratory of Film Restoration...

4
00:00:12,042 --> 00:00:15,501
...of Cineteca Nacional, from a
35 mm negative nitrate film.

5
00:00:15,792 --> 00:00:19,876
"The Kneeling Goddess" belongs to
the Collection of Fundation Televisa A.C.

6
00:00:20,167 --> 00:00:23,334
This version is the result of a joint
conservation project...

7
00:00:23,626 --> 00:00:27,001
...between Cineteca Nacional Mexico and
Fundación Televisa A.C...

8
00:00:27,292 --> 00:00:29,709
...in order to preserve Mexican Cinema.

9
00:00:54,042 --> 00:00:57,792
THE KNEELING GODDESS

10
00:03:27,626 --> 00:03:30,167
- How many days now?
- Why think about that?

11
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:33,001
It would spoil the little time
we have left.

12
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:34,876
Is it little, then?

13
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:36,376
This time it is.

14
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:40,542
What I mean is time
will be completely ours someday.

15
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,251
Don't worry, Antonio,
I understand.

16
00:03:56,917 --> 00:04:01,751
I never ask you anything.
I've never wanted to ask you anything.

17
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:04,584
That's a proof of our love.

18
00:04:04,876 --> 00:04:09,584
Never inquire about the mystery of
the past, if we truly love our love.

19
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:14,334
But it is so difficult to be strong
in loneliness and we meet so seldom.

20
00:04:14,626 --> 00:04:18,209
Let us never abandon each other.
It would be like dying.

21
00:04:18,542 --> 00:04:21,251
Then, let us shut our eyes...

22
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:23,667
...and live that dream.

23
00:04:32,834 --> 00:04:37,167
I will keep them closed so my soul
doesn't escape from this dream.

24
00:04:37,834 --> 00:04:40,376
Kiss me again, Antonio.

25
00:04:56,209 --> 00:05:00,917
Mexicana Airlines announces the departure
of flight 505 to Mexico City.

26
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:04,126
Passengers, please board the aircraft.

27
00:05:06,042 --> 00:05:09,709
I can't help it, Antonio.
Everything between us is so brief.

28
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:14,459
Don't get impatient, I'll write.
I'll be back on September 25th.

29
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,292
Goodbye then.

30
00:06:03,917 --> 00:06:05,959
What? Are you moved?

31
00:06:06,626 --> 00:06:10,834
It's funny, you've become sentimental.
A serious flaw in business.

32
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:15,084
Don't tell me you're falling in love.

33
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,251
Stop it.

34
00:06:18,001 --> 00:06:20,542
This is stronger than my will.

35
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:25,209
Antonio is different from the rest.

36
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:29,876
But don't worry, Nacho.

37
00:06:39,584 --> 00:06:42,376
We said that nothing could
destroy our bond...

38
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:44,001
...except for ourselves.

39
00:06:45,084 --> 00:06:48,584
Don't blame me.
I'm the one who is destroying it.

40
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:52,501
Neither of us
should have a past. True.

41
00:06:53,126 --> 00:06:58,001
But if you were ever to hear about mine,
you'd know I don't deserve you.

42
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:04,209
I don't want to go on deceiving you
and I can't let you know the truth either.

43
00:07:04,876 --> 00:07:06,251
Forget me.

44
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:07,876
Goodbye.

45
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:18,667
Come in, José.

46
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:24,209
Here is the letter. You shan't forget
the instructions, shall you?

47
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:25,959
Don't worry, Miss Raquel.

48
00:07:26,251 --> 00:07:30,459
As soon as that man comes,
I'll deliver him the letter.

49
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:34,126
- If he asks where you went...?
- Tell him you don't know anything.

50
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:36,792
- Good night, José.
- Good night, miss.

51
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:40,917
And believe me,
I am going to miss you dearly.

52
00:08:07,376 --> 00:08:10,459
"So, ratifying our contract...

53
00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:15,459
...we'd like you to send us your
approval as soon as possible.

54
00:08:16,001 --> 00:08:17,209
Sincerely.

55
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:21,584
Mexico City.
September 25th".

56
00:08:27,126 --> 00:08:28,834
September 25th.

57
00:08:30,751 --> 00:08:34,459
This is the act from yesterday's
council for your approval, sir.

58
00:08:50,084 --> 00:08:53,584
WEAR DESIRE
LOVERS' PERFUME

59
00:08:58,917 --> 00:09:02,417
Let's leave it until
I return from Guadalajara.

60
00:09:07,334 --> 00:09:08,876
Good day, sir.

61
00:09:09,292 --> 00:09:10,959
Everything is ready.

62
00:09:11,334 --> 00:09:15,667
- Here is your airplane ticket.
- Thank you very much, Esteban.

63
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:19,334
I almost forgot
that you were coming.

64
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,334
Look out the window
across the street.

65
00:09:24,626 --> 00:09:25,792
Yes, sir.

66
00:09:26,084 --> 00:09:28,751
That sign they're putting up...
a perfume.

67
00:09:30,126 --> 00:09:32,209
- "Desire"?
- Yes, "Desire".

68
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:37,251
Tell me, Esteban.
What does desire mean to you?

69
00:09:38,876 --> 00:09:41,001
The word itself says it, sir.

70
00:09:41,501 --> 00:09:44,376
It is what one longs for,
what one wants...

71
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,376
That is, what one desires.

72
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:53,167
Exactly. It's also a force that makes you,
that drives you to get what you want...

73
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:56,417
...and to keep it
if you already have it, right?

74
00:09:57,459 --> 00:09:58,376
Yes, sir.

75
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:03,251
That force can grow, take on a shape,
become free, greater than you.

76
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:06,084
Then, it ends up destroying you.

77
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:10,126
And, what's worse,
destroying those close to you.

78
00:10:14,042 --> 00:10:15,376
Elena?

79
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:18,251
- Yes?
- I want to say goodbye.

80
00:10:18,542 --> 00:10:21,959
I have a surprise. I decided
to put off my trip to Guadalajara.

81
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:24,459
But, wasn't it urgent?

82
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:28,126
It is no longer necessary.
The matter I had to handle...

83
00:10:28,417 --> 00:10:30,167
...I have solved definitively.

84
00:10:31,584 --> 00:10:33,626
Yes. I'll be right over.

85
00:10:34,042 --> 00:10:35,334
Goodbye.

86
00:10:37,251 --> 00:10:40,334
My talk about desire
must have bewildered you.

87
00:10:40,626 --> 00:10:42,542
But there was a purpose to it.

88
00:10:42,834 --> 00:10:45,667
For a long time, I've gotten
the feeling you desire...

89
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:47,417
...to take a vacation. Here.

90
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:53,001
Sir, me... on a plane...
I've never flown before in my life.

91
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:56,876
Flying without an airplane
would be dangerous.

92
00:10:57,167 --> 00:11:00,001
Miss, let's finish the dictation.
Come at once.

93
00:11:00,501 --> 00:11:03,042
Wait for me outside.
We'll go home together.

94
00:11:03,334 --> 00:11:04,417
Yes, sir.

95
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:27,542
Antonio, I was so happy
that you put off your trip.

96
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:31,042
Now... Now, I am completely happy.

97
00:11:31,542 --> 00:11:34,876
Come. We're going
to do many things together.

98
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:37,876
We'll refurbish.
We'll pretty up the house.

99
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:42,292
- Yes, Elena. Anything you want.
- Look, finish the fountain.

100
00:11:42,584 --> 00:11:45,042
It'll be ready long before
our anniversary.

101
00:11:45,334 --> 00:11:48,959
- Don't you think it'll be beautiful?
- Yes, very beautiful.

102
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:52,792
But incomplete. What's the same
as saying: "Not so beautiful".

103
00:11:53,084 --> 00:11:57,126
Something incomplete does not lack
in beauty. There is Venus de Milo.

104
00:11:57,417 --> 00:12:00,501
True. And Schubert's
Incomplete Symphony.

105
00:12:01,584 --> 00:12:02,834
Venus of Milo?

106
00:12:03,792 --> 00:12:08,667
That's it! You got it. That's what the
fountain will need once it is finished.

107
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,501
Something like the Venus, would be
the best anniversary present for me.

108
00:12:14,042 --> 00:12:15,376
You're terrible.

109
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:16,709
Really.

110
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:19,959
Go to Demetrio's studio
and pick out a nice sculpture.

111
00:12:20,251 --> 00:12:23,376
- Something in your taste. All right?
- All right.

112
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:27,501
The package of books you ordered
from the library is in your laboratory.

113
00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:30,334
Doctor Vidaurri has arrived, madam.

114
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,959
I will be right there.

115
00:12:33,584 --> 00:12:36,917
Elena.
Have you been feeling ill again?

116
00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:38,751
It's nothing, darling.

117
00:12:39,084 --> 00:12:41,167
The usual treatment.

118
00:12:42,001 --> 00:12:44,751
I will call you as soon
as the meal is ready.

119
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:57,167
Raquel and I bade farewell
with our usual secret inquietude.

120
00:13:57,542 --> 00:13:59,292
Would we meet again?

121
00:14:00,251 --> 00:14:02,459
Would that be the last time?

122
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:05,001
Or, would there be others?

123
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:17,959
Now I can answer
those questions.

124
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:21,251
After a terrible struggle,
I defeated desire.

125
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:23,042
Raquel...

126
00:14:23,334 --> 00:14:25,292
...the woman who reincarnated it...

127
00:14:25,584 --> 00:14:28,001
...has been banned
from my life forever.

128
00:15:19,334 --> 00:15:21,042
The Kneeling Goddess.

129
00:15:38,876 --> 00:15:42,667
That's what Demetrio called her.
Although she is really...

130
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:47,376
...a simple woman on her knees,
just like all men like to see women.

131
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,167
What are you doing here?
Why are you talking that way?

132
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:58,251
I warned you, you'd be disappointed
when you saw the real me.

133
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:01,042
You warned me?

134
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:06,834
Antonio, fancy meeting you here!

135
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:10,792
You've come to see her, haven't you?
Look, isn't she fabulous?

136
00:16:11,084 --> 00:16:14,084
Her name is quite adequate.
The Kneeling Goddess.

137
00:16:14,376 --> 00:16:18,376
The name, it's my masterpiece!
Who told you that was its name?

138
00:16:19,084 --> 00:16:22,042
Mysterious voices in your studio
explain it all.

139
00:16:22,334 --> 00:16:27,209
Look, such pureness in lines.
Her torso is absolutely classic...

140
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:31,001
...the outline of her leg is
the prettiest thing I've seen...

141
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:33,792
...and the whole form
is the consummation...

142
00:16:34,084 --> 00:16:36,126
...of the most perfect equilibrium.

143
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:38,626
Difficult to surpass by anybody.

144
00:16:39,042 --> 00:16:41,667
- I've come to buy her from you.
- Buy her?

145
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:46,459
Naturally. I wouldn't have expected less
from a connoisseur like you.

146
00:16:46,792 --> 00:16:48,959
It is a gift for Elena.

147
00:16:49,251 --> 00:16:53,042
Nothing more fitting. You are giving
your wife immortality.

148
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:57,251
That means that I am entitled
to a part of it.

149
00:16:57,542 --> 00:17:00,126
How much does the whole
immortality cost?

150
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:03,542
Let's not discuss money now,
it makes me nauseous.

151
00:17:03,834 --> 00:17:08,542
Tell me about her. So, you have fallen
in love. That would be my greatest feat!

152
00:17:09,001 --> 00:17:11,876
I made her to inspire love.
To bring about desire.

153
00:17:12,292 --> 00:17:14,167
You fulfill your mission.

154
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:16,917
When I look at her
I feel like I know her.

155
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:19,376
As if a distant evocation
had turned to marble.

156
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:24,209
Exactly! That is how I felt in Rome
when I saw the work of Michelangelo.

157
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:31,542
When may I send for her?

158
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:34,792
It's hard to say. She isn't finished,
though she seems to be.

159
00:17:35,084 --> 00:17:37,417
- I'm a blasphemous. What is missing?
- Everything.

160
00:17:37,709 --> 00:17:40,709
The last strike of the chisel.
The one that will give her life.

161
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:44,084
You'll have to wait
a month, a year perhaps.

162
00:17:44,376 --> 00:17:47,626
If it's less than a century,
let me know and send the receipt.

163
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:49,251
Goodbye, Demetrio.

164
00:18:02,542 --> 00:18:05,501
She's ready! The receipt
shall be ready tomorrow.

165
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:10,126
- Does he usually buy statues?
- What do you mean by "usually"?

166
00:18:10,417 --> 00:18:13,292
- Is it an addiction?
- That's not what I meant.

167
00:18:13,584 --> 00:18:15,542
He seems like a strange fellow.

168
00:18:15,876 --> 00:18:19,042
No. Different.
Of course, not at all like us.

169
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:22,376
What about her?

170
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:26,459
She's so fake and supernatural
you could call her a true wife.

171
00:18:27,167 --> 00:18:31,251
- Somewhat insufferable, of course.
- Quite the opposite, at least from him.

172
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:33,959
He adores her.
He sees through her eyes.

173
00:18:35,834 --> 00:18:37,959
Even when he looks at other women?

174
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:42,667
He would never do such a thing.
You'd be wasting your time.

175
00:18:43,709 --> 00:18:45,001
Could be.

176
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:15,001
No, Antonio, this shows that
we are trying to flee from each other.

177
00:19:15,292 --> 00:19:18,917
Don't blame me, Raquel.
Sometimes what we do is determined...

178
00:19:19,209 --> 00:19:20,834
...by dark, secret impulses.

179
00:19:21,251 --> 00:19:25,417
When I saw you today, my memories
suddenly blended like an avalanche.

180
00:19:25,876 --> 00:19:28,584
Memories?
What good are words?

181
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,292
We have before us a reality
greater than all words.

182
00:19:33,042 --> 00:19:36,751
We live in different worlds.
That is our reality.

183
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:40,626
But we have met again and
we cannot deny what it means.

184
00:19:41,167 --> 00:19:45,209
Yes. Our madness was to imagine
that we could live without the past.

185
00:19:45,626 --> 00:19:48,667
Don't take away my right
to the one thing I've left.

186
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:50,542
My own future.

187
00:19:51,292 --> 00:19:53,209
I'm not taking it from you.

188
00:19:54,876 --> 00:19:56,751
I want to be a part of it.

189
00:19:57,417 --> 00:19:59,167
Take me home, Antonio.

190
00:20:20,876 --> 00:20:23,251
We'd better say goodbye here.

191
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:25,292
Goodbye.

192
00:22:36,292 --> 00:22:39,167
There is nothing worse
than deceiving oneself.

193
00:22:45,584 --> 00:22:47,792
All my struggle was in vain.

194
00:22:53,876 --> 00:22:56,876
I understand
that it is stronger than I.

195
00:23:48,917 --> 00:23:51,126
Madam shouldn't have come down.

196
00:23:51,417 --> 00:23:54,376
Don't worry, I feel well.

197
00:23:54,751 --> 00:23:58,167
Please reconsider,
the effort is too large.

198
00:24:00,584 --> 00:24:03,334
I shall have to make
larger efforts yet!

199
00:24:25,042 --> 00:24:26,376
Antonio!

200
00:24:40,667 --> 00:24:43,751
What are you doing here?
You shouldn't have come down.

201
00:24:44,042 --> 00:24:45,501
The doctor forbade you to.

202
00:24:46,334 --> 00:24:50,292
I'm the one who should reprimand you.
You haven't slept a wink.

203
00:24:50,584 --> 00:24:54,917
I... had to finish an analysis.
Besides, that doesn't matter.

204
00:25:05,126 --> 00:25:08,334
You haven't been taking
care of yourself, Elena.

205
00:25:09,292 --> 00:25:13,626
I should be taking care of you
although it may seem like a contradiction.

206
00:25:15,709 --> 00:25:18,376
I get the feeling you're
in grave danger, Antonio.

207
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:22,126
It's your imagination. The only way
nothing will happen to me...

208
00:25:22,417 --> 00:25:24,417
...is knowing you are in good health.

209
00:25:24,709 --> 00:25:28,084
Rest assured, I am a lot
stronger than you imagine.

210
00:25:29,834 --> 00:25:32,376
Nobody will tear me
apart from you.

211
00:25:34,251 --> 00:25:35,917
Why do you say that?

212
00:25:36,876 --> 00:25:39,959
Women always feel a threat
as it approaches.

213
00:25:40,251 --> 00:25:43,542
You are surrounded by ghosts
and schemes that don't exist.

214
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,417
Love is never deceived!

215
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:49,792
I can see beyond your eyes,
your sleepless nights and worries...

216
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:55,834
I don't want you to be alone. I've decided
not to return to the Rochester clinic.

217
00:25:56,126 --> 00:25:58,251
What?
That is madness.

218
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:01,792
- Don't play games with your health.
- Our love's health is first!

219
00:26:02,084 --> 00:26:03,042
Stop insisting!

220
00:26:03,792 --> 00:26:06,959
You could truly compromise it
If you stay.

221
00:26:12,626 --> 00:26:13,876
All right.

222
00:26:14,834 --> 00:26:18,334
I will return to the clinic
after our anniversary.

223
00:26:19,334 --> 00:26:21,876
There is the risk
that it may be the last.

224
00:26:43,876 --> 00:26:44,959
POISON

225
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:34,792
Maybe I'll find a door out.

226
00:27:35,751 --> 00:27:37,501
A determination.

227
00:27:38,126 --> 00:27:39,459
The only one.

228
00:27:39,876 --> 00:27:42,626
Although it may be the most
extreme and painful.

229
00:28:11,751 --> 00:28:14,917
I am like a man returning
from a storm, Raquel.

230
00:28:15,792 --> 00:28:18,334
I wandered for hours
and didn't even notice.

231
00:28:18,626 --> 00:28:22,334
Lonely and isolated, as if
I were in a big, empty house.

232
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:26,001
I would have liked
to walk without stopping.

233
00:28:26,292 --> 00:28:29,876
Not interrupting an escape that
suddenly seemed impossible.

234
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:33,001
Then, I decided to return,
do you understand?

235
00:28:34,042 --> 00:28:38,209
Taking your shadow with me was foolish
for I couldn't get away from it.

236
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:44,459
The image of you was everywhere.
Alive and terrible to despair.

237
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:49,459
You wanted it this way,
Antonio.

238
00:28:49,751 --> 00:28:52,584
I tried to leave, but you
united our fates again.

239
00:28:53,501 --> 00:28:56,334
Now you must have the courage
for your truth.

240
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:58,959
For the truth about both of us.

241
00:28:59,501 --> 00:29:03,542
Either you are mine or you destroy me.
There is no middle ground.

242
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:08,042
Because our love speaks another language.
It says life to death.

243
00:29:08,334 --> 00:29:10,542
Fire to cold,
and words to silence.

244
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:14,459
You must understand this language
with your own life.

245
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:20,376
I too either am yours or destroy you.
With no middle ground, either.

246
00:29:22,459 --> 00:29:26,001
And if we love each other
there shall be no before or after.

247
00:29:26,459 --> 00:29:29,209
It shall be like
the beginning of the world.

248
00:29:35,542 --> 00:29:38,584
I have the strength for that love.
I swear.

249
00:29:39,251 --> 00:29:42,751
Decide within yourself.
If you too have the strength...

250
00:29:43,042 --> 00:29:47,042
...go back to your wife and tell her,
for she will understand.

251
00:29:48,417 --> 00:29:50,084
Is that your condition?

252
00:29:50,876 --> 00:29:52,209
Yes.

253
00:29:52,501 --> 00:29:54,417
Now, go. I'll wait.

254
00:30:41,334 --> 00:30:44,459
No news, sir.
Nobody knows where he is.

255
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:55,251
But that's impossible.

256
00:30:56,084 --> 00:30:59,417
Keep looking,
he has to be somewhere.

257
00:31:01,001 --> 00:31:02,667
I'll be expecting your call.

258
00:31:03,542 --> 00:31:04,792
Thank you.

259
00:31:24,709 --> 00:31:25,709
Come in.

260
00:31:35,834 --> 00:31:38,917
Her husband must know
her condition.

261
00:31:39,334 --> 00:31:44,376
She has to stay in bed and may not
leave her quarters under any circumstance.

262
00:31:44,751 --> 00:31:46,876
I'll be back after midnight.

263
00:31:53,584 --> 00:31:54,834
Antonio.

264
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:57,126
It's me, madam.

265
00:32:02,417 --> 00:32:04,876
Have you any news?
Where is he?

266
00:32:05,167 --> 00:32:08,001
He's coming, madam.
He shan't be long.

267
00:32:09,417 --> 00:32:10,876
Naturally.

268
00:32:12,001 --> 00:32:14,334
He cannot be absent on our day.

269
00:32:14,876 --> 00:32:18,209
I have to get ready.
Tell Maria to come up and help me.

270
00:32:19,876 --> 00:32:22,626
Madam, don't you think
it would be wiser...

271
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:25,626
...to wait for him here,
without such agitation?

272
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:30,292
That's madness! Are you forgetting
that this is our anniversary?

273
00:32:30,584 --> 00:32:34,667
It will be as always.
The same friends, the same bliss.

274
00:32:35,376 --> 00:32:36,834
Go on, tell Maria to come.

275
00:32:57,751 --> 00:32:59,126
I'm sorry, Elena.

276
00:32:59,417 --> 00:33:02,376
You're home now.
I don't want to hear anything.

277
00:34:17,584 --> 00:34:19,834
- Good evening.
- How are you, Antonio?

278
00:34:20,251 --> 00:34:22,417
Is The Kneeling Goddess there?

279
00:34:33,209 --> 00:34:34,917
I waited for you in vain.

280
00:34:35,209 --> 00:34:38,792
I came only to know the reason
of your determination.

281
00:34:39,084 --> 00:34:40,959
Is it lack of love or courage?

282
00:34:44,126 --> 00:34:46,751
You will understand if
you allow me to explain.

283
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:50,042
And if it isn't too late
for an explanation.

284
00:34:50,542 --> 00:34:53,959
Time doesn't count between us.
You know that.

285
00:34:54,376 --> 00:34:56,251
That's what's so terrible.

286
00:35:03,917 --> 00:35:07,084
I told you before, I will allow you
no middle ground.

287
00:35:07,376 --> 00:35:09,376
There will be no before or after.

288
00:35:30,626 --> 00:35:34,667
You don't need an introduction.
You immediately recognized her.

289
00:35:34,959 --> 00:35:36,792
The Kneeling Goddess.

290
00:35:44,292 --> 00:35:47,667
Demetrio insists on saying
that nature copies art.

291
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:50,417
It's not my quote,
but it may as well be.

292
00:35:50,959 --> 00:35:52,626
Everything is ready, madam.

293
00:35:53,834 --> 00:35:55,792
Let us go to the dining room.

294
00:37:07,126 --> 00:37:12,209
MRS. ELENA G. DE ITUARTE
DIED YESTERDAY

295
00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:23,542
THE FAMOUS MODEL RAQUEL SERRANO
IS GOING TO MAKE ONE'S DEBUT

296
00:37:23,834 --> 00:37:26,084
AS A CABARET SINGER IN PANAMA

297
00:37:51,917 --> 00:37:54,251
I got married

298
00:37:54,542 --> 00:37:56,876
I got taken

299
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:04,209
I have fallen in the trap
Set by the woman

300
00:38:06,459 --> 00:38:10,001
In order to marry well,
You've got to be smart

301
00:38:10,292 --> 00:38:13,376
You've got to be submissive
For the catch

302
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:16,667
But once you're married
You've got to show your temper

303
00:38:16,959 --> 00:38:20,584
For by then we must
Not care about our husband

304
00:38:21,001 --> 00:38:23,626
When you get married,
Find yourself a wife

305
00:38:24,042 --> 00:38:27,126
That is elegant
And very beautiful

306
00:38:27,542 --> 00:38:30,834
Because that way
All your life

307
00:38:31,126 --> 00:38:35,876
You may have
A lot of time to lose

308
00:38:36,917 --> 00:38:40,084
And now, gentlemen

309
00:38:40,376 --> 00:38:42,209
You can see for yourselves

310
00:38:42,501 --> 00:38:48,751
What happens to the man
Who searched for a wife

311
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:52,251
I don't know what love is

312
00:38:52,542 --> 00:38:56,292
I am ashamed to confess

313
00:38:56,709 --> 00:39:05,126
In my arms you will know
Why I am a professor

314
00:39:05,959 --> 00:39:09,501
If I do not correspond

315
00:39:10,126 --> 00:39:13,876
Don't hold it against me

316
00:39:14,292 --> 00:39:18,542
My lovely little wife

317
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:24,251
You have a crystal soul

318
00:40:06,751 --> 00:40:08,959
I knew love once.

319
00:40:09,251 --> 00:40:11,334
It is very beautiful.

320
00:40:12,001 --> 00:40:14,584
But for me it was
brief and betraying.

321
00:40:15,792 --> 00:40:18,542
At first it was glorious,
but later became despicable.

322
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:21,626
Its law is pleasure...

323
00:40:22,042 --> 00:40:23,792
...for money.

324
00:40:36,792 --> 00:40:39,709
Love

325
00:40:40,001 --> 00:40:41,792
For you, I drank

326
00:40:42,501 --> 00:40:46,126
My own tears

327
00:40:47,709 --> 00:40:49,376
Love

328
00:40:49,667 --> 00:40:51,751
You were my cross

329
00:40:52,042 --> 00:40:54,167
My religion

330
00:40:56,959 --> 00:41:00,501
Vengeance is fair

331
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:04,001
And in the meantime

332
00:41:06,251 --> 00:41:12,501
Let us live
Deceiving our hearts

333
00:41:15,001 --> 00:41:16,542
Love

334
00:41:16,834 --> 00:41:18,792
For you I drank

335
00:41:19,084 --> 00:41:21,917
My own tears

336
00:41:23,834 --> 00:41:25,376
Love

337
00:41:25,667 --> 00:41:27,792
You were my cross

338
00:41:28,084 --> 00:41:30,626
My religion

339
00:41:33,126 --> 00:41:36,751
Vengeance is fair

340
00:41:37,042 --> 00:41:40,251
And in the meantime

341
00:41:41,626 --> 00:41:47,751
Let us continue
Deceiving our hearts

342
00:41:50,917 --> 00:41:56,959
Let us continue
Deceiving our hearts

343
00:42:10,376 --> 00:42:13,001
To be happy
And live without a care

344
00:42:13,417 --> 00:42:16,042
Don't let your heart speak out

345
00:42:16,376 --> 00:42:19,126
You will live your life
Oblivious to pain

346
00:42:19,542 --> 00:42:22,167
Better to enjoy it,
Better to laugh!

347
00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:23,376
- For you
- For me

348
00:42:23,667 --> 00:42:24,917
- It must be.
- The best

349
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:28,501
Not to marry,
Not to marry

350
00:42:28,792 --> 00:42:31,459
Because, I believe
We will enjoy love more

351
00:42:31,751 --> 00:42:34,751
If we're not married,
Not married

352
00:42:35,042 --> 00:42:37,584
I won't get married,
If I did I would die

353
00:42:38,001 --> 00:42:40,751
Being single,
That is what I prefer

354
00:42:41,126 --> 00:42:43,917
For you, for me,
For everybody

355
00:42:44,209 --> 00:42:47,084
It is best to forget about love

356
00:43:00,709 --> 00:43:03,334
I won't get married,
If I did I would die

357
00:43:03,626 --> 00:43:06,417
Being single,
That is what I prefer

358
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:13,376
For you, for me, for everybody,
It is best to forget about love

359
00:43:55,167 --> 00:43:57,917
So, what are you?
I am Panamanian

360
00:43:58,334 --> 00:44:01,292
Because through my veins runs

361
00:44:01,709 --> 00:44:04,251
Sensual blood

362
00:44:04,542 --> 00:44:07,292
So, what are you?
I am Panamanian

363
00:44:07,959 --> 00:44:12,917
From that garden of dreams
That is my Panama

364
00:44:13,501 --> 00:44:16,501
So, what are you?
I am the owner

365
00:44:16,876 --> 00:44:22,167
Of the joy of my Panama

366
00:44:25,417 --> 00:44:30,501
Panama, tropical bliss

367
00:44:35,417 --> 00:44:36,626
Raquel!

368
00:44:40,626 --> 00:44:43,751
What's wrong? You are
insufferable these days.

369
00:44:44,042 --> 00:44:47,876
The way that man drinks is intolerable.
He hasn't been sober since he arrived.

370
00:44:48,376 --> 00:44:50,709
I think you've taken
this affair much too far.

371
00:44:51,251 --> 00:44:53,792
You don't even know
what his true intentions are.

372
00:44:54,084 --> 00:44:58,667
It seems strange he traveled
thousands of miles only to get drunk.

373
00:44:59,584 --> 00:45:01,834
There's more than meets the eye.

374
00:45:03,626 --> 00:45:06,917
Don't complain,
you've put it to good use.

375
00:45:07,876 --> 00:45:10,751
But if he stays here,
he could get us into a mess.

376
00:45:11,084 --> 00:45:13,709
We should get a good
indemnity out of him...

377
00:45:14,001 --> 00:45:17,292
...and then send him off,
in all courtesy, of course.

378
00:45:19,584 --> 00:45:22,084
It would be best...
to send him off.

379
00:45:29,417 --> 00:45:30,542
What do you want?

380
00:45:31,709 --> 00:45:34,584
For everybody to drink up!
To the last drop.

381
00:45:35,626 --> 00:45:37,501
Until there's nothing left.

382
00:45:41,959 --> 00:45:44,084
No middle ground.

383
00:45:48,292 --> 00:45:50,626
To extermination
or to surrender.

384
00:45:54,959 --> 00:45:57,584
You know what I mean,
don't you?

385
00:45:59,542 --> 00:46:00,792
Here.

386
00:46:14,001 --> 00:46:16,751
Go get a taxi.
Go, what are you waiting for?

387
00:46:21,626 --> 00:46:25,042
Antonio, when will you tell me
what brought you to Panama?

388
00:46:25,459 --> 00:46:26,792
Tell me.

389
00:47:10,917 --> 00:47:13,584
This man is mad.
He meant to kill you.

390
00:47:13,876 --> 00:47:17,709
- We should hand him over to the police.
- I know what's wrong with him.

391
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:22,084
He will bring us trouble. The sooner
we get away from him, the better.

392
00:47:23,126 --> 00:47:24,709
Your taxi is waiting, sir.

393
00:47:25,001 --> 00:47:27,834
Take him to the hotel.
I'll talk to him tomorrow.

394
00:48:17,084 --> 00:48:18,209
Come in.

395
00:48:18,834 --> 00:48:21,459
It's me, Antonio.
I came to say goodbye.

396
00:48:24,834 --> 00:48:26,917
Wait for me. I'll be right out.

397
00:48:46,876 --> 00:48:48,459
I brought you your lighter.

398
00:48:50,917 --> 00:48:53,042
You left it in the dressing room.

399
00:49:00,292 --> 00:49:01,417
How do you feel?

400
00:49:02,917 --> 00:49:04,584
I'm fine now, thank you.

401
00:49:51,209 --> 00:49:52,501
I must go, Antonio.

402
00:49:54,417 --> 00:49:56,126
Wait, we have to talk!

403
00:49:56,834 --> 00:50:00,917
I don't want to be late for rehearsal.
I'll see you at the night club.

404
00:50:21,626 --> 00:50:23,501
Did you get the wire, sir?

405
00:50:23,834 --> 00:50:26,417
- What wire?
- The one I took to your room.

406
00:50:27,501 --> 00:50:28,792
Oh, yes.

407
00:50:29,501 --> 00:50:30,959
Here.

408
00:50:32,126 --> 00:50:36,167
Figaro, Figaro, Figaro

409
00:50:43,126 --> 00:50:45,251
At last.
What a mess!

410
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:49,542
A woman wears so many clothes,
and I had to fix your bags myself.

411
00:50:49,834 --> 00:50:52,167
I packed my stockings,
my panties,

412
00:50:52,459 --> 00:50:57,001
I packed my girdle, I packed...
So much...

413
00:51:05,417 --> 00:51:10,209
The ship leaves at five in the morning.
Sky and sea to open destiny.

414
00:51:11,751 --> 00:51:14,542
To return to our free
and pilgrim existence.

415
00:51:15,376 --> 00:51:17,001
Isn't this wonderful?

416
00:51:18,751 --> 00:51:20,334
"Goodbye...

417
00:51:20,834 --> 00:51:22,167
...Panama".

418
00:51:23,334 --> 00:51:25,626
Nacho, I'm not going with you.

419
00:51:26,042 --> 00:51:27,167
What?

420
00:51:28,334 --> 00:51:31,459
You are joking. That's like
throwing everything away.

421
00:51:31,834 --> 00:51:34,042
I have always lived doing that.

422
00:51:34,584 --> 00:51:38,876
We have always walked together.
It was our only bond.

423
00:51:39,167 --> 00:51:43,542
- Wandering senselessly. Now, it's over.
- What made you change so much?

424
00:51:49,084 --> 00:51:50,209
This.

425
00:51:58,542 --> 00:52:01,542
So, then it wasn't natural
death, was it?

426
00:52:03,501 --> 00:52:07,251
Did you know his wife had died?
Why did you hide it from me?

427
00:52:07,626 --> 00:52:10,001
I thought it was best for us both.

428
00:52:11,376 --> 00:52:14,667
From your perspective. Can you
grasp the meaning of that wire?

429
00:52:15,001 --> 00:52:18,792
Yes. Her death under strange
circumstances means many things.

430
00:52:19,084 --> 00:52:21,084
Do you mean to tell me that now...?

431
00:52:21,376 --> 00:52:24,001
I have come to understand
Antonio truly loves me.

432
00:52:24,292 --> 00:52:28,667
I am not just a simple whim for him.
Now that he is free he comes to me.

433
00:52:29,084 --> 00:52:31,167
He is free by his own hand.

434
00:52:32,126 --> 00:52:35,292
Listen to me.
Antonio has killed for me.

435
00:52:37,792 --> 00:52:41,417
You are so easy to deceive
by your own fabrications!

436
00:52:41,834 --> 00:52:44,584
You made up a triumphant and
extraordinary world...

437
00:52:44,876 --> 00:52:49,001
...where you are the goddess at whose
feet all sacrifices are consummated.

438
00:52:49,626 --> 00:52:52,126
Don't be blinded by the
idea that he killed for you.

439
00:52:52,459 --> 00:52:55,876
You don't know Antonio.
He is capable of any extreme act.

440
00:52:56,584 --> 00:53:00,126
You won't always find a man
who behaves as I do.

441
00:53:02,042 --> 00:53:04,376
Of course.
Spite is blinding you.

442
00:53:05,209 --> 00:53:07,667
Am I to blame for not loving you?

443
00:53:10,792 --> 00:53:12,459
Maybe you're right.

444
00:53:13,292 --> 00:53:14,542
Raquel...

445
00:53:15,501 --> 00:53:18,667
...today was the happiest
day of my life.

446
00:53:19,001 --> 00:53:20,626
Try to understand, Nacho.

447
00:53:21,376 --> 00:53:25,667
I may just be assuming things,
but I found this hidden in his lighter.

448
00:53:34,501 --> 00:53:35,917
Cyanide?

449
00:53:36,584 --> 00:53:39,334
There is enough poison here
to kill a horse.

450
00:53:39,626 --> 00:53:42,376
Could it have been
intended for you? I'm sorry.

451
00:53:43,584 --> 00:53:44,876
You may be right.

452
00:53:45,251 --> 00:53:47,834
It looks like Antonio
poisoned her.

453
00:53:48,251 --> 00:53:52,542
Isn't this irrefutable proof?
What do you think?

454
00:53:53,834 --> 00:53:57,959
You know? It isn't my own love
that has me trapped anymore.

455
00:53:58,292 --> 00:54:00,834
I must have the strength to play out
Antonio's fate...

456
00:54:01,126 --> 00:54:05,334
...without fearing the consequences.
Our passion made me his accomplice.

457
00:54:07,126 --> 00:54:08,042
Be warned!

458
00:54:09,959 --> 00:54:12,709
Our farewell number.

459
00:54:23,709 --> 00:54:26,042
To be happy and live
Without a care

460
00:54:26,459 --> 00:54:29,417
Do not allow
Your heart to speak

461
00:54:29,751 --> 00:54:32,167
You'll live your life
And never suffer

462
00:54:32,584 --> 00:54:35,417
It is better to enjoy it,
Better to laugh!

463
00:54:35,751 --> 00:54:36,751
- For you
- For me

464
00:54:37,042 --> 00:54:38,376
- It must be
- The best

465
00:54:39,001 --> 00:54:41,876
Not to marry,
Not to marry

466
00:54:42,167 --> 00:54:44,876
I believe we will
Enjoy love more

467
00:54:45,209 --> 00:54:48,084
If we're not married,
Do not married

468
00:54:48,376 --> 00:54:50,917
I will not get married,
If I did I would die

469
00:54:51,209 --> 00:54:54,209
Being single,
That is what I prefer

470
00:54:54,626 --> 00:55:00,417
For you, for me, for us,
It is best to forget about love

471
00:55:01,584 --> 00:55:02,709
- For you
- For me

472
00:55:03,042 --> 00:55:04,251
- It must be
- The best

473
00:55:04,542 --> 00:55:07,292
Not to marry,
Not to marry

474
00:55:07,626 --> 00:55:10,584
I believe we will enjoy love better

475
00:55:10,876 --> 00:55:13,751
If we're not married,
Not married

476
00:55:14,042 --> 00:55:16,792
I will not get married,
If I did I would die

477
00:55:17,126 --> 00:55:19,876
Being single is what I prefer

478
00:55:20,292 --> 00:55:26,167
For you, for me, for us,
It is best to forget about love

479
00:55:39,209 --> 00:55:41,959
I will not get married,
If I did, I would die

480
00:55:42,292 --> 00:55:45,126
Being single is what I prefer.

481
00:55:45,459 --> 00:55:51,792
For you, for me, for us,
It is best to forget about love

482
00:56:30,001 --> 00:56:31,876
Eleven thirty in my room.

483
00:56:49,209 --> 00:56:51,626
So, what are you?
I am Panamanian

484
00:56:52,167 --> 00:56:55,126
Because through my veins runs

485
00:56:55,417 --> 00:56:58,084
Sensual blood

486
00:57:20,251 --> 00:57:22,876
- Shall I come and serve?
- I will do it myself.

487
00:57:23,167 --> 00:57:25,501
- Happy New Year, sir.
- Happy New Year.

488
00:57:50,042 --> 00:57:52,042
- Good evening, Antonio.
- Good evening.

489
00:57:52,584 --> 00:57:54,751
Did I keep you waiting?
I didn't mean to.

490
00:57:55,042 --> 00:57:58,167
Just enough time to make
the kind of scenery you deserve.

491
00:57:58,459 --> 00:58:01,667
Didn't Demetrio use to say
"The perfect frame for a work of art"?

492
00:58:02,501 --> 00:58:05,709
Demetrio... all that
is so distant, isn't it?

493
00:58:07,542 --> 00:58:08,876
Yes, very distant.

494
00:58:09,834 --> 00:58:14,667
I think we have had to wander such strange
roads just to get to the same point.

495
00:58:15,709 --> 00:58:17,626
Everything has been so strange.

496
00:58:17,917 --> 00:58:20,292
Also my presence here.

497
00:58:21,292 --> 00:58:22,417
Maybe.

498
00:58:25,751 --> 00:58:27,542
Why did you flee this morning?

499
00:58:28,292 --> 00:58:29,709
What were you afraid of?

500
00:58:31,126 --> 00:58:32,876
Of so many things.

501
00:58:33,209 --> 00:58:35,834
A happy fear
I have not overcome.

502
00:58:36,251 --> 00:58:38,917
That doesn't answer my question.

503
00:58:43,584 --> 00:58:45,126
Why did you flee like that?

504
00:58:47,042 --> 00:58:48,959
I saw things differently.

505
00:58:49,251 --> 00:58:52,626
I submitted myself to
the inevitable presence of your wife.

506
00:58:53,251 --> 00:58:56,251
But now that I know everything
I have no reserves.

507
00:58:56,626 --> 00:59:01,584
If you were capable of killing for love
I too feel capable of sharing your crime.

508
00:59:01,876 --> 00:59:02,876
Here.

509
00:59:04,917 --> 00:59:07,459
Now you shall have me
completely in your hands.

510
00:59:10,376 --> 00:59:13,042
The fact is we are
in each other's hands.

511
00:59:13,542 --> 00:59:15,209
I am also adrift.

512
00:59:15,501 --> 00:59:17,709
I too destroyed
the rope behind me.

513
00:59:18,584 --> 00:59:21,001
Would you rather
I read it to you?

514
00:59:21,626 --> 00:59:25,667
Everything depends on
your attitude after I read it.

515
00:59:37,542 --> 00:59:42,042
You have to know what it says.
It's the honest thing to do.

516
00:59:42,667 --> 00:59:46,417
It is presumed your wife
didn't die of natural causes.

517
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:50,376
Your lawyer seems
to foresee some difficulties.

518
00:59:54,209 --> 00:59:59,042
I was scared to give it to you.
I only opened it because it was from her.

519
01:00:09,626 --> 01:00:13,167
Such a difficult battle
to win your heart over.

520
01:00:23,501 --> 01:00:26,126
God! We're overlooking
the year is dying.

521
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:05,042
The year has ended.

522
01:01:05,334 --> 01:01:08,417
To our listeners,
all sorts of happy wishes.

523
01:01:08,959 --> 01:01:12,917
Joy and well being for the living
and a memory full of gratitude...

524
01:01:13,209 --> 01:01:15,126
...for who are no longer with us.

525
01:01:34,292 --> 01:01:37,376
Joy and well being
for the living, Antonio.

526
01:01:42,459 --> 01:01:44,084
For us, the living.

527
01:03:18,959 --> 01:03:20,334
Thank you, sir.

528
01:03:23,209 --> 01:03:26,751
- Only unpack the things you need.
- Are we leaving right away?

529
01:03:27,042 --> 01:03:29,376
We will be here
as briefly as possible.

530
01:03:29,792 --> 01:03:31,334
I am so glad, Antonio!

531
01:03:32,292 --> 01:03:34,376
Now I believe in our new life.

532
01:03:35,667 --> 01:03:39,084
I have to leave you a few hours.
I need to see my lawyer.

533
01:03:39,376 --> 01:03:43,126
The ticket agency will call
to confirm the time of departure.

534
01:03:43,417 --> 01:03:45,292
We will fly to New York at dawn.

535
01:03:45,626 --> 01:03:49,251
New York, then to Europe.
We will get married in Italy.

536
01:03:50,792 --> 01:03:51,917
I'll be right back.

537
01:05:22,917 --> 01:05:26,667
Sir, I was expecting you
a lot earlier.

538
01:05:28,792 --> 01:05:32,751
- Did you have a good trip, sir?
- Yes, Esteban. Thank you.

539
01:05:33,376 --> 01:05:36,251
Counselor Jiménez
has called several times.

540
01:05:37,876 --> 01:05:39,084
What did you say?

541
01:05:39,376 --> 01:05:42,376
That Counselor Jiménez
has been looking for you.

542
01:05:47,417 --> 01:05:49,126
You wanted to rest.

543
01:05:49,542 --> 01:05:51,834
I will arrange your
bedroom immediately.

544
01:05:52,126 --> 01:05:52,959
Wait.

545
01:05:53,709 --> 01:05:55,042
It seems as if...

546
01:05:55,459 --> 01:05:57,751
...nothing has changed since then.

547
01:05:58,417 --> 01:05:59,959
Who knows, sir.

548
01:06:00,584 --> 01:06:04,417
It seems things never change
and they are always in their place.

549
01:06:05,292 --> 01:06:06,959
But they are not the same.

550
01:06:07,792 --> 01:06:11,084
They are lacking in warmth.
They die, too.

551
01:06:19,376 --> 01:06:23,334
Whole months without
lighting the fireplace.

552
01:06:24,376 --> 01:06:27,834
Everything has become dull
and cold in this house, sir.

553
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:46,042
Counselor.

554
01:06:47,667 --> 01:06:48,667
Just a minute.

555
01:06:49,376 --> 01:06:52,709
- What should I tell him?
- I don't want to talk to him.

556
01:06:54,626 --> 01:06:57,292
He asks you to excuse him...

557
01:06:57,626 --> 01:06:59,917
...and to give me a message.

558
01:07:07,376 --> 01:07:08,626
All right.

559
01:07:09,542 --> 01:07:11,584
I'll convey your message,
counselor.

560
01:07:11,876 --> 01:07:13,209
Goodbye.

561
01:07:22,626 --> 01:07:25,334
Counselor Jiménez said
he will be right over.

562
01:07:25,751 --> 01:07:29,959
He wants to discuss some issues
concerning your late wife's insurance.

563
01:07:30,626 --> 01:07:34,709
Besides, he says it is urgent you
give the names of the witnesses...

564
01:07:35,167 --> 01:07:38,667
...in order to apply
for your new marriage license.

565
01:07:41,834 --> 01:07:45,626
God has granted me life
to contemplate such things.

566
01:07:45,917 --> 01:07:47,209
What am I to do?

567
01:07:50,584 --> 01:07:52,626
You regret it,
don't you, Esteban?

568
01:07:53,959 --> 01:07:57,376
Who am I to regret it, sir,
but a mere old...

569
01:07:57,667 --> 01:08:00,417
...servant who knew your
late wife...

570
01:08:00,834 --> 01:08:04,667
...since she was
barely more than a child.

571
01:08:05,417 --> 01:08:10,251
You cannot tell a heart
by looking at a face.

572
01:08:10,667 --> 01:08:14,084
How can I know what is
going on inside your heart, sir?

573
01:08:14,917 --> 01:08:18,126
You must have you reasons
for doing what you're doing.

574
01:08:18,417 --> 01:08:23,084
Although I agree, that
loneliness is easy for no man.

575
01:08:24,084 --> 01:08:25,334
For none.

576
01:08:26,501 --> 01:08:29,709
There is no worse punishment
than loneliness, Esteban.

577
01:08:32,084 --> 01:08:33,084
Don't go yet.

578
01:08:34,042 --> 01:08:36,917
Stay a bit longer.
Talk to me about her.

579
01:08:38,292 --> 01:08:43,126
I am afraid to sadden you with my memories
which will also make me sad.

580
01:08:45,167 --> 01:08:46,501
This fireplace...

581
01:08:47,584 --> 01:08:51,667
...has aged so much...
that it lets the smoke leak now.

582
01:08:54,126 --> 01:08:56,251
You want memories, sir.

583
01:08:57,209 --> 01:09:01,001
It is natural. Your trip was meant
to help you get over this.

584
01:09:01,292 --> 01:09:02,251
Wasn't it?

585
01:09:03,417 --> 01:09:04,417
My trip!

586
01:09:05,709 --> 01:09:09,626
It was like trying to put out
a fire with a sea of fuel.

587
01:09:10,501 --> 01:09:14,459
But...talk to me.
Tell me about her.

588
01:09:16,417 --> 01:09:21,251
If you will excuse me,
she was a sweet, quiet child.

589
01:09:21,667 --> 01:09:24,959
But inside she was stern
and full of willpower.

590
01:10:32,792 --> 01:10:36,084
I had to save my love from
the dangers that were threatening it.

591
01:10:37,001 --> 01:10:38,792
Elena felt it.

592
01:10:39,626 --> 01:10:43,459
To protect us,
I was prepared to everything.

593
01:10:44,209 --> 01:10:48,917
I must finish with the desire,
by killing the woman that embodies it.

594
01:10:49,251 --> 01:10:52,751
But destiny was
preparing me something different.

595
01:10:53,501 --> 01:10:56,126
It was the night of
our wedding anniversary.

596
01:10:56,417 --> 01:11:00,834
I was about to complete my purpose.
That was the decisive moment.

597
01:11:01,126 --> 01:11:05,209
But, the gaze of Elena got in my way.

598
01:11:06,251 --> 01:11:09,709
I felt she knew everything.
So I had to postpone...

599
01:11:10,001 --> 01:11:14,709
...the terrible moment of what
I thought was going to be my freedom.

600
01:11:16,626 --> 01:11:18,959
Come!
You have to light on the candles.

601
01:11:28,126 --> 01:11:31,959
It was me who suggested Demetrio
to bring Raquel to the party.

602
01:11:32,376 --> 01:11:36,542
I prepare everything
so they could stay at the end.

603
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:40,709
That way, I could prepare everything
I've planned for Raquel.

604
01:11:41,001 --> 01:11:44,417
- Let's go, Demetrio!
- Don't go! Take one last drink!

605
01:11:44,751 --> 01:11:46,209
What do you prefer?

606
01:11:46,876 --> 01:11:51,792
By chance, as if something was
helping me for my crazy purposes...

607
01:11:52,084 --> 01:11:55,001
...each one had asked
for a different beverage.

608
01:11:55,292 --> 01:11:58,042
Elena wanted champagne.
Demetrio, whiskey...

609
01:11:58,584 --> 01:12:01,334
...and Raquel, cognac.

610
01:12:02,834 --> 01:12:06,042
My chemical knowledge
had helped me to calculate all...

611
01:12:06,667 --> 01:12:10,501
...in a few hours, taking into account
Raquel's physical conditions...

612
01:12:10,917 --> 01:12:15,626
...I will achieve the desire effect,
and no one could blame me for her death.

613
01:12:17,584 --> 01:12:18,792
Sir!

614
01:12:20,209 --> 01:12:23,042
But in those moments,
something got my attention.

615
01:12:23,376 --> 01:12:27,251
Dr. Vidaurri wanted to talk to me
about my wife's health...

616
01:12:27,542 --> 01:12:31,251
...and about what had happened
that day, it was severe.

617
01:12:31,542 --> 01:12:34,626
He waited for me at the lab,
he didn't want Elena to see him.

618
01:12:35,584 --> 01:12:41,126
Your wife can live, just if she has a
rigorous diet and if she doesn't have...

619
01:12:41,417 --> 01:12:43,501
...strong or unhappy emotions.

620
01:12:44,334 --> 01:12:46,876
If not, I won't be responsible.

621
01:12:47,501 --> 01:12:50,709
Your wife's life is in your hands.

622
01:12:51,417 --> 01:12:53,084
Good night!

623
01:12:56,334 --> 01:12:58,667
Elena's life is in my hands.

624
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:03,209
I stay there, thinking about
this terrible fact.

625
01:13:03,501 --> 01:13:06,834
I promise to wholly dedicate
myself to Elena.

626
01:13:07,376 --> 01:13:12,626
Meanwhile, in the living room,
the desire must be vanishing...

627
01:13:13,167 --> 01:13:16,126
...Rachel must have drunk the poison.

628
01:13:16,751 --> 01:13:22,001
One minute later, I don't know why,
she left my home with Demetrio.

629
01:13:24,959 --> 01:13:26,959
What happened?
Why did they go?

630
01:13:30,626 --> 01:13:32,834
What are you doing with that drink?

631
01:13:33,459 --> 01:13:34,667
Elena!

632
01:13:34,959 --> 01:13:35,876
Elena!

633
01:13:39,417 --> 01:13:41,126
Elena had drunk the drink.

634
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:46,959
Trying to kill Raquel, an ironic tragedy
made me finish with what I love the most.

635
01:13:47,251 --> 01:13:49,334
I tried all to save her.

636
01:13:50,084 --> 01:13:51,959
But everything was in vain.

637
01:13:52,501 --> 01:13:58,209
Those words were so terrifying and truth.
A man can kill what he loves the most.

638
01:13:58,626 --> 01:14:02,667
A coward man with a kiss,
a brave one with a sword.

639
01:14:04,042 --> 01:14:07,167
These few words surround
my entire tragedy.

640
01:14:08,001 --> 01:14:10,542
I'm the murderer of my wife.

641
01:14:52,959 --> 01:14:56,917
Excuse me, sir.
Mr. Jiménez has just arrived.

642
01:14:57,334 --> 01:14:59,084
I'll be there in a minute.

643
01:15:00,626 --> 01:15:04,376
What are they suggesting? It has been
a murder, not a natural death?

644
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:06,959
They just want to defend themselves.

645
01:15:07,376 --> 01:15:11,126
The expert doctors
doesn't anticipate a sudden death.

646
01:15:11,542 --> 01:15:16,042
Knowing that the policy was bought
by your wife when she was very healthy.

647
01:15:16,334 --> 01:15:18,459
That's why I sent you the telegram.

648
01:15:18,959 --> 01:15:23,417
Assholes! Don't do anything
to obtain the money from that insurance!

649
01:15:23,709 --> 01:15:27,126
Any amount can help me
to compensate Elena's lost.

650
01:15:27,917 --> 01:15:29,959
Ok! Good night!

651
01:16:01,251 --> 01:16:02,209
Hello!

652
01:16:02,501 --> 01:16:06,126
The plane takes off in half an hour,
you have 15 minutes to arrive.

653
01:16:06,417 --> 01:16:07,417
At your service.

654
01:16:26,084 --> 01:16:27,417
707.

655
01:17:27,917 --> 01:17:29,251
Raquel...

656
01:17:29,626 --> 01:17:33,167
...I have to explain you something.

657
01:17:34,334 --> 01:17:37,542
If you prefer not to do it,
I'll understand it.

658
01:17:38,626 --> 01:17:40,376
On the contrary...

659
01:17:40,667 --> 01:17:43,209
...now it's better than ever.

660
01:17:44,376 --> 01:17:46,917
Both of us need this confession.

661
01:17:48,876 --> 01:17:50,417
A confession?

662
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:54,292
I thought everything was clear
between us.

663
01:17:54,584 --> 01:17:59,251
I told you everything on time.
I don't want to go back.

664
01:18:01,459 --> 01:18:02,584
Listen to me.

665
01:18:06,876 --> 01:18:08,667
This is the end.

666
01:18:11,542 --> 01:18:14,751
We can't keep on with this.
I've tried to kill you and...

667
01:18:18,251 --> 01:18:20,542
...I can do it again.

668
01:18:21,626 --> 01:18:24,876
I don't understand anything.
You are mad!

669
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:27,001
What's going on?

670
01:18:34,626 --> 01:18:36,751
I have to tell you everything.

671
01:18:54,501 --> 01:18:58,876
You are very proud because
you're telling me the truth.

672
01:18:59,292 --> 01:19:03,167
Now you think you're so big.
You've always wanted to be like that.

673
01:19:03,459 --> 01:19:06,334
Generous, honest, worthy, pure.

674
01:19:06,792 --> 01:19:08,834
Why did you tell it to me?

675
01:19:09,251 --> 01:19:12,417
Because you feel mercy for me
or for my rotten life?

676
01:19:12,751 --> 01:19:17,292
Are you feeling mercy for you? Or is just
compassion for your own sufferings?

677
01:19:17,667 --> 01:19:19,709
You've never thought
in anything else...

678
01:19:20,001 --> 01:19:22,292
...just in yourself
and in your own salvation.

679
01:19:22,584 --> 01:19:25,584
Your selfishness is wild and strong
because you hide it.

680
01:19:26,709 --> 01:19:29,167
You want to purify your faults
through the others.

681
01:19:30,084 --> 01:19:32,417
Yes, I can see everything.

682
01:19:33,042 --> 01:19:36,042
You tried to kill me and why?

683
01:19:36,709 --> 01:19:38,709
Because you love me
or your wife?

684
01:19:39,001 --> 01:19:43,084
No. You don't love anybody.
You just love yourself...

685
01:19:43,584 --> 01:19:46,501
...your moral and integrity.

686
01:19:49,584 --> 01:19:51,251
Now you're defeated.

687
01:19:52,001 --> 01:19:53,459
You can't kill anybody.

688
01:19:54,917 --> 01:19:56,834
You can't kill me.

689
01:19:57,792 --> 01:20:01,542
You lost your last weapon
when you confess.

690
01:20:02,042 --> 01:20:04,792
It was the strength
that your silence gave you.

691
01:20:09,792 --> 01:20:11,459
You understood everything.

692
01:20:13,834 --> 01:20:16,709
Those are my own words.

693
01:20:17,001 --> 01:20:19,542
I repeated them constantly,
day and night.

694
01:20:23,126 --> 01:20:24,792
Let me get lost!

695
01:20:25,501 --> 01:20:28,167
Don't make me take you to hell.

696
01:20:42,376 --> 01:20:46,167
Why have you come? Why are you
looking at me that way? Go away!

697
01:20:46,459 --> 01:20:49,626
Don't repeat insults
you will regret later.

698
01:20:51,209 --> 01:20:53,292
Now it is my turn to speak.

699
01:20:53,584 --> 01:20:56,417
I don't want to hear it.
Especially not from you.

700
01:20:56,709 --> 01:21:00,584
Of course. It's like hearing
your own conscience.

701
01:21:00,876 --> 01:21:03,042
But I don't want to make reproaches.

702
01:21:03,334 --> 01:21:06,459
Did you forget I'm your friend
in spite of everything?

703
01:21:06,751 --> 01:21:10,126
- What has happened with Antonio?
- I don't want to give explanations.

704
01:21:10,501 --> 01:21:13,834
- I can handle it myself.
- It takes a stubborn person.

705
01:21:14,251 --> 01:21:17,667
I just want to help you as if
nothing had happened. Speak!

706
01:21:22,334 --> 01:21:24,542
You can imagine what happened.

707
01:21:25,834 --> 01:21:27,042
He left you.

708
01:21:27,584 --> 01:21:30,709
- I told you so.
- Unfortunately, you were right.

709
01:21:31,667 --> 01:21:34,292
I was blinded by the idea
that he killed for me.

710
01:21:36,876 --> 01:21:38,209
Explain yourself.

711
01:21:39,834 --> 01:21:43,751
He killed her. But only due
to a fortunate mistake.

712
01:21:44,584 --> 01:21:47,376
- He tried to kill me.
- That creep.

713
01:21:48,334 --> 01:21:50,584
How did it happen?
Did he tell you?

714
01:21:51,834 --> 01:21:55,876
He confessed it himself.
He was becoming very bitter.

715
01:21:56,167 --> 01:22:00,084
Forget your sensitivity, try to
grasp what that confession means.

716
01:22:00,376 --> 01:22:03,417
I don't understand.
You changed since you met him.

717
01:22:04,709 --> 01:22:08,376
If he behaved poorly, why not pay
him back with his own medicine?

718
01:22:08,667 --> 01:22:11,751
I mean charge him the harm
done in real, counting money.

719
01:22:12,042 --> 01:22:14,251
After all, it would be a fair pay-back.

720
01:22:15,959 --> 01:22:18,917
I won't use your methods.
Allow me to use mine.

721
01:22:19,667 --> 01:22:24,251
Oh, yours. You are in no condition
of considering any methods.

722
01:22:24,959 --> 01:22:28,001
You have behaved in a childish,
ridiculous way.

723
01:22:28,417 --> 01:22:31,376
And I'm being kind with words.
I could use others.

724
01:22:32,001 --> 01:22:35,376
You walked out on me in Panama
like I was disposable!

725
01:22:35,667 --> 01:22:40,167
Now it turns that you won't take
advantage of a privileged situation.

726
01:22:41,501 --> 01:22:43,626
Nobody said that.

727
01:22:44,126 --> 01:22:47,459
But I claim my right
of doing it my way.

728
01:22:49,251 --> 01:22:52,001
We would be in
unsurpassable circumstances...

729
01:22:52,292 --> 01:22:55,834
...for the creation of a chemical
industrial subsidiary.

730
01:22:56,959 --> 01:23:00,876
The advantages of this perspective
are obvious to anybody.

731
01:23:01,292 --> 01:23:04,959
We'd have access to more raw
material than up to now.

732
01:23:05,251 --> 01:23:08,667
Excuse me, Mr. ITUARTE. There's a lady
who wants to see you.

733
01:23:09,334 --> 01:23:11,001
How you dare interrupt?

734
01:23:11,709 --> 01:23:15,542
I'm sorry, but... she says
she is your fiancé.

735
01:23:22,417 --> 01:23:23,959
Hello, darling.

736
01:23:26,417 --> 01:23:28,292
I'm sorry, I had to see you.

737
01:23:28,917 --> 01:23:34,376
I was at the insurance company.
There is an unacceptable clause.

738
01:23:34,667 --> 01:23:37,709
The company reserves the right
to perform an autopsy on me...

739
01:23:38,001 --> 01:23:40,917
...if it is deemed necessary
to pay in case I should die.

740
01:23:41,709 --> 01:23:43,126
Isn't that hideous?

741
01:23:44,084 --> 01:23:46,209
Or perhaps I misunderstood it?

742
01:23:49,209 --> 01:23:52,292
Aren't you going to introduce me
to your friends?

743
01:23:52,584 --> 01:23:54,042
Gentlemen...

744
01:23:58,417 --> 01:24:01,376
Miss Raquel Serrano,
my fiancé.

745
01:24:01,667 --> 01:24:03,542
Miss, at your service.

746
01:24:03,876 --> 01:24:04,917
- Miss.
- Miss.

747
01:24:05,209 --> 01:24:10,209
It is a pleasure. Forgive my intrusion.
Believe me, it was involuntary.

748
01:24:11,626 --> 01:24:12,834
I was outraged.

749
01:24:13,209 --> 01:24:16,667
I'll go now. You are all invited
to our wedding, of course.

750
01:24:16,959 --> 01:24:17,959
Oh, certainly.

751
01:24:18,251 --> 01:24:20,667
See you, Antonio.
I'll expect you for dinner.

752
01:24:45,334 --> 01:24:48,292
Mr. Antonio in the name
of my associates...

753
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:51,542
...and mine,
our greatest congratulations.

754
01:24:52,501 --> 01:24:55,251
And now, Mr. Villarreal
will read the project...

755
01:24:55,542 --> 01:24:58,834
...presented by Mr. ITUARTE
in regard to the creation...

756
01:24:59,126 --> 01:25:03,709
...of a mercantile corporation.subsidiary
of Industrial Chemical, Limited.

757
01:25:04,626 --> 01:25:07,917
"Project for the creation
of a limited company...

758
01:25:08,251 --> 01:25:11,042
...between Mr. Antonio ITUARTE,
Mr. Rafael..."

759
01:25:11,334 --> 01:25:12,459
Autopsy!

760
01:25:12,751 --> 01:25:15,876
Now she knows my secret,
she will use it to the end.

761
01:25:16,417 --> 01:25:19,709
She will force me to marry her.
I am my wife's murderer.

762
01:25:20,209 --> 01:25:23,917
To marry her! If they exhume
her body they will find evidence.

763
01:25:24,209 --> 01:25:27,667
My wife's murderer.
There is no possible alternative.

764
01:25:28,251 --> 01:25:29,167
Marry.

765
01:25:31,376 --> 01:25:33,751
I declare in the name
of the law and society...

766
01:25:34,042 --> 01:25:36,292
...that you are legally joined
in matrimony...

767
01:25:36,584 --> 01:25:39,459
...with all the rights and prerogatives
granted by law...

768
01:25:39,751 --> 01:25:41,459
...and the obligations it implies.

769
01:28:42,167 --> 01:28:45,001
Why do all my orders
seem to upset you?

770
01:28:45,626 --> 01:28:47,001
I obey them, madam.

771
01:28:47,584 --> 01:28:49,501
Yes, but against your will.

772
01:28:49,834 --> 01:28:52,084
Tell me what's wrong.
I'm listening.

773
01:28:53,459 --> 01:28:56,417
I wish I had told you
before you asked.

774
01:28:57,084 --> 01:29:01,459
You have tried to obliterate Miss
Elena's memory from this house.

775
01:29:02,209 --> 01:29:04,501
She is only a shadow now,
but...

776
01:29:05,042 --> 01:29:09,209
...it is stronger than you,
and will win in the end.

777
01:29:10,126 --> 01:29:11,626
You mustn't forget it.

778
01:29:12,667 --> 01:29:14,126
That is all.

779
01:29:22,417 --> 01:29:24,084
Mrs. ITUARTE.

780
01:29:34,001 --> 01:29:36,334
The perfect frame
for a work of art.

781
01:29:36,751 --> 01:29:38,084
More than a goddess.

782
01:29:38,501 --> 01:29:41,251
Now you can say
that you're at the peak.

783
01:29:41,542 --> 01:29:46,376
Beauty, luxury, fortune.
What else can you ask of life?

784
01:29:47,459 --> 01:29:49,876
That's what it comes
down to for you.

785
01:29:50,167 --> 01:29:53,417
What else can it come down to?
I am acquainted with life.

786
01:29:53,709 --> 01:29:56,292
Demetrio made a sculpture
of you. I made more.

787
01:29:56,834 --> 01:30:01,126
I made a woman.
You are my best piece.

788
01:30:01,959 --> 01:30:03,959
I sculpt living flesh.

789
01:30:05,459 --> 01:30:06,709
But then...

790
01:30:07,084 --> 01:30:09,751
...that's not what
I wanted to discuss with you.

791
01:30:10,042 --> 01:30:11,709
Although I am very modest...

792
01:30:12,001 --> 01:30:15,084
...even a man like myself
needs certain fees.

793
01:30:15,709 --> 01:30:20,876
Could you provide me with, say,
one hundred thousand pesos?

794
01:30:21,292 --> 01:30:25,251
That would solve everything,
including my silence.

795
01:30:25,667 --> 01:30:27,751
Try to understand my position.

796
01:30:29,167 --> 01:30:34,001
Mrs. ITUARTE has the word.
I am listening eagerly.

797
01:30:34,626 --> 01:30:39,209
In that tone, Nacho. I don't know how
to explain, but things have changed.

798
01:30:39,876 --> 01:30:43,251
- Oh, I can tell, I can tell.
- Ask me for anything but money.

799
01:30:43,667 --> 01:30:46,876
I don't want to be a vulgar
crook in Antonio's eyes.

800
01:30:47,167 --> 01:30:48,709
He would not understand.

801
01:30:49,042 --> 01:30:51,542
I see you have changed,
and I congratulate you.

802
01:30:51,834 --> 01:30:55,876
But although you consider your
husband's crime a declaration of love...

803
01:30:56,167 --> 01:30:58,209
...for me it is still a blank check.

804
01:30:58,876 --> 01:31:01,084
The facts are brutal, but...

805
01:31:01,376 --> 01:31:02,917
...they are the facts.

806
01:31:03,251 --> 01:31:06,417
I know your pride is hurt.
I've told you it isn't my fault.

807
01:31:06,709 --> 01:31:08,584
If you want vengeance, go ahead.

808
01:31:08,876 --> 01:31:12,542
I am determined to everything,
I have my own weapons.

809
01:31:14,042 --> 01:31:15,334
All right.

810
01:31:17,417 --> 01:31:21,501
- Is this your way of ending it?
- Yes, this is my way of ending it.

811
01:33:28,126 --> 01:33:32,834
Speak Raquel, tell me everything.
Take me out of this horrible nightmare.

812
01:33:33,126 --> 01:33:36,126
It was more than that, Antonio.
Worse than hell...

813
01:33:36,417 --> 01:33:39,709
...was the risk of you
having a bad image of me.

814
01:33:40,042 --> 01:33:42,001
But, when you went to say
goodbye to me...

815
01:33:42,334 --> 01:33:44,751
...I realized in an instant
that you loved me.

816
01:33:45,042 --> 01:33:47,042
That you had never
stopped loving me.

817
01:33:47,334 --> 01:33:50,334
And giving up that wonderful
truth was impossible.

818
01:33:51,042 --> 01:33:54,709
I was about to believe that you
would never utter these words.

819
01:33:57,584 --> 01:34:01,126
It is clear that we are united
by something indestructible.

820
01:34:01,417 --> 01:34:05,626
Something beyond ourselves.
We cannot turn back now, Raquel.

821
01:34:05,917 --> 01:34:09,542
We shall go together to salvation
or to death.

822
01:34:10,459 --> 01:34:13,292
I will help you dissipate
the shadows that bind you.

823
01:34:13,584 --> 01:34:17,834
As terrible as our sin may be
we have a right to our piece of heaven.

824
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:30,667
Mr. and Mrs. Antonio ITUARTE.

825
01:34:30,959 --> 01:34:33,667
Upon your arrival in New York
your funds will be available.

826
01:34:33,959 --> 01:34:36,709
- Thank you, counselor.
- Have a good trip.

827
01:34:37,126 --> 01:34:38,792
- Mr. Antonio ITUARTE?
- Yes.

828
01:34:39,084 --> 01:34:42,126
You cannot leave the city,
there is a warrant.

829
01:34:42,417 --> 01:34:44,917
How is that? I am his lawyer.
Please explain.

830
01:34:45,209 --> 01:34:48,292
On grounds of murdering
his first wife.

831
01:34:48,584 --> 01:34:50,084
That is insane! Calm down.

832
01:34:50,376 --> 01:34:53,542
I will immediately apply
a recourse and post bail.

833
01:34:53,834 --> 01:34:56,334
It's a maneuver based on interest.

834
01:34:56,792 --> 01:35:00,209
It is not so easy to get rid of
a willing shadow.

835
01:35:00,501 --> 01:35:03,667
- What did you say?
- Nothing. I was thinking of stalking you.

836
01:35:03,959 --> 01:35:07,501
You may rest assured that everything
will be settled satisfactorily.

837
01:35:11,167 --> 01:35:13,584
Nothing matters if we are together.

838
01:35:14,459 --> 01:35:17,001
ANTONIO ITUARTE IS ACCUSED
OF MURDER

839
01:35:17,292 --> 01:35:20,292
HE POISONED HIS FIRST WIFE

840
01:35:25,501 --> 01:35:29,334
ANTONIO ITUARTE PRISONER

841
01:35:35,542 --> 01:35:37,334
I swear he is innocent!

842
01:35:37,626 --> 01:35:40,667
Can you give us objective
information on his behalf?

843
01:35:40,959 --> 01:35:42,667
Material facts; no.

844
01:35:42,959 --> 01:35:46,251
Like I can't prove that you
are a murderer either, Officer.

845
01:35:46,917 --> 01:35:48,459
Antonio did not kill.

846
01:35:48,876 --> 01:35:51,834
Nobody who truly loves
could be a criminal.

847
01:35:53,459 --> 01:35:58,167
Your words couldn't be more touching
but they are completely worthless.

848
01:35:58,501 --> 01:36:00,584
I ask you to strike her statement...

849
01:36:00,876 --> 01:36:04,709
...due to lack of grounds,
from the offender's wife.

850
01:36:05,042 --> 01:36:07,584
In any case, she could turn
out to be an accomplice...

851
01:36:08,001 --> 01:36:10,501
...if I can prove it, as I hope I will.

852
01:36:10,834 --> 01:36:13,459
I wouldn't care if I were.
He is innocent!

853
01:36:14,209 --> 01:36:17,542
Based on the chargers, I ask
the body to be exhumed...

854
01:36:17,834 --> 01:36:19,917
...and an autopsy to be performed.

855
01:36:23,917 --> 01:36:28,626
TODAY WE WILL KNOW
THE RESULT OF THE AUTOPSY

856
01:37:15,042 --> 01:37:18,626
This document ratifies
Dr. Vidaurri's certificate.

857
01:37:19,417 --> 01:37:22,292
"The forensic doctors commissioned
by the District Attorney...

858
01:37:22,584 --> 01:37:24,751
...render the following statement:

859
01:37:25,626 --> 01:37:26,709
One:

860
01:37:27,001 --> 01:37:31,542
No evidence at all was found
that Mrs. ITUARTE was poisoned.

861
01:37:32,501 --> 01:37:33,459
Two:

862
01:37:33,751 --> 01:37:36,584
Cardiac collateral
hypertrophy was found.

863
01:37:37,209 --> 01:37:38,334
And three:

864
01:37:38,626 --> 01:37:41,501
Mrs. Elena G. ITUARTE
died of a sudden rupture...

865
01:37:41,792 --> 01:37:43,917
...of an aortic aneurysm."

866
01:37:47,126 --> 01:37:50,959
In order to confirm the facts,
I'd like to call one last testimony.

867
01:37:51,251 --> 01:37:52,167
Granted.

868
01:38:23,084 --> 01:38:26,584
Although the doctor forbade it,
she joined the party downstairs.

869
01:38:26,917 --> 01:38:28,792
When all the guests parted...

870
01:38:29,209 --> 01:38:33,709
...except for Mrs. Raquel and
her companion; Mr. Antonio,...

871
01:38:34,126 --> 01:38:38,959
...has been called by Dr. Vidaurri,
and my Miss Elena...

872
01:38:39,251 --> 01:38:42,876
...in a sudden manner and
seemed to be very nervous.

873
01:38:43,834 --> 01:38:45,042
Very nervous.

874
01:38:46,792 --> 01:38:50,209
Your mission is over in this house.
You are dismissed.

875
01:38:52,334 --> 01:38:54,126
Let us go, Demetrio!

876
01:38:56,042 --> 01:38:58,042
Good night, madam.

877
01:39:10,459 --> 01:39:13,667
It looked like she was
about to faint again.

878
01:39:13,959 --> 01:39:17,542
As if she didn't have the
strength to hold on to it...

879
01:39:17,834 --> 01:39:21,084
...the content of her glass
spilt on the carpet.

880
01:39:30,959 --> 01:39:32,167
Esteban.

881
01:39:33,251 --> 01:39:34,709
Call my husband.

882
01:39:37,501 --> 01:39:40,792
I didn't have to call him,
he arrived at that moment.

883
01:39:41,209 --> 01:39:44,626
Naturally, I retired
as not to be indiscreet.

884
01:40:30,626 --> 01:40:31,667
Antonio!

885
01:40:35,876 --> 01:40:37,917
You are free now, Antonio.

886
01:40:39,167 --> 01:40:41,251
Faith in our love
has saved us.

887
01:40:41,542 --> 01:40:43,751
The strength of our love
produced a miracle.

888
01:40:44,292 --> 01:40:47,042
You didn't kill her,
Antonio, no.

889
01:40:47,459 --> 01:40:49,542
She died her own death.

890
01:40:49,959 --> 01:40:52,959
No shadow will ever come
between us. Never.

891
01:40:53,667 --> 01:40:56,459
Nobody has been able
to untie us!

892
01:40:57,626 --> 01:41:00,792
The night is gone forever,
Antonio.

893
01:41:10,292 --> 01:41:11,709
Antonio!

894
01:41:12,917 --> 01:41:14,459
Antonio!

895
01:41:17,709 --> 01:41:19,792
Antonio!

896
01:42:06,042 --> 01:42:08,584
The End

1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,170
NARRATOR:
A fiery object

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,796
crashes into the Earth

3
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:08,842
and ignites the modern UFO era.

4
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,136
It would become
the absolute touchstone event

5
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:13,347
and the best‐known event
in the world

6
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:16,016
connecting our reality
to the E. T. phenomenon.

7
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,352
NARRATOR:
For more than seven decades,

8
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:21,188
the Army has denied
what it initially reported‐‐

9
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:24,358
that it had recovered
a flying disc.

10
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:28,528
But could evidence
of such an event still exist?

11
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:31,031
‐(beeping)
‐Oh, my God.
There is something there,

12
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,950
and we need to dig it up.

13
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,202
NARRATOR:
Are there remnants
of alien technology

14
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,871
scattered
in the New Mexico desert?

15
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,040
LINDA MOULTON HOWE:
I think he's holding something

16
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,167
made by another intelligence.

17
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,545
I have never, ever seen
anything like this.

18
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,046
NARRATOR:
And could materials

19
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,383
already recovered
soon reveal the truth

20
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:52,719
about an extraterrestrial
presence on Earth?

21
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,930
There's something big
going on here.

22
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,932
I'm getting chills
because we've got some elements

23
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:59,017
that are showing up‐‐
they shouldn't be there.

24
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:01,186
GIORGIO A. TSOUKALOS:
If the evidence has not yet been

25
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:04,398
uncovered,
that does not mean the evidence

26
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:05,691
is not there.

27
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,279
NARRATOR:
There is a doorway

28
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:13,073
in the universe.

29
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,076
Beyond it is
the promise of truth.

30
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,788
It demands
we question everything

31
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:22,082
we have ever been taught.

32
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:26,420
The evidence is all around us.

33
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,881
The future is
right before our eyes.

34
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:32,551
We are not alone.

35
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:36,138
We have never <i>been</i> alone.

36
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,939
NARRATOR:
Los Angeles, California.

37
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,775
October 2019.

38
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:52,571
Ancient astronaut theorist
Giorgio Tsoukalos...

39
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,573
‐Hey, Linda.
‐...is meeting up

40
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,742
with investigative journalist
Linda Moulton Howe

41
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:58,827
at a secure storage facility.

42
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,829
‐All right, let's do it.
‐Let's go.

43
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,415
NARRATOR:
For more than two decades,

44
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:07,127
Linda has been in possession of
highly unusual metal fragments

45
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,755
given to her
by someone who claims

46
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:13,300
they were extracted
from an extraterrestrial craft.

47
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,135
‐Man, this is some door.
‐(beep)

48
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,595
(Tsoukalos chuckles)

49
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:18,430
Okay.

50
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,599
Well, over the years,

51
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,601
I've learned that this is really

52
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:23,977
‐pretty valuable.
‐Right.

53
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,979
And that I better keep it
in something

54
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,357
‐like a safety deposit box.
‐Right.

55
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:30,817
NARRATOR:
In recent months,

56
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,987
the United States Army
has taken an interest

57
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,616
in doing its own examination
of these materials.

58
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:41,495
Linda is eager to show Giorgio
just what it is

59
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:44,164
that has caught
the Army's attention.

60
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:48,210
Here is where the magic
bismuth magnesium zinc resides.

61
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,837
There it is,
inside the magic box.

62
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:54,424
Yeah. Here, I'll take it
over here and show it to you.

63
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:01,139
I have found,

64
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,350
since having this

65
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,185
in 1996

66
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,355
and evolving with research, that

67
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,691
it has become now so valuable.

68
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,783
What am I looking at, Linda?
What is this?

69
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,785
Well, here is...

70
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,121
You see all these layers?

71
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:27,624
‐Yeah.
‐When you go to a scanning

72
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,876
‐electron microscope...
‐Huh.

73
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,586
...and you see that the black,

74
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:34,881
the black side‐‐
it's pure bismuth,

75
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,551
and it's one to four microns,
which is about

76
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,553
half the size of a blood cell,

77
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,514
and then it's alternating
just like a torte cake.

78
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,558
‐TSOUKALOS: Yeah.
‐And the top silver‐‐

79
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,893
that's the magnesium‐zinc alloy.

80
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,520
‐Okay.
‐So,

81
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,856
layer by layer by layer
in microns.

82
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,899
TSOUKALOS:
It's almost
as if it's reflective, too.

83
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,026
HOWE:
Yes, and when you get it

84
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,571
in the sun,
it looks like a snowfield.

85
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,699
And that's the magnesium zinc.

86
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,909
NARRATOR:
In addition
to this layered material,

87
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,663
Linda also has
an unusual piece of aluminum.

88
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,707
HOWE:
As I understand

89
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:12,127
from a physicist, it is this

90
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:16,423
pure aluminum,
99.5% pure aluminum.

91
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,384
TSOUKALOS:
As far as I know,
we can't produce 99 point...

92
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,678
I mean, this is incredibly pure.

93
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:25,056
So where were these pieces
allegedly found?

94
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:28,226
HOWE:
These came out of White Sands

95
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,854
in New Mexico,
outside of Roswell.

96
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:34,649
Is there a connection
to Roswell with this piece?

97
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:39,237
NARRATOR:
In July of 1947,

98
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,615
an unidentified flying object

99
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,408
crashed to Earth in the desert

100
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,952
just outside
Roswell, New Mexico.

101
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:50,624
It is today the most famous
UFO event on record,

102
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,210
in part
because it was the Army itself

103
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,255
that reported the craft
as a flying disc.

104
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:01,092
BILL BIRNES:
July 8 and 9,
the newspaper headlines‐‐

105
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:04,471
"Army Captures Flying Disc
Outside of Roswell."

106
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,307
How did the newspaper get
that story? Walter Haut.

107
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,143
He was the official
public information officer

108
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,396
at the Roswell 509th, who gave
the story to the newspaper.

109
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,816
NARRATOR:
But the military

110
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,984
quickly walked back its story.

111
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,655
Within days,
the mysterious Roswell UFO

112
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:25,492
was given an earthly origin,
when the government claimed

113
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,662
that the downed craft was merely
a weather balloon.

114
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,080
They changed it and said

115
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,957
it was a weather balloon
and everything else.

116
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:33,333
They said they took it

117
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,293
to Wright‐Patterson
Air Force Base in Ohio.

118
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,462
RICHARD DOLAN:
When you really think
about this,

119
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,674
why on earth would
anyone send any kind

120
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:45,512
of weather balloon to Wright
Field for technical analysis?

121
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,264
None of it makes any sense
whatsoever,

122
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:50,100
unless that material
was much more exotic

123
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,102
and much more
scientifically interesting

124
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,812
than just a mere balloon.

125
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,689
DAVID CHILDRESS:
When you look

126
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,190
at the whole Roswell incident,

127
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,360
it seems to be a recovery that

128
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,488
was very much
a scrambled ad hoc thing.

129
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:07,367
And, in fact, witnesses had been
to the crash site

130
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,286
before the military got there.

131
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:13,832
So in the chaos of trying
to clean up this crash site,

132
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:17,252
you have to wonder that whether
they would really get it all.

133
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,880
Where would this material

134
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,631
actually go?

135
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,675
And would they have left
some of it behind,

136
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,343
just by accident?

137
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:29,931
NARRATOR:
In April 2011,

138
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,684
the FBI released thousands
of files

139
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:35,270
as part of its online FBI vault,

140
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,023
including a 1950 briefing

141
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,358
to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover

142
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,360
regarding informant information

143
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,279
about three flying saucers

144
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,573
that were recovered
in New Mexico.

145
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,575
Many researchers believe

146
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,036
this corroborates
long‐standing rumors

147
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:54,122
that the Roswell incident
involved not one

148
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:57,375
but three crashed UFOs.

149
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,420
And there were numerous
other incidents reported

150
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,589
during that time period
in the area

151
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,216
of Roswell
and White Sands Proving Ground

152
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:08,011
that remain mostly unknown.

153
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:11,556
You look at where the world
today, when they think

154
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,475
of a UFO crash,
they think of Roswell.

155
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:16,061
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐Certainly there
have been crashes

156
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,313
in New Mexico
outside of Roswell.

157
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:22,317
We know that there were a lot
of UFO crashes going

158
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:26,488
from the '40... like,
'47, '48, '49, and so forth.

159
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:29,240
How did you come into possession
of these pieces?

160
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,953
Well, I'll never forget
the day that Art Bell called me,

161
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:37,791
and he said,
"Linda, I received a box

162
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,461
with a letter, and there's
some metal pieces in here."

163
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,130
He said,
"I think they're aluminum,

164
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,634
but I want you
to start investigating."

165
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:51,054
That would have been in 1996,
that spring.

166
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:56,142
NARRATOR:
Art Bell was the founder

167
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,186
and original host
of the long‐running,

168
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:01,940
paranormal‐themed radio program
<i>Coast to Coast AM.</i>

169
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,944
In 1996, he and Linda began

170
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,946
to receive shipments in the mail

171
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:11,449
of small metallic fragments.

172
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,993
We started getting two shipments

173
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,788
coming from a man
who identified himself

174
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:20,125
in a series
of five typed letters.

175
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,168
And he said
he was an Army sergeant,

176
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,505
that his grandfather had died
in 1974,

177
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:29,551
and had left a box
that had a diary and metals.

178
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,636
And the Army sergeant said,

179
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:35,181
"I want you to have this
and see what you can find out."

180
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,517
NARRATOR:
The letters detail

181
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,687
how the grandfather extracted
the metallic items

182
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,313
from a wedge‐shaped craft

183
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,691
while working as a member
of a recovery crew

184
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:49,654
between Roswell and White Sands
Proving Ground in 1948.

185
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:53,533
Art Bell turned over these
mysterious fragments and letters

186
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,536
to Linda Moulton Howe
for further study.

187
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,539
In June of 1996,

188
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,833
Linda commissioned
university researchers

189
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,169
to use
a scanning electron microscope

190
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:07,630
and a technique known as "X‐ray
fluorescence spectrometry"

191
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,508
to analyze the samples.

192
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:14,304
The analysis revealed
alternating microscopic layers

193
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:17,849
of the metals bismuth,
magnesium and zinc

194
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,560
only microns thick,

195
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,898
a combination that baffles
exotic metal experts.

196
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:29,027
GEORGE KNAPP:
I think we've got technology
that we didn't make.

197
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,695
A lot of people
have come forward

198
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,990
with bits and pieces
of the same tale.

199
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,534
We are presently analyzing
metamaterials

200
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,203
that we did not make,

201
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:41,039
that's created in a way
that is beyond our technology.

202
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,918
TSOUKALOS:
Are there more pieces
of these items?

203
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,420
Well, for the last,
uh, 15 years,

204
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,256
I had a combination
of another piece

205
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,759
of the bismuth magnesium zinc

206
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,596
and another smaller piece
of the aluminum.

207
00:09:56,596 --> 00:10:00,767
So, the pair that I had before
is now involved

208
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,602
with military testing.

209
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:06,064
NARRATOR:
In 2019,

210
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,441
Linda handed over
additional samples

211
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,777
of the exotic metals
for examination

212
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,737
by the United States Army.

213
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:16,074
As far as Linda is concerned,

214
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:19,369
even though the fragments were
allegedly taken from a craft

215
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,747
that was in the Army's
possession in 1948,

216
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,291
there are likely
only a handful of people

217
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,627
who are aware of its existence.

218
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:31,714
She is hopeful that the
examination of her materials

219
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,759
will prove that they were not
manufactured on Earth,

220
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:38,179
and perhaps those who know
what really happened at Roswell

221
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,640
will finally reveal
both the truth

222
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,601
and what they recovered
to the public.

223
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:48,148
Do you have any new leads
that maybe happened recently

224
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:51,568
of someone
that has found other material?

225
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:55,697
Well, there is a geologist
down in Roswell,

226
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:58,116
and he has sent me e‐mails
saying

227
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,618
that he's got exotic metals

228
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,954
and all of these materials.

229
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:05,623
And I think
we could go down there,

230
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,625
see what he has found so far,

231
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,795
and maybe go out with him
and explore ourselves.

232
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,589
Awesome. Let's go.

Major Jesse Marcel,

245
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:54,881
the head intelligence officer
at Roswell Army Air Field,

246
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,091
travels to Fort Worth, Texas,

about the crash
of a flying saucer at Roswell,

255
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,911
except Roger Ramey says
to Jesse Marcel,

256
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,080
"Could you just go
in the map room for a second?

257
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,957
I want to arrange some stuff
out here."

258
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:33,086
The story from Jesse Marcel
and from the photographer

259
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,756
is that the real wreckage
had been spirited away.

260
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,758
"Hold up something.

261
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,761
"Get some Reynolds Wrap out‐‐
off‐off the fish in your freezer

and hold it up and say that's
what you found, not a disc,"

263

which is exactly what they did.

For UFO researchers,

266
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,858
evidence that
the actual wreckage from Roswell

267
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,194
was indeed replaced
with a weather balloon

268
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,989
can be found
within the notorious photograph,

269
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:05,785
along with clues as to what was
being hidden from the public.

270
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,829
When General Roger Ramey was,

271
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:10,748
uh, posing for photographs
with Jesse Marcel,

272
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,208
in the aftermath of all this,

273
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,295
you can see him very clearly
holding a piece of paper.

274
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:18,298
POPE:
General Ramey had a document
in his hands,

275
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,508
the so‐called Ramey Memo.

276
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,344
Modern forensic
document analysis

277
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,138
and photographic enhancement

278
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:29,309
has enabled some researchers
to zoom in on this

279
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:33,313
and to clarify at least
some portions of the text.

280
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:36,107
What it tells us is astounding.

281
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:41,154
Some of the phrases in the memo
are "victims of the wreck"

282
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:44,157
and "disc which we will ship."

283
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,658
So, clearly,

284
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,536
if the official story is true,

285
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,329
well, this makes no sense.

286
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,791
No, clearly, something more
than just a weather balloon

287
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,209
was involved here,

288
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:58,796
and the memo might just be
the smoking gun.

289
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:02,800
NARRATOR:
As far as Roswell researchers
are concerned,

290
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,094
the memo points to a cover‐up,

291
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:08,639
with the downed UFO
and its extraterrestrial crew

292
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,849
being shipped from the base

293
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:13,186
and locked away
from the public eye.

294
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,812
But if true,

295
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,190
might there be fragments
of evidence from the crash

296
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,818
that were small enough
to slip through the cracks?

297
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,528
The question is always, well,

298
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,489
where is the evidence,
where is the evidence?

299
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:27,784
Well, if the evidence
has not yet been uncovered

300
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,660
or dug out of the ground,

301
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,873
that does not mean
the evidence is not there.

to a spot in the desert

307
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,188
just outside Roswell,

308
00:14:57,188 --> 00:15:00,733
very near what is known
as the "skip site."

309
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:04,487
According to eyewitnesses,
one of the three UFOs

310
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:08,908
seen in the sky in July 1947
first crashed to Earth

311
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:13,454
near this location, then was
propelled back into the air,

312
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:18,584
skipping like a stone in a pond
before finally coming to rest.

313
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:22,255
Linda was contacted
by geologist Frank Kimbler,

314
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:25,216
who wants to show her
mysterious metal fragments

315
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:29,053
that he found here
and search the area for more.

316

Linda, this is so exciting.

317
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,766
I have not been here
in a couple of years.

318
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,893
So, I'm really looking forward

‐t‐to meeting Frank.
‐Yeah.

320
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:40,273
Well, I'm glad that we've got
a geologist who's helping,

321
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:43,067
because the geologist
looks at land

322
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,694
and says if there is debris,

323
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:48,823
there's going to be some
kind of a drift with the land.

324
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,784
And, just from what I know,
he has studied

325
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,995
some areas meticulously.

326
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,997

If it's coming apart, it's gonna
leave those pieces behind.

345
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:46,088
And those are the kinds
of pieces that I want to find

346

more than a dozen metal
fragments that he has subjected

349
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:59,310
to scientific testing
and found to be highly unique.

350
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,562
That's what...
We want to go out there and see

351
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,189
‐where you've been getting this.
‐TSOUKALOS: Yeah, I can't wait.

352
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,398
‐Frank.
‐Yeah?

353
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,858
What's inside the case?

354
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,736
Oh, this, this is
the magic right here.

355
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:13,032
This is some of the material
that I have found

356
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:16,869
out here, uh,
using a metal detector.

357
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,287
‐Uh...
‐TSOUKALOS: Interesting.

358
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,164
KIMBLER:
This stuff
is, is very interesting.

359
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,374
It's all twisted and mangled up.

360
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,541
Something that you would expect

361
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,544
to happen from a, uh, a‐a crash

362
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:29,006
is to have metal that's‐that's
compact and twisted.

363
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:34,554
When Professor Kimbler laid out
his box of his pieces of metal,

364
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,430
the first thing that struck me

365
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,726
is these were
tiny, tiny, tiny fragments.

366
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:45,439
Could they possibly be
from wreckage?

367
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,441
These pieces are small, uh,

368
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,902
which is things that the
government would have missed.

369
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,571
‐Uh, yeah.
‐They wouldn't have
been able to find it.

370
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,573
And here's my magic.

371
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,700
Let's get a comparison here.

372
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,244
‐KIMBLER: Oh, look at that.
‐This...

373
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,538
HOWE:
Look at‐‐ it's like a snowfield.

374
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:02,206
After all these years, the‐‐

375
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:06,419
all of the pieces,
they look absolutely pristine.

376
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,421
That's the magnesium zinc side.

377
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,548
KIMBLER:
This has got layers to it,
and that's amazing. That's...

378
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:13,718
‐But I bet you've never seen
anything like this.
‐No.

379
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:16,721
Being an Earth scientist,
being a geologist,

380
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:19,599
I've seen lots of all kinds
of materials that are out there.

381
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,560
I have never, ever seen
anything like this.

382
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,896
This fragment that Linda
is showing me,

383
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,065
it‐‐ that stuff
is absolutely amazing.

384
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,818
I've never seen anything like it
before in my life.

385
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,779
And what's interesting about it
is that it has some layers,

386
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,448
some banding on it.

387
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:38,618
And that banding is very similar
to some of the banding

388
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:41,203
that I found in photomicrographs
of the material

389
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,080
that I have from out here.

390
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,500
I think,
as Giorgio is holding this,

391
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,630
he's holding something made
by another intelligence

392
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,840
from some place
we don't understand.

393
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,177
And this is truly
extraterrestrial.

394
00:18:56,177 --> 00:19:00,640
NARRATOR:
Is it possible that Giorgio
is holding an actual fragment

395
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,476
of an extraterrestrial craft?

396
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:07,063
And if so, could even more
incredible artifacts

397
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:10,399
still remain in the desert
outside Roswell?

398
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:21,369
NARRATOR: Ancient astronaut
theorist Giorgio Tsoukalos

399
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:24,330
and investigative journalist
Linda Moulton Howe

400
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,999
are in an area
outside Roswell, New Mexico

401
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,335
with geologist Frank Kimbler.

402
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,505
I've got one of the, uh, the
infrared pictures right here,

403
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:35,383
that actually is,
it's kind of contrast‐enhanced.

404
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,927
NARRATOR:
As far as Professor Kimbler
is concerned,

405
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,429
if one or more
extraterrestrial crafts

406
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,431
really did crash in the desert,

407
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:46,435
the best place to find
more debris is right here.

408
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:50,564
Right now we are roughly about
maybe two, two and a half miles

409
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,983
from where the object
skipped down,

410
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:56,404
according
to eyewitness accounts.

411
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,447
This is actually the disturbed
area right here,

412
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,949
which is right
where we're going.

413
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:02,702
And it's right where
the eyewitness account

414
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,745
basically says that the craft
left a furrow.

415
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,789
So you can tell
that something went on.

416
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,791
It even looks like
there's a little a gouge mark

417
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,001
that was left by the craft
as it came in.

418
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:14,797
NARRATOR:
The disturbed area that
Professor Kimbler identified

419
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,425
has become known as the "gouge."

420
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:22,680
In 2002, an archaeological dig
was conducted in this area

421
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,516
by the University
of New Mexico, Albuquerque,

422
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:30,563
to search for topographical
evidence of a UFO crash.

423
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,983
KIMBLER:
They found a V‐shaped gouge
that seemed to indicate

424
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:37,570
that something came down
and skated across the ground,

425
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,948
like a typical aircraft
crashing into the ground,

426
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,575
leaving a‐a big furrow there.

427
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:45,411
NARRATOR:
Author Donald Schmitt,
an advisor

428
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:48,914
to the International UFO Museum
& Research Center

429
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:52,251
board of directors,
took part in the excavation.

430
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,836
DONALD SCHMITT:
We flagged that area,

431
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:59,175
did electromagnetic
sensory testing of the sites

432
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:03,471
to sift through possible samples
from the crash.

433
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:08,642
All in an attempt to find
a piece of that missing evidence

434
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,853
that would demonstrate
once and for all

435
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:13,939
that this was something
extraordinary.

436
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,942
NARRATOR:
The dig collected
countless soil samples

437
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,195
from in and around the gouge.

438
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:22,656
But curiously, access to this
wealth of potential evidence

439
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,116
has been restricted

440
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:27,119
by the Bureau of Land Management
ever since.

441
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,955
KIMBLER:
There's 600 pounds of stuff
stored in a vault

442
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:33,459
in the Maxwell Museum
at the University of New Mexico

443
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,504
that nobody has looked at,
and it needs to be looked at.

444
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:38,631
NARRATOR:
Demands by UFO researchers

445
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,216
to be given access

446
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,384
to the contents of the 2002 dig

447
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,720
have fallen on deaf ears.

448
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,931
In the nearly two decades since,

449
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:49,934
the V‐shaped gouge has been
filled in with sediment,

450
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,477
but many believe

451
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:54,063
that if there is more debris
still to be found,

452
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:56,982
it is most likely
to be found here.

453
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,319
We need to get going,
and we need to get out there

454
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,321
so you guys can experience

455
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,572
finding some of this stuff,

456
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,740
‐which is amazing.
‐TSOUKALOS: All right.

457
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,741
Let's go explore.

458
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:10,120
HOWE: So, where do you think's
best here now?

459
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,081
KIMBLER:
We're in the perfect spot.

460
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,874
And we're gonna cover
this whole thing right here.

461
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:17,002
NARRATOR:
Uncovering bits of debris
in this vast desert

462
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,712
is a daunting task,

463
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:23,175
but after nearly a decade
spent combing the entire area,

464
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:26,178
Professor Kimbler has pinpointed
certain hot spots.

465
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:29,431
Some of the artifacts
he brought with him today

466
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,183
were discovered
in this very location

467
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,935
just within the past month.

468
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,604
So, just above the area
of the ground,

469
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:38,357
we're gonna sweep back and forth
like this.

470
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,109
We're gonna cover this

471
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:41,694
side to side,

472
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,696
back and forth,
little by little.

473
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,281
I've been out here

474
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:47,908
six or seven or eight hours
at a whack swinging this thing

475
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,243
till my arms break off.

476
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:51,912
We can, uh, cut across this way.

477
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,706
HOWE:
You're waiting for that beep.

478
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:56,250
We're looking off in‐in
this general direction out here.

479
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,127
The craft basically

480
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,920
either had some kind
of mechanical failure

481
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,547
or something blew up.

482
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:04,675
NARRATOR:
Professor Kimbler scans
the area along the gouge,

483
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:07,469
meticulously covering
every inch.

484
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,889
After nearly two hours,

485
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,600
he has not detected
any metal objects.

486
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,226
Giorgio,
my arm is about to break off,

487
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,437
and I'm kind of hoping
that you just might have

488
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:19,398
‐a little bit
better luck than me doing this.
‐Sure. Let's see.

489
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,192
‐You saw what I was doing,
it's already fired up.
‐Yep. Okay.

490
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,153
And I'm gonna let you
swing this. And we can just...

491
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:25,946
‐Let's see if it's working.
‐(beeping)

492
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,239
‐There you go,
it's working perfect.
‐Great. Perfect. Excellent.

493
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,283
Maybe you'll be able to...

494
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:32,244
‐to get the magic
flowing on this.
‐Mm‐hmm.

495
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,914
I think we need to head up
right over here because

496
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,332
this is right
at the base of the hill

497
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:38,292
and there's
a bunch of disturbed rocks.

498
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:39,919
Might be a good place to, uh,

499
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,670
‐to capture material
that has run off.
‐Okay.

500
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,881
‐(beeping)
‐It's also...
‐Oh!

501
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:47,259
NARRATOR:
Within just a few minutes of
taking over the metal detecting,

502
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,594
Giorgio gets a hit.

503
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:49,803
KIMBLER:
I heard something.

504
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:50,804
TSOUKALOS:
Yeah.

505
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,806
‐(beeping)
‐There is something.

506
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,808
KIMBLER:
Oh, my God.

507
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:57,686
(beeping continues)

508
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,606
KIMBLER:
There is something there
and we need to dig it up.

509
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:02,441
‐Let me help you find it.
‐Okay.

510
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,276
It's right here somewhere.

511
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,694
‐We'll find it.
‐It's right here.

512
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:08,155
‐We will find it.
‐(beeping)

513
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,448
KIMBLER:
You're on top of it.

514
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,116
‐You're right there.
‐Right there.

515
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:14,495
(beeping)

516
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:16,664
See if it's there.

517
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:18,123
It's in my hand.

518
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,166
Wow.

519
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,418
Now comes the hard part.

520
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:24,004
‐It's a‐a piece of wire.
‐(Tsoukalos and Howe laughing)

521
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,464
All right. Okay.

522
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:28,008
‐A tiny little piece of wire.
‐Little wire.

523
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:30,302
KIMBLER:
We're gonna keep it. We're gonna
take it and have it analyzed

524
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,013
because maybe it's got
something in it that's weird.

525
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,765
Let's still investigate this.

526
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:36,892
KIMBLER:
We need to take it
and‐and have it tested.

527
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:40,062
NARRATOR:
Giorgio hands off
the metal detector to Linda,

528
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:41,730
who continues along the gouge.

529
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,817
Just a few feet from
where Giorgio detected

530
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,819
‐a piece of wire...
‐(beeping)
‐Oh.

531
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,320
...they get another hit.

532
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,072
(beeping)

533
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,785
‐All right. Oh.
‐Pick up your, uh,
your bracelet, too.

534
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:57,162
I tell you what,
let's, um, dump it,

535
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,415
dump it into this hand,
right here.

536
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:00,833
There we go.

537
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,002
It's another piece of wire.

538
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,670
TSOUKALOS:
This is strange‐looking, though.

539
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:08,424
‐Why is it so
twisted and mangled?
‐I have no idea.

540
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:11,593
TSOUKALOS:
You said that
if there was debris,

541
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,554
this would be one of the places

542
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:15,889
because of the geographic, uh...

543
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,474
‐terrain right here.
‐It's, it's runoff,

544
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:20,978
and this is what I've used time
and time again to find stuff.

545
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:23,981
NARRATOR:
As far as Giorgio and Linda
are concerned,

546
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:27,192
any metal objects found in
the so‐called "gouge" area

547
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,736
are worth examining.

548
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:32,865
Is it possible that these
bits of wire represent debris

549
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:37,536
from the 1947 crash that was
overlooked by the military?

550
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:48,797
NARRATOR:
Sergeant Melvin E. Brown,
who served in

551
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:53,177
the 509th Atomic Bomb Squadron
for the U. S. Army Air Force,

552
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:56,680
lies on his deathbed
at a local hospital.

553
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,142
With his dying words,
Brown reveals to his family

554
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:03,604
a secret that he has kept hidden
for nearly 40 years‐‐

555
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:08,609
a secret about
what he saw in 1947

556
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:11,528
when he was stationed
in Roswell, New Mexico.

557
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:17,159
Sergeant Melvin Brown is another
key player in all of this.

558
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:21,830
He was rounded up
by higher command

559
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,832
in the aftermath of the crash.

560
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,585
He was essentially
put on guard duty.

561
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:31,882
And, intriguingly, there were
some low flatbed lorries

562
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:33,884
with tarpaulins over them.

563
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:37,346
SCHMITT:
The first opportunity he got,

564
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,681
he peeked inside
the back of the truck.

565
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,184
And there, under a canvas tarp,

566
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,770
were two of the bodies
from the crash site.

567
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:50,192
When he was on his deathbed,
he brought up Roswell.

568
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:53,320
Days before he passed away,
he talked about,

569
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,698
"It was not a weather balloon.
It wasn't from here.

570
00:26:56,698 --> 00:27:02,496
And I saw two of the bodies,
and they were not human."

571
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:06,667
POPE:
Deathbed testimony is a critical
part of the Roswell story.

572
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,168
There are several.

573
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,545
There are many reasons

574
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:12,589
why some of the witnesses
stayed quiet for so long:

575
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,883
fear, threats.

576
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,635
All of this plays a part.

577
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,723
NARRATOR:
Many UFO researchers
believe that,

578
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,851
much like these
deathbed testimonies,

579
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:27,521
it is only a matter of time
before physical evidence

580
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:31,066
of a crashed extraterrestrial
craft finally surfaces.

581
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,402
And some even suggest

582
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:36,905
that such evidence
has already been recovered.

583
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,244
HOWE:
Here it is, right here.

584
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:45,831
NARRATOR:
One day after uncovering wires
near the Roswell skip site,

585
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:49,167
Giorgio Tsoukalos and
Linda Moulton Howe have traveled

586
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,419
to Theta Plate Lab,

587
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:52,796
where they are met
by owner Aaron Velasquez.

588
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,047
HOWE:
Hi.

589
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,507
It's good to finally meet you.

590
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,009
‐Welcome.
‐Hello.

591
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,303
NARRATOR:
Geologist Frank Kimbler
arrived earlier with

592
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:01,346
the metal fragments
he has collected

593
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,598
over the past eight years

594
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:05,517
in and around
the Roswell crash site.

595
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,270
Hey, Frank.
Good to see you again.

596
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,272
‐It's good to see you guys.
We're‐we're good.
‐Good to see you again.

597
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:12,107
‐Ready for some testing?
‐We're ready for some testing.

598
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,317
This is the exciting part.

599
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:14,610
‐Excellent.
‐I've been waiting for this.

600
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,737
NARRATOR:
Professor Kimbler's fragments

601
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:18,864
will be scientifically tested,

602
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:22,242
along with the wires they found
in the desert just yesterday

603
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:25,537
to determine
their elemental makeup.

604
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,539
VELASQUEZ:
So, we're gonna use
this machine.

605
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,625
It's an X‐ray
florescence machine.

606
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,668
It can do
materials identification,

607
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:34,087
so we're gonna hit it
with an X‐ray beam

608
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,881
and it'll tell us
what it can tell us.

609
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:39,551
So, it has the ability
to show us the elements that are

610
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,304
in this within a certain range,
is that right?

611
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:43,722
‐VELASQUEZ: Correct, correct.
‐Mm‐hmm.

612
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,142
Okay, here we go.

613
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:50,270
So, we're seeing
a big peak here.

614
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,564
This is iron. All right.

615
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,691
What else seems like a match?

616
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,902
Well...

617
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,236
Selenium.

618
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,613
KIMBLER:
What in the world?

619
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:02,699
Yeah, that‐that is
exactly my reaction.

620
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,660
‐Yeah.
‐What is selenium
doing with that?

621
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:08,747
KIMBLER:
I know that selenium is used
in the electronics industry

622
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,123
for semiconductors.

623
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,583
Let's go ahead and, uh,

624
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,877
take a look at
the second wire, please.

625
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:20,092
‐That there is... selenium.
‐This is selenium.

626
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:22,135
‐Still?
‐VELASQUEZ: Yeah.

627
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,096
NARRATOR:
The makeup of
the second wire fragment

628
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:27,516
appears to be nearly identical
to the first.

629
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:31,103
Might the presence of selenium,
a semiconductor,

630
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:34,439
indicate that they were part of
an electronic device?

631
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:39,111
‐KIMBLER: This one.
‐VELASQUEZ: Okay.

632
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:42,364
NARRATOR:
Frank has also brought with him
a number of metal pieces

633
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:44,992
that he has gathered
in the same area over the years,

634
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:46,952
and has yet to test.

635
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:52,165
So, it looks like
it's a match for iron.

636
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,292
But I'm curious about
that little shoulder.

637
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,546
Copper.

638
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:58,714
‐KIMBLER: Okay.
‐Copper...

639
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:00,674
So, I mean,
it's dead‐on copper match.

640
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:03,010
‐KIMBLER: So, we know we've got
some copper in there.
‐Mm‐hmm.

641
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,469
And then this stuff over here...

642
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:09,766
I'd call it a good match
for zirconium.

643
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:10,809
KIMBLER:
For zirconium?

644
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,353
‐Wow.
‐Yeah.

645
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,605
That would be unusual.

646
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,817
VELASQUEZ:
This is a good match
for molybdenum.

647
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:23,363
KIMBLER:
So, now we've got not only

648
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,782
zirconium in there,
but we have molybdenum.

649
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:28,994
And those are considered
impurities, Giorgio,

650
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:30,746
but they shouldn't be there.

651
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:34,207
But what does that mean when
you say it shouldn't be there?

652
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:37,210
KIMBLER:
Because that's unusual
for any alloys

653
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,587
that I've looked at previously.

654
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:41,048
It's part of
our high‐tech industry.

655
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:42,382
VELASQUEZ:
It's weird for me, too.

656
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:43,925
So, you'd see molybdenum
in a stainless steel,

657
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,677
but not an iron copper alloy.

658
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:46,970
‐KIMBLER: Yeah.
‐VELASQUEZ: Yeah.

659
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,513
‐KIMBLER: I agree with that.
‐TSOUKALOS: Okay.

660
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,891
‐I like it.
‐And zirconium has been found

661
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:55,771
in some cases
where material has been tested

662
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:58,690
and it was somehow
related to a crash.

663
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,650
‐I've run across that myself.
‐Zirconium.

664
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:05,864
NARRATOR:
In 2009, a Freedom of
Information Act request

665
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,824
brought to light
a research study

666
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:12,704
conducted at Wright‐Patterson
Air Force Base in 1949,

667
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:16,583
the site in Ohio where the
wreckage from Roswell was taken.

668
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,127
According to released documents,

669
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,421
metallurgists discovered
zirconium

670
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,882
while examining pieces of
strange metal

671
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,009
recovered in
the New Mexico desert.

672
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:32,224
Is this a piece that you found
where we were walking around?

673
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,767
Absolutely.

674
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:35,811
In fact, if we could bring
the picture back up,

675
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,479
there's an interesting
little part on this

676
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,773
because this is one
that I talked about before

677
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:41,733
that has
explosive cratering on it

678
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,485
because it went through
an explosion,

679
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,737
and I can show that
and prove it on that piece.

680
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,907
‐So, do you need me
to scan around?
‐Right...

681
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,535
‐See that right there?
‐VELASQUEZ: That pit?

682
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:54,204
KIMBLER:
That pit right there is
an explosive crater.

683
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:57,582
NARRATOR
Explosive cratering?

684
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,918
Could this
curious feature indicate

685
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,795
that the metal fragments
Frank found,

686
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:04,589
in separate locations
near Roswell,

687
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,384
came from exploded objects?

688
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:11,096
Perhaps even one or more
extraterrestrial crafts?

689
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,934
As the team tests
the rest of the metal fragments,

690
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,061
they are surprised to discover

691
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:21,690
that nearly all of them seem to
have the same elemental makeup.

692
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:24,151
There's definitely a similarity.

693
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:26,611
I mean, it looks like
it's the same material.

694
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,363
It's just
in different proportions.

695
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,948
(clicks tongue)
Boy.

696
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,617
VELASQUEZ:
So, it could be the same stuff.

697
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,036
‐KIMBLER: I think
we have the proof.
‐HOWE: Yeah.

698
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,539
KIMBLER:
We just need to get
more testing done.

699
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:40,208
I can't wait to learn
what we'll find out next.

700
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,544
NARRATOR:
The battery of tests

701
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,546
being performed by the U. S. Army

702
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:47,382
on Linda's layered metal
fragments could take months

703
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,842
or even years.

704
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:51,303
In the meantime,

705
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,722
the material collected
from the Roswell skip site

706
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:57,434
has been sent to another lab
for further analysis.

707
00:32:57,434 --> 00:33:00,937
But curiously, one element

708
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:03,940
that has already been detected
in Professor Kimbler's materials

709
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:07,485
has also been found
in another metal fragment

710
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:10,238
suspected to be debris
from a UFO,

711
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:14,409
and from a location
on the other side of the world.

712
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,209
NARRATOR:
The Roswell incident remains
the most well‐known

713
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:24,169
UFO event in history,

714
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:27,505
but there have been reports
of numerous other UFO crashes

715
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,341
all over the world,

716
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:32,844
as well as the recovery
of strange metal debris.

717
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:37,474
In 1991, geologists searching
for gold deposits

718
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:41,811
in Russia's Ural Mountains made
a highly unexpected discovery.

719
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:44,564
At depths of over 30 feet,

720
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:48,902
they found a scattering of
tiny metal coils and springs.

721
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:56,201
CHILDRESS:
Russian scientists are finding
these tiny nanoparticles.

722
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:57,953
They found thousands
of these things.

723
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:00,205
They have to look at them
through microscopes.

724
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:02,082
They're‐they're‐‐
Some of them are just

725
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:05,919
one ten‐thousandth of an inch,
you know, in size.

726
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,338
There are all kinds of spirals

727
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:11,216
and tiny machined bits.

728
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:14,803
When they look at it, they seem
to be exactly like the kind of

729
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:17,305
tiny nanoparticles
and machine bits

730
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,266
that we are creating today.

731
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:24,896
What you see under the electron
microscope is mind‐boggling

732
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,732
because you see spirals.

733
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:31,069
You see definitely something
where the scientists

734
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,906
who investigated this
came to the conclusion

735
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:38,618
that these items are
artificially made

736
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,620
out of tungsten and molybdenum.

737
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:44,082
And so that right there
is incredibly interesting

738
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:48,295
because that was found exactly
at the skip site.

739
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:53,008
NARRATOR:
Molybdenum is the same material
detected in the metal fragments

740
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:56,428
that Frank Kimbler found
in the desert outside Roswell.

741
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:59,097
It is a super‐strong element

742
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,975
commonly used
in NASA spacecraft.

743
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,104
YURI KARASH:
These microscopic spirals

744
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:09,774
were made of wolfram
and molybdenum.

745
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:13,194
The melting temperature
for wolfram is above

746
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,030
6,000 degrees Fahrenheit,

747
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:18,950
and for molybdenum is about
5,000 degrees Fahrenheit.

748
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,123
TRAVIS TAYLOR:
Some, uh, version of NASA
from some other star system

749
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:28,918
could send a probe here
to Earth, and it could fail, uh,

750
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:32,297
and crash into Earth, and‐and
we would look at it and think,

751
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:33,840
"Wow, where did this come from?"

752
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,802
Maybe one day, we might be
creating our own Roswell

753
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,305
when we send our first probe
to the nearest star.

754
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:43,642
NARRATOR:
Ancient astronaut theorists
point out

755
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:47,062
that dozens of visitors to
the Ural Mountains have reported

756
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:50,315
encounters with strange,
cigar‐shaped craft

757
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:52,734
trailing fire across the sky.

758
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:56,821
Could this be
the Russian Roswell?

759
00:35:56,821 --> 00:36:00,617
Indeed, people living
in the Ural Mountains,

760
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:03,495
maybe more often than, uh,

761
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:06,206
people living in
other parts of Russia,

762
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:10,543
witness some strange phenomena
in the air and on the ground.

763
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:16,508
PAUL STONEHILL:
Ural Mountains are
a very interesting space

764
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:19,928
in the paranormal history
of Russia.

765
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:23,181
And I've studied a lot
because there have always been

766
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:27,018
incredible UFO sightings
in the Ural Mountains.

767
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,896
There are stories
of civilizations

768
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:32,524
that have disappeared
or went under the ground.

769
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:36,945
Uh, the so‐called, uh, dwarf
people in the Ural Mountains.

770
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:41,866
NARRATOR:
If the nanoparticles discovered
in the Ural Mountains are debris

771
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,702
from a crashed alien craft,

772
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:47,247
they bring up another
intriguing possibility,

773
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:50,542
because based on how deep below
the earth they were found,

774
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:54,546
they could have been deposited
there thousands of years ago.

775
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:57,257
There's thinking that
these things must be

776
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:59,092
over 50,000 years old.

777
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:02,595
So, is this also a debris field

778
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:07,726
from a crashed extraterrestrial
craft in the Ural Mountains?

779
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:11,813
There could be crash sites
all over the world

780
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:14,691
that are hundreds of thousands
of years old,

781
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:17,193
right up to modern times.

782
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,573
NARRATOR:
Rumors abound that
there are facilities

783
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,908
located all over the world
holding the remnants

784
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:27,162
of crashed
extraterrestrial craft,

785
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:29,998
like in the remote hills
of China,

786
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:32,250
at Pine Gap in Australia,

787
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,919
and Rudloe Manor in England.

788
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:41,092
TSOUKALOS:
Who knows if over the chronology
of the history of planet Earth

789
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:45,805
there were more craft, just like
at Roswell, that crashed?

790
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:49,768
NARRATOR:
Is it possible that Roswell is

791
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:52,437
just one of many locations
on planet Earth

792
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:55,440
where debris from
crashed extraterrestrial craft

793
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,066
can be found?

794
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:02,614
Perhaps further testing that was
conducted on the metal fragments

795
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:05,158
unearthed near the Roswell
skip site will reveal

796
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:09,537
indisputable evidence
of alien visitation.

797
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:19,631
NARRATOR:
Giorgio Tsoukalos meets
Linda Moulton Howe at her home

798
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,925
two weeks after sending out
the materials collected

799
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:25,386
at the Roswell crash site to
a laboratory in Dallas, Texas,

800
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,971
for further testing.

801
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:30,308
Aaron Velasquez, who performed
the initial testing,

802
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,812
has received and analyzed
the data.

803
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:36,356
‐Hi, Aaron.
‐Good to see you again.
How are you?

804
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,233
Nice to see you guys.
I've been well.

805
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:40,902
We're sitting here
on pins and needles.

806
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,445
So, what can you show us?

807
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:46,950
<i>So, we found that, of the</i>
<i>samples of Frank's material,</i>

808
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,702
<i>three of them,</i>
<i>while they look like the rest,</i>

809
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:52,831
have a very, very high
concentration of carbon in them.

810
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:55,542
<i>Much more than the aluminum,</i>
<i>despite what they look like.</i>

811
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:57,210
<i>There's been some supposition</i>

812
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:00,338
<i>that that could be</i>
<i>from high heat.</i>

813
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,090
So that was odd.

814
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,300
But odder still is we had

815
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,678
<i>one sample of the five</i>
<i>which had</i>

816
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:09,472
indium, which is
a very rare element.

817
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,683
<i>So it's not the sort of thing</i>
<i>that you would get</i>

818
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:14,227
<i>by accident, guaranteed.</i>

819
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:15,770
So are we talking
about something

820
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,021
that's really strange here?

821
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,440
Yes. Yes.

822
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,902
Well, uh, what about
those wires that we found?

823
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,404
<i>Yeah.</i>

824
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:25,697
So, that is also odd.

825
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:28,575
So, the elements that
we found with the wire

826
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:31,703
were all explainable, except
it, too, had indium in it.

827
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:34,914
What about evidence
of impact and heat?

828
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:37,125
<i>Yes, that's another thing</i>
<i>that we noted.</i>

829
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,668
<i>It was very obvious</i>

830
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:40,587
<i>under the scanning</i>
<i>electron microscope</i>

831
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:43,798
that these had been subjected
to very, very high heat.

832
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:44,966
<i>They were melted.</i>

833
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,634
<i>There was also</i>
<i>some shearing apparent.</i>

834
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:50,471
<i>So, these were, these were</i>
<i>cut or sliced by...</i>

835
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:54,017
by some action as well over
the years, or‐or at an impact.

836
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:58,104
That's‐that's incredible.

837
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,815
<i>Yes, it's very interesting.</i>

838
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,234
NARRATOR:
For Giorgio and Linda,

839
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:06,905
the results are nothing less
than astonishing.

840
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:10,074
Multiple tests have now
confirmed that the materials

841
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,035
recovered at
the Roswell skip site

842
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:14,495
are of a highly unusual nature,

843
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:18,625
and show evidence of having been
subjected to an explosion.

844
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:23,004
Might the strange layered
material being examined

845
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:27,050
by the U. S. Army prove to be
even more extraordinary?

846
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:30,261
HOWE:
In the bismuth, magnesium, zinc,

847
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,389
we're dealing with technologies
that astound people

848
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:37,143
who are in exotic metals
because they couldn't make

849
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:39,562
the bismuth, magnesium, zinc,

850
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:43,733
and a physicist tells me
this is the key.

851
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:49,030
This is the crux of
how this kind of technology

852
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:53,868
makes possible
the unidentified flying objects

853
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,955
move in such astounding ways.

854
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:59,332
MAN:
Whoa!

855
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:02,335
And in this whole issue
of finding

856
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:06,923
more materials from UFOs,
I'm still on the trail.

857
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:13,972
TSOUKALOS: Oftentimes,
I'm told that to suggest that

858
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:19,352
a UFO, an extraterrestrial
craft, crashed at Roswell

859
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:24,065
is nonsensical because
extraterrestrials can fly

860
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:27,986
across the galaxy,
and then they crash on Earth?

861
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:29,904
Well, yeah. You know why?

862
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,824
'Cause it's technology,
and technology fails.

863
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:39,706
I think that there may be more
material there to be found.

864
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:42,000
NARRATOR:
Is physical evidence

865
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,713
of an extraterrestrial presence
on Earth right beneath our feet?

866
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:49,924
Could there be debris
from crashed alien craft

867
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:53,177
not only in
the New Mexico desert

868
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,555
but all across the world?

869
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:59,017
Perhaps the materials that have
already been recovered

870
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:01,811
will soon provide
the ultimate proof

871
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:04,522
that we are not alone
in the universe,

872
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:08,693
or even on our own planet.

1
00:00:00,773 --> 00:00:03,252
There's a big old nostalgia trip
under way.

2
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:04,932
NEIL: We don't know how Marie
was killed.

3
00:00:04,933 --> 00:00:06,612
They never established
a cause of death.

4
00:00:06,613 --> 00:00:08,092
But there's something, or someone,

5
00:00:08,093 --> 00:00:09,772
that Drew and Izzy
aren't talking about.

6
00:00:09,773 --> 00:00:11,412
DI McKinven's been given
the go-ahead

7
00:00:11,413 --> 00:00:13,092
to reopen the investigation.

8
00:00:13,093 --> 00:00:15,012
But while Kathy's working
on your mum's case,

9
00:00:15,013 --> 00:00:16,772
you can't be employed by SIFA.

10
00:00:16,773 --> 00:00:18,532
We hope to find further evidence.

11
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:20,012
The first dig was amateur.

12
00:00:20,013 --> 00:00:21,412
How far do these go back?

13
00:00:21,413 --> 00:00:24,252
Don't want nosy bastards
poking about in our paperwork.

14
00:00:24,253 --> 00:00:28,012
Something about me threatens him.
I strongly believe he knew my mum.

15
00:00:28,013 --> 00:00:29,652
What is your problem with my dad?

16
00:00:29,653 --> 00:00:32,172
I don't want it. I'm not having it.
And I don't want you!

17
00:00:32,173 --> 00:00:33,452
Well, I don't want you!

18
00:00:33,453 --> 00:00:35,132
Did you see Phil at Tall Ships?

19
00:00:35,133 --> 00:00:36,372
He was visiting his wife.

20
00:00:36,373 --> 00:00:37,412
He wasn't with me.

21
00:00:37,413 --> 00:00:38,932
Drew's a greedy wee bastard

22
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:42,267
who wouldn't let her out
of his clutches.

23
00:00:43,573 --> 00:00:45,292
You're causing a lot of trouble.

24
00:00:45,293 --> 00:00:49,793
We both know it can be very painful
raking up the past.

I'm looking for Emma Hedges.

33
00:02:13,413 --> 00:02:14,613
Just a moment.

34
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:21,533
KNOCK ON DOOR,
DOOR OPENS

35
00:02:23,093 --> 00:02:24,413
Hello. Hi.

36
00:02:24,493 --> 00:02:25,932
I'm looking for Emma Hedges.

37
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:27,252
She doesn't work here any more.

38
00:02:27,253 --> 00:02:28,453
How come?

39
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:31,092
That's not something I can share.

40
00:02:31,093 --> 00:02:32,692
Is she still in Dundee?

41
00:02:32,693 --> 00:02:33,777
I don't know.

42
00:02:33,813 --> 00:02:38,892
Well, is she back in Manchester?
Sorry, I don't know who you are.

43
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:40,143
Daniel MacAfee.

44
00:02:41,213 --> 00:02:43,093
I'm Professor Gordon.

45
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:45,932
Could you possibly tell me
where she is?

46
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:47,133
No.

47
00:02:47,213 --> 00:02:48,812
I need to get in touch with her.

48
00:02:48,813 --> 00:02:51,693
Look, I know her, right?

49
00:02:51,773 --> 00:02:54,492
Her aunt's called Julie.
Julie has insomnia.

50
00:02:54,493 --> 00:02:56,412
The GC-MS machine's called Bobby.

51
00:02:56,413 --> 00:02:58,532
You're all obsessed with cake.

52
00:02:58,533 --> 00:03:01,572
If you've tried to contact Emma,
which I presume you have,

53
00:03:01,573 --> 00:03:02,972
and she hasn't responded,

54
00:03:02,973 --> 00:03:06,223
she doesn't want to be contacted
by you.

55
00:03:07,493 --> 00:03:08,573
All right.

56
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:14,732
I actually really liked him.

57
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:15,893
Me too.

58
00:03:17,093 --> 00:03:19,252
NEIL: We've reopened
the investigation

59
00:03:19,253 --> 00:03:21,012
into the murder of Marie Monroe.

60
00:03:21,013 --> 00:03:22,852
We have some new leads to pursue

61
00:03:22,853 --> 00:03:24,932
and the investigation
is progressing.

62
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:28,932
I'm hopeful we'll be in a position
to finally bring to justice

63
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:32,017
the perpetrator of this
awful crime...

64
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:37,280
...and be able to give Marie's family
some peace of mind.

65
00:03:42,733 --> 00:03:44,692
The police are ready to do a raid.

66
00:03:44,693 --> 00:03:47,492
They think they've found
a clandestine drug lab.

67
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:50,653
If it is, they want me to go.

68
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:52,133
Fantastic.

69
00:03:52,213 --> 00:03:53,492
I'm taking you with me.

70
00:03:53,493 --> 00:03:55,243
Seriously? Of course.

71
00:03:55,253 --> 00:03:56,572
It'd be great training.

72
00:03:56,573 --> 00:03:58,693
Emma would love all this.

73
00:03:58,773 --> 00:04:00,013
I know.

74
00:04:01,453 --> 00:04:02,612
How are you, Dan?

75
00:04:02,613 --> 00:04:03,972
Me? I'm OK. What's up?

76
00:04:03,973 --> 00:04:05,892
Why do you need me
to turn the house upside down?

77
00:04:05,893 --> 00:04:09,292
I told you,
it's to do with the court case.

78
00:04:09,293 --> 00:04:12,372
Anything with Secrets nightclub
on it?

79
00:04:12,373 --> 00:04:14,623
Yeah. It'll be summer 2008.

80
00:04:15,413 --> 00:04:17,453
Aren't you curious?

81
00:04:17,533 --> 00:04:18,783
I'd be curious.

82
00:04:20,013 --> 00:04:21,333
About what?

83
00:04:21,335 --> 00:04:26,433
Where I think your father might have been
the night DI McKinven was asking about.

84
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:29,768
Well, it sounds like you want to
tell me.

85
00:04:30,893 --> 00:04:33,227
He'd have been with a woman.

86
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,740
When you had cancer? Yeah.

87
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,110
Or when I didn't.

88
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:42,092
How come you didn't kick him out?

89
00:04:42,093 --> 00:04:44,510
Well, if you remember, I did.

90
00:04:45,693 --> 00:04:48,610
It just took me ten years to do it.

91
00:04:56,613 --> 00:05:00,372
I take it you're not interested
in Secrets before it was Secrets?

92
00:05:00,373 --> 00:05:01,373
Why?

93
00:05:01,453 --> 00:05:06,953
There's one here for Tempo Tyres,
which is what Secrets used to be.

94
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:21,483
Can I take all this away with me?

95
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:23,852
Is there something
you don't want me to see?

96
00:05:23,853 --> 00:05:26,853
No, I just want to file it properly.

97
00:06:17,893 --> 00:06:20,412
The first investigation
didn't record anything

98
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:21,532
about the spoil heap,

99
00:06:21,533 --> 00:06:23,772
so we can't say whose spoil heap
we've found.

100
00:06:23,773 --> 00:06:26,772
Ah, the person that dumped the body,
or the people that dug it up.

101
00:06:26,773 --> 00:06:28,252
Well, that's a blow.

102
00:06:28,253 --> 00:06:30,003
Yeah, but this isn't.

103
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:33,972
We thought we were
at the base of the grave,

104
00:06:33,973 --> 00:06:37,132
because it's compacted,
but it's like a false floor.

105
00:06:37,133 --> 00:06:40,052
There's a pocket of undisturbed soil
below it.

106
00:06:40,053 --> 00:06:42,532
It looks like the first dig
didn't go deep enough.

107
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:44,132
So, you're getting to the soil

108
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:46,092
the first investigation
never searched?

109
00:06:46,093 --> 00:06:47,427
That's the plan.

110
00:06:54,813 --> 00:06:57,492
Where'd you get this?
The garage at Mum's.

111
00:06:57,493 --> 00:07:00,372
It's the invoice for the supplies
when we did the refurb at Secrets.

112
00:07:00,373 --> 00:07:03,173
I can see what it is, son. OK.

113
00:07:03,253 --> 00:07:06,652
Plasterboard, cheaper than
half-inch, which is standard.

114
00:07:06,653 --> 00:07:09,732
Half-inch board skimmed with plaster
gives you a half-hour fire rating.

115
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:11,493
This one doesn't.

116
00:07:11,573 --> 00:07:13,213
I know that now.

117
00:07:13,293 --> 00:07:15,627
And I didn't know that then.

118
00:07:16,253 --> 00:07:18,413
Check out these doors.

119
00:07:18,493 --> 00:07:21,373
These would have burnt in no time.

120
00:07:21,453 --> 00:07:26,037
I mean, it makes me sick
when I see what an idiot I was.

121
00:07:26,853 --> 00:07:28,572
Try not to be too hard on yourself.

122
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:29,972
Well, it's pretty disgraceful.

123
00:07:29,973 --> 00:07:32,852
But you must have thought
this stuff was fit for purpose, too?

124
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:34,772
You signed off on it, Dad.
Of course I did.

125
00:07:34,773 --> 00:07:37,212
I was a director.
You sign things in your sleep.

126
00:07:37,213 --> 00:07:39,297
And you checked the work.

127
00:07:40,053 --> 00:07:41,812
And do you think you pointed out
to me

128
00:07:41,813 --> 00:07:43,932
how you left a gaping void
above the false ceilings?

129
00:07:43,933 --> 00:07:46,652
Or do you think you just wanted
to impress me with how you'd come in

130
00:07:46,653 --> 00:07:48,412
on budget and done it on time?

131
00:07:48,413 --> 00:07:51,247
Of course I wanted to impress you.

132
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:56,372
You keep saying that,
for the purposes of the court,

133
00:07:56,373 --> 00:07:58,123
we did nothing wrong.

134
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:01,572
I want to know, for the purposes
of you and me,

135
00:08:01,573 --> 00:08:03,692
if you really think
we did nothing wrong.

136
00:08:03,693 --> 00:08:06,572
I think you did a crappy piece of
work, and I was too busy to notice.

137
00:08:06,573 --> 00:08:08,293
Right.

138
00:08:08,373 --> 00:08:10,372
Cos you'd never do a crappy piece
of work.

139
00:08:10,373 --> 00:08:15,213
Look, when Shuggie turned
his tyre place into Secrets,

140
00:08:15,293 --> 00:08:17,092
he did it by the book.

141
00:08:17,093 --> 00:08:21,492
He'd got everything signed off
with an unfinished area.

142
00:08:21,493 --> 00:08:25,012
Then he got us in to do the refurb,
after the fact,

143
00:08:25,013 --> 00:08:26,693
on the cheap.

144
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,092
Did Shuggie know we used

145
00:08:28,093 --> 00:08:30,332
poor-quality materials
in those rooms?

146
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,750
Of course he did.

147
00:08:32,573 --> 00:08:34,073
No doubt about it.

148
00:08:39,973 --> 00:08:43,057
What else have you got up
your sleeve?

149
00:08:49,733 --> 00:08:53,532
Were you unfaithful to Mum
when she had cancer?

150
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,092
Is that what this is about?

151
00:08:55,093 --> 00:08:57,053
It's one of the things.

152
00:08:57,133 --> 00:08:59,452
You need to make your mind up
what we're talking about here.

153
00:08:59,453 --> 00:09:01,772
Cos if you're just out
to have a go at me in general,

154
00:09:01,773 --> 00:09:03,292
you can get to fuck.

155
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,092
In fact, it's the same thing.

156
00:09:05,093 --> 00:09:06,772
Which is what? You...

157
00:09:06,773 --> 00:09:08,773
...getting away with it.

158
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:12,172
You talk to me about getting away
with it?

159
00:09:12,173 --> 00:09:14,412
You're the fucking little prince
of getting away with it.

160
00:09:14,413 --> 00:09:16,412
You never had the builder's eye.

161
00:09:16,413 --> 00:09:18,213
Ever.

162
00:09:18,293 --> 00:09:19,793
Not got it in you.

163
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:22,132
Your job comes from me.

164
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:24,853
Your car comes from me.

165
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:27,132
Your apartment comes from me.

166
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:30,633
You're a spoilt wee bastard
with no talent.

167
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:33,692
I'm smarter than you are, Daniel.

168
00:09:33,693 --> 00:09:35,852
So, if you're going to take me on,

169
00:09:35,853 --> 00:09:38,103
the thing to remember is...

170
00:09:38,173 --> 00:09:39,693
...I'll win.

171
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:52,623
I wouldn't bank on it, Dad.

172
00:09:59,619 --> 00:10:03,202
Clasp your hands behind your back
so you're not tempted to touch anything.

173
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:04,520
Just look.

174
00:10:42,293 --> 00:10:46,293
LOUISE: God, they're all there.
Every single one.

175
00:10:47,573 --> 00:10:50,323
I wish Emma was here to see this.

176
00:11:05,813 --> 00:11:07,292
This is the original grave.

177
00:11:07,293 --> 00:11:08,852
You can see by the marks

178
00:11:08,853 --> 00:11:11,332
it was dug with a pickaxe
and a spade.

179
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,250
Someone did a good job.

180
00:11:13,253 --> 00:11:15,013
Yeah. 11? 12?

181
00:11:20,853 --> 00:11:22,053
A rib.

182
00:11:23,893 --> 00:11:25,653
Come on, Marie.

183
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:29,013
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

184
00:11:35,213 --> 00:11:37,253
You can't see it?

185
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,533
No.

186
00:11:40,613 --> 00:11:42,173
It's a boot print.

187
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,560
Let's check shoe sizes.

188
00:12:04,634 --> 00:12:08,274
Vincent, Izzy, Drew, Phil, Jimmy.

189
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:13,314
TAPPING AND SHAKING

190
00:12:27,677 --> 00:12:30,437
Kathy, come here.

191
00:12:40,757 --> 00:12:42,997
Hello, little hyoid bone.

192
00:12:47,157 --> 00:12:50,237
They never had a cause of death.

193
00:12:50,317 --> 00:12:53,037
Maybe now we do.

194
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:00,917
CLATTERING

195
00:13:03,677 --> 00:13:05,677
PHONE RINGS

196
00:13:09,357 --> 00:13:10,557
Hello?

197
00:13:10,637 --> 00:13:13,876
SKYE: Emma, sorry, I need to speak
to you.

198
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:15,076
My mum's terrible.

199
00:13:15,077 --> 00:13:16,597
She's stable now,

200
00:13:16,677 --> 00:13:19,596
but the doctors have told her
to get her affairs in order.

201
00:13:19,597 --> 00:13:21,237
No.

202
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:24,397
I'm phoning you to eat humble pie.

203
00:13:24,477 --> 00:13:28,117
She wants to talk
to the two of us together.

204
00:13:28,197 --> 00:13:31,076
She says she needs
to make her peace.

205
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:32,397
Will you come?

206
00:13:39,717 --> 00:13:42,717
So, is Daniel MacAfee
your boyfriend?

207
00:13:42,757 --> 00:13:45,197
Not any more. Good.

208
00:13:45,277 --> 00:13:48,716
I nearly died when that bastard
told me about the two of you.

209
00:13:48,717 --> 00:13:50,476
He thinks I set you up.

210
00:13:50,477 --> 00:13:52,037
Which bastard?

211
00:13:52,117 --> 00:13:53,357
Phil MacAfee.

212
00:13:53,437 --> 00:13:55,316
How'd you know Phil MacAfee?

213
00:13:55,317 --> 00:13:57,116
Who's Phil MacAfee?
Daniel's dad.

214
00:13:57,117 --> 00:13:58,701
Did he know my mum?

215
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:00,957
Yes.

216
00:14:01,037 --> 00:14:04,437
Your mum was cheating on Jimmy
with Drew.

217
00:14:04,517 --> 00:14:06,996
Phil was cheating on his wife
with me.

218
00:14:06,997 --> 00:14:09,331
Well, we all liked to party.

219
00:14:09,477 --> 00:14:12,157
Emma, this is news to me.

220
00:14:12,237 --> 00:14:13,677
IZZY SIGHS

221
00:14:15,157 --> 00:14:18,574
How much do you remember
about Tall Ships?

222
00:14:18,637 --> 00:14:20,757
I remember us dancing.

223
00:14:21,797 --> 00:14:24,396
I remember Mum in her pink dress.
Pink dress.

224
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,037
That's right.

225
00:14:26,117 --> 00:14:28,636
And I remember wanting to stay
with Mum

226
00:14:28,637 --> 00:14:30,476
and being annoyed
I had to go home with Jimmy.

227
00:14:30,477 --> 00:14:33,636
Aye. I remember wanting you to stay
so we could go on the teacups.

228
00:14:33,637 --> 00:14:36,356
We went on those teacups
after you'd gone.

229
00:14:36,357 --> 00:14:39,036
Marie thought
she'd had too much to drink,

230
00:14:39,037 --> 00:14:41,636
so she said she'd meet us after.

231
00:14:41,637 --> 00:14:43,397
And she never did.

232
00:14:44,677 --> 00:14:47,717
She texted me - she was going home.

233
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:50,956
And the next day,
Jimmy reported her missing,

234
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:52,707
and we all got jumpy.

235
00:14:53,637 --> 00:14:54,917
Why?

236
00:14:54,997 --> 00:14:57,436
We didn't want anyone else
finding out what we were up to,

237
00:14:57,437 --> 00:14:59,796
and we knew it was nothing
to do with Marie going missing.

238
00:14:59,797 --> 00:15:02,881
So, we dropped each other
like stones.

239
00:15:02,917 --> 00:15:04,556
Was Phil at Tall Ships?

240
00:15:04,557 --> 00:15:06,077
No.

241
00:15:06,157 --> 00:15:07,907
He was with his wife.

242
00:15:08,837 --> 00:15:09,997
Hospital.

243
00:15:12,237 --> 00:15:17,116
You should have told someone
that he knew my mum 18 years ago.

244
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:18,837
I should.

245
00:15:21,117 --> 00:15:23,476
After they found your mum's body,

246
00:15:23,477 --> 00:15:25,957
I went really wrong.

247
00:15:26,037 --> 00:15:28,077
How do you mean?

248
00:15:31,237 --> 00:15:33,317
I started using heroin.

249
00:15:34,797 --> 00:15:37,356
Skye was taken away from me
for a while.

250
00:15:37,357 --> 00:15:40,437
Mum... you've been a brilliant mum.

251
00:15:43,397 --> 00:15:46,956
I haven't been addicted to anything
in over ten years.

252
00:15:46,957 --> 00:15:49,476
But, see, the stigma, it never goes.

253
00:15:49,477 --> 00:15:51,061
You will be judged.

254
00:15:52,517 --> 00:15:54,517
You will not be trusted.

255
00:15:55,557 --> 00:15:57,057
What about my dad?

256
00:15:57,837 --> 00:16:00,036
Drew did what Phil told him.

257
00:16:00,037 --> 00:16:02,287
He dropped me like a stone.

258
00:16:02,317 --> 00:16:03,797
I had no-one.

259
00:16:05,997 --> 00:16:09,247
So I never said
what I should have said.

260
00:16:09,797 --> 00:16:13,397
Phil MacAfee knew who did it.

261
00:16:15,357 --> 00:16:19,356
I used to bother Phil for money
sometimes when I was in a bad way.

262
00:16:19,357 --> 00:16:21,917
He called me the sheep tick.

263
00:16:21,997 --> 00:16:24,747
I was on a loop about Marie once,

264
00:16:24,757 --> 00:16:27,156
and he says to me,
"If you don't shut up about Marie,

265
00:16:27,157 --> 00:16:30,491
"you'll end up cut up
just like she was."

266
00:16:30,493 --> 00:16:36,316
He says, "I know the guy who did it,
and he will do the same to you, too."

267
00:16:36,317 --> 00:16:40,477
Phil MacAfee kept me scared
for 18 years,

268
00:16:40,557 --> 00:16:42,756
and now he's threatening you two.

269
00:16:42,757 --> 00:16:44,837
Did he kill my mum?

270
00:16:46,517 --> 00:16:51,157
All I can tell you is
when... when Marie went missing

271
00:16:51,237 --> 00:16:53,116
and we were all getting jumpy
about the police,

272
00:16:53,117 --> 00:16:56,436
it was Phil who insisted
the three of us drop each other.

273
00:16:56,437 --> 00:16:58,676
It was Phil who insisted
we destroy the phones.

274
00:16:58,677 --> 00:17:00,117
What phones?

275
00:17:00,197 --> 00:17:02,277
Phil got them for us.

276
00:17:02,357 --> 00:17:04,077
One for each of us.

277
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:07,516
Then, if we wanted fixing between
each other, we used those phones.

278
00:17:07,517 --> 00:17:09,517
When she went missing...

279
00:17:10,637 --> 00:17:13,716
...Phil said,
"Get rid of the naughty phones,"

280
00:17:13,717 --> 00:17:16,301
cos that's what we called them.

281
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:19,471
What happened to them?

282
00:17:20,357 --> 00:17:22,941
I melted mine in the microwave.

283
00:17:23,757 --> 00:17:27,037
Drew threw his off the rig.

284
00:17:35,477 --> 00:17:37,076
Did you keep your naughty phone?

285
00:17:37,077 --> 00:17:39,677
STAMMERS: Get in.

286
00:17:41,117 --> 00:17:43,367
What are you talking about?

287
00:17:43,677 --> 00:17:44,996
I'm talking about cheap phones

288
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:48,756
Phil MacAfee bought you, Izzy and my
mum so you could get up to stuff.

289
00:17:48,757 --> 00:17:50,077
I...

290
00:17:50,157 --> 00:17:52,636
Look at your face.
You know what I'm talking about!

291
00:17:52,637 --> 00:17:54,996
OK, OK, I do, but I don't have it.

292
00:17:54,997 --> 00:17:57,397
I think I've seen it.

293
00:17:57,477 --> 00:17:59,396
I think it's in that suitcase
in there.

294
00:17:59,397 --> 00:18:00,397
It's not.

295
00:18:04,637 --> 00:18:06,397
Emma, leave it.

296
00:18:06,477 --> 00:18:07,917
Get off me!

297
00:18:07,997 --> 00:18:09,317
Leave it alone!

298
00:18:09,397 --> 00:18:11,557
DREW GRUNTS

299
00:18:14,055 --> 00:18:17,455
Phil told Izzy
he knew who killed Mum.

300
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,516
Izzy never said as much to me.

301
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:22,396
How could she, when you dropped her
like a stone?

302
00:18:22,397 --> 00:18:25,147
Phil told her he knew who did it,

303
00:18:25,265 --> 00:18:27,261
and that the same thing
would happen to her

304
00:18:27,262 --> 00:18:29,029
if she didn't shut
up, so she shut up.

305
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:31,636
Do you know what Izzy's
been through?

306
00:18:31,637 --> 00:18:37,221
Well, you left her to it, because
a man you barely knew told you to.

307
00:18:37,797 --> 00:18:39,356
Why did you keep it?

308
00:18:39,357 --> 00:18:41,596
It's a perfectly good phone.

309
00:18:41,597 --> 00:18:43,437
You're a liar, Dad.

310
00:18:43,517 --> 00:18:46,156
And you should've stuck by Izzy.

311
00:18:46,157 --> 00:18:48,196
Even if Phil did know
who killed Marie,

312
00:18:48,197 --> 00:18:49,277
even if,

313
00:18:49,357 --> 00:18:51,236
that phone won't prove it.

314
00:18:51,237 --> 00:18:53,476
It'll just prove
that four people were feckless,

315
00:18:53,477 --> 00:18:55,077
which we were,

316
00:18:55,157 --> 00:18:57,476
and took drugs, which we did.

317
00:18:57,477 --> 00:19:01,676
It'll prove the link between
the four of you, and that's a start.

318
00:19:01,677 --> 00:19:04,844
You've got to take this
to DI McKinven.

319
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:09,276
I don't even know what's on there.
No clue where the charger is.

320
00:19:09,277 --> 00:19:13,316
Look, Phil MacAfee always had cash,
so he funded me.

321
00:19:13,317 --> 00:19:16,151
I bought drugs and I sold them on.

322
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,196
Can I just tell you something?

323
00:19:18,197 --> 00:19:21,117
My girlfriend's having a baby.

324
00:19:21,197 --> 00:19:22,676
I'd like to be around.

325
00:19:22,677 --> 00:19:25,837
Hm. I'll take that into
consideration.

326
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:27,037
Thank you.

327
00:19:27,117 --> 00:19:28,437
OK.

328
00:19:28,517 --> 00:19:32,076
What was the relationship
between Marie and Phil MacAfee?

329
00:19:32,077 --> 00:19:34,676
What? I didn't even think
there was one.

330
00:19:34,677 --> 00:19:35,716
There was no sign.

331
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:38,916
Mind you, there wouldn't have been -
they wouldn't have wanted Izzy to know.

332
00:19:38,917 --> 00:19:42,476
Did you ever hear Phil say
he knew who killed Marie?

333
00:19:42,477 --> 00:19:44,037
Never.

334
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,836
Why'd you keep the phone?

335
00:19:46,837 --> 00:19:48,957
Don't know.

336
00:19:49,037 --> 00:19:50,876
Phil rang me, "Ditch the phone.

337
00:19:50,877 --> 00:19:52,711
"Chuck it in the sea."

338
00:19:53,677 --> 00:19:55,236
Were you suspicious?

339
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:56,477
No.

340
00:19:56,557 --> 00:19:59,716
Phil was visiting his wife,
Izzy had Skye, I was on the rig,

341
00:19:59,717 --> 00:20:01,236
Jimmy had the kids.

342
00:20:01,237 --> 00:20:03,571
We knew it wasn't any of us.

343
00:20:03,957 --> 00:20:05,756
How'd you know
Phil was visiting his wife?

344
00:20:05,757 --> 00:20:07,556
Because he texted Izzy on her,
you know,

345
00:20:07,557 --> 00:20:10,637
her, you know, one of them.

346
00:20:10,717 --> 00:20:13,157
Why did you keep yours?

347
00:20:13,237 --> 00:20:16,154
I don't like being told what to do.

348
00:20:20,317 --> 00:20:22,077
Well, when...

349
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,237
Maybe...

350
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:29,677
...some part of me
I didn't listen to...

351
00:20:32,677 --> 00:20:35,437
...knew I was being played.

352
00:20:41,837 --> 00:20:44,837
Pretty bad, when you think about it.

353
00:20:50,997 --> 00:20:53,037
When we first spoke,

354
00:20:53,117 --> 00:20:57,451
you mentioned that Marie had trouble
reaching orgasm.

355
00:20:57,917 --> 00:21:00,156
That there was a trick to it.

356
00:21:00,157 --> 00:21:01,157
Aye.

357
00:21:02,237 --> 00:21:03,821
What was the trick?

358
00:21:05,917 --> 00:21:07,251
Bit to the left.

359
00:21:08,717 --> 00:21:09,801
Take it slow.

360
00:21:11,157 --> 00:21:13,636
Was she into rough sex at all?

361
00:21:13,637 --> 00:21:14,677
No.

362
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:17,517
God, no.

363
00:21:19,717 --> 00:21:20,917
The opposite.

364
00:21:24,797 --> 00:21:26,957
DISTANT SIRENS

365
00:22:48,837 --> 00:22:49,917
Hello, Phil.

366
00:22:53,157 --> 00:22:55,677
Hello. How's it going?

367
00:22:55,757 --> 00:22:57,397
Fine.

368
00:22:59,717 --> 00:23:02,217
That looks like a nice coffee.

369
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:06,796
You were asked to keep away from me,
darling.

370
00:23:06,797 --> 00:23:09,881
It was the other way around,
actually.

371
00:23:11,637 --> 00:23:14,357
Sorry to interrupt your coffee.

372
00:23:14,437 --> 00:23:17,556
I just wanted to ask you something,
if that's OK.

373
00:23:17,557 --> 00:23:19,237
Is that OK?

374
00:23:20,477 --> 00:23:21,477
Sure.

375
00:23:28,797 --> 00:23:30,464
Did you kill my mum?

376
00:23:33,437 --> 00:23:36,854
HE SIGHS
I don't care what the police say.

377
00:23:38,077 --> 00:23:39,717
I think you did.

378
00:23:40,957 --> 00:23:42,116
You're not well.

379
00:23:42,117 --> 00:23:43,757
I'm fine.

380
00:23:44,877 --> 00:23:46,797
She's not well.

381
00:23:53,237 --> 00:23:54,837
See you later.

382
00:24:08,473 --> 00:24:12,107
I want my name left off the
indictment for culpable homicide.

383
00:24:12,108 --> 00:24:14,747
I'm prepared to give evidence
against my father to do it.

384
00:24:14,748 --> 00:24:15,947
What's your evidence?

385
00:24:15,948 --> 00:24:18,547
Well, I can prove
how he ran the business.

386
00:24:18,548 --> 00:24:21,787
I can show I did the same,
just imitated him, basically.

387
00:24:21,788 --> 00:24:24,587
But I can prove how,
since I've been running it on my own

388
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,987
and learned from different people,
that I've got better.

389
00:24:26,988 --> 00:24:28,068
Much better.

390
00:24:28,148 --> 00:24:30,068
OK.

391
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:39,375
This is the invoice for
the materials we used at Secrets.

392
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:44,667
This is a fake one my dad cooked up.

393
00:24:44,668 --> 00:24:49,168
Lied about the materials
we used to bump up the profit.

394
00:24:51,748 --> 00:24:54,427
Shuggie Brook thought
he had fire doors.

395
00:24:54,428 --> 00:24:56,588
My dad conned him.

396
00:24:56,668 --> 00:24:59,188
This shows intent to deceive.

397
00:24:59,268 --> 00:25:01,747
Does your dad know you've got this?

398
00:25:01,748 --> 00:25:03,588
No.

399
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:07,502
Do you want me
to pass this to the prosecutors?

400
00:25:07,948 --> 00:25:09,708
What would happen?

401
00:25:09,788 --> 00:25:11,587
Your father will be the only
accused,

402
00:25:11,588 --> 00:25:14,547
and you will be a witness
against him.

403
00:25:14,548 --> 00:25:17,027
This is going to be
a huge problem for him.

404
00:25:17,028 --> 00:25:19,187
I wouldn't like to be defending him.

405
00:25:19,188 --> 00:25:21,587
Do you want to think about it?

406
00:25:21,588 --> 00:25:22,588
No.

407
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:26,482
Pass 'em to the prosecutors.

408
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:56,387
KATHY: These are Marie Monroe's
exhumed remains from the cemetery.

409
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,555
Several bones are missing.

410
00:26:03,868 --> 00:26:07,827
And here are the bones
we recovered from the dump site.

411
00:26:07,828 --> 00:26:10,067
This is how she was dismembered.

412
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:13,547
The striation pattern
on the edges of the cut bone

413
00:26:13,548 --> 00:26:15,548
indicate a saw was used.

414
00:26:18,588 --> 00:26:21,308
The nick marks are knife cuts.

415
00:26:21,388 --> 00:26:25,627
The flesh was cut with a knife.
The bone - with a saw.

416
00:26:25,628 --> 00:26:27,045
Imagine doing it.

417
00:26:27,108 --> 00:26:29,267
You already had the trauma
of killing someone.

418
00:26:29,268 --> 00:26:31,947
Now you've gotta get rid of a body.

419
00:26:31,948 --> 00:26:35,187
Maybe rigor mortis set in.
You don't know it'll go away again,

420
00:26:35,188 --> 00:26:37,227
so you cut 'em up. It's traumatic.

421
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:38,978
It's a double trauma.

422
00:26:39,908 --> 00:26:41,748
The hyoid bone.

423
00:26:41,828 --> 00:26:43,947
When you squeeze someone
by the neck,

424
00:26:43,948 --> 00:26:47,907
the greater horns can displace
inwards and break.

425
00:26:47,908 --> 00:26:50,067
This was still wet and bendy
when it broke.

426
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:53,068
So, it happened before she was dead.

427
00:26:57,388 --> 00:26:59,148
There she is.

428
00:26:59,228 --> 00:27:00,228
Marie.

429
00:27:15,268 --> 00:27:17,868
PHONE BUZZES

430
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:21,388
Hello?

431
00:27:23,628 --> 00:27:26,545
I've nearly rung you so many times.

432
00:27:26,828 --> 00:27:29,307
So, Janine said,
"The principal wants to see you,"

433
00:27:29,308 --> 00:27:30,867
and I thought, "Oh, what now?"

434
00:27:30,868 --> 00:27:32,947
So, I trotted along,
and the principal says,

435
00:27:32,948 --> 00:27:35,467
"Do you know you've been nominated
for a police commendation

436
00:27:35,468 --> 00:27:38,467
"for tracing the supply of killer
drugs back to the factory?

437
00:27:38,468 --> 00:27:41,205
"I suppose I'd better stump up
and give you your own lab."

438
00:27:41,206 --> 00:27:42,448
- No.
- Yeah.

439
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,476
Photos from the scene

440
00:27:43,477 --> 00:27:46,550
have been sent to the international
drug investigation database,

441
00:27:46,551 --> 00:27:52,301
and this is all the result of you
spotting that unknown, so check you.

442
00:27:57,668 --> 00:28:02,168
Must be hard... with your mum's
investigation going on.

443
00:28:03,268 --> 00:28:05,185
Yeah, it has been hard.

444
00:28:05,988 --> 00:28:08,238
Feeling kept out of things.

445
00:28:10,228 --> 00:28:12,728
Daniel MacAfee came into SIFA.

446
00:28:13,428 --> 00:28:14,762
What did he say?

447
00:28:14,828 --> 00:28:18,328
He said he needed
to get in touch with you.

448
00:28:24,468 --> 00:28:27,027
SUPERINTENDENT: Look, it's clear
there's been sterling work

449
00:28:27,028 --> 00:28:29,747
on retrieving and reassembling
these remains.

450
00:28:29,748 --> 00:28:31,787
The hyoid bone
was a significant find.

451
00:28:31,788 --> 00:28:33,108
Thank you.

452
00:28:33,188 --> 00:28:36,947
But you haven't linked anyone
to these remains or productions.

453
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:39,067
You've got a size ten boot print.

454
00:28:39,068 --> 00:28:42,187
Three of the people you're looking
at are size ten. I'm size ten.

455
00:28:42,188 --> 00:28:45,987
Not one DNA match out of your
five persons of interest.

456
00:28:45,988 --> 00:28:49,107
Nothing gained from your positional
with Vincent Keir.

457
00:28:49,108 --> 00:28:51,347
Nothing solid on Jimmy Levin.

458
00:28:51,348 --> 00:28:53,507
And you still haven't spoken
to MacAfee.

459
00:28:53,508 --> 00:28:56,507
As I said, boss, I don't want him
to know we're interested in him.

460
00:28:56,508 --> 00:28:57,508
We are!

461
00:28:58,868 --> 00:29:02,147
Circumstantial evidence
coming out of your ears,

462
00:29:02,148 --> 00:29:05,147
but nothing that would stand up
in court.

463
00:29:05,148 --> 00:29:06,867
And to add insult to injury,

464
00:29:06,868 --> 00:29:08,107
your statement to the press

465
00:29:08,108 --> 00:29:10,387
effectively guaranteed
tying the whole thing up

466
00:29:10,388 --> 00:29:12,305
by the end of the week.

467
00:29:15,228 --> 00:29:17,395
Sorry I'm late. It's fine.

468
00:29:18,748 --> 00:29:20,787
Do you want to get a coffee?

469
00:29:20,788 --> 00:29:22,548
No.

470
00:29:24,068 --> 00:29:25,908
Do you want to walk?

471
00:29:25,988 --> 00:29:27,428
Yeah.

472
00:29:31,908 --> 00:29:33,347
What did you want?

473
00:29:33,348 --> 00:29:36,348
I wanted to ask you about my father.

474
00:29:36,468 --> 00:29:37,718
What about him?

475
00:29:39,548 --> 00:29:41,382
What you think he did.

476
00:29:42,148 --> 00:29:44,108
So you can tell him?

477
00:29:44,188 --> 00:29:46,107
I'm not speaking to him.

478
00:29:46,108 --> 00:29:48,775
I don't know if I can trust you.

479
00:29:51,148 --> 00:29:52,588
I'm not my dad.

480
00:29:55,268 --> 00:29:56,768
I can see him now.

481
00:29:58,228 --> 00:29:59,478
I'm not my dad.

482
00:30:01,668 --> 00:30:04,347
We're not going to be possible
if I tell you.

483
00:30:04,348 --> 00:30:05,748
I know that.

484
00:30:05,828 --> 00:30:08,987
But we're not very possible now,
are we?

485
00:30:08,988 --> 00:30:10,468
No, but we were.

486
00:30:10,548 --> 00:30:11,948
I know.

487
00:30:12,028 --> 00:30:13,948
We were.

488
00:30:14,028 --> 00:30:17,778
We really were. I've never felt...
Me neither.

489
00:30:21,668 --> 00:30:22,668
I'm ready.

490
00:30:25,868 --> 00:30:27,707
Your dad and Izzy had a thing.

491
00:30:27,708 --> 00:30:30,468
2001? Yeah.

492
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:36,625
Your dad and Izzy and my mum
and Drew all hung out together.

493
00:30:37,388 --> 00:30:39,388
DI McKinven's got proof.

494
00:30:40,308 --> 00:30:43,148
Was my dad at Tall Ships?

495
00:30:43,228 --> 00:30:46,395
He told Izzy
that he was with your mum.

496
00:30:47,228 --> 00:30:48,628
He wasn't.

497
00:30:51,708 --> 00:30:53,948
Hey, he's right.

00:30:54,028 --> 00:30:55,268
Eh...

499
00:30:56,468 --> 00:30:58,987
He's a fucking bastard for doing it
in front of everybody,

500
00:30:58,988 --> 00:31:02,068
but... we haven't got the evidence.

501
00:31:03,948 --> 00:31:07,148
All that work... and hope...

502
00:31:07,228 --> 00:31:08,788
...and the money.

"Whit's fur ye'll no go by ye."

504
00:31:11,668 --> 00:31:13,908

Daniel? What can I do for you?

509
00:31:25,788 --> 00:31:28,747
My dad did work on Secrets
when it was a tyre place.

510
00:31:28,748 --> 00:31:31,307
Bought bags of cement and six
bollards,

511

fitted them in the car park.

I'm arresting you under Section One

522
00:33:22,698 --> 00:33:25,446
of the Criminal Justice
(Scotland) Act 2016

523
00:33:25,447 --> 00:33:28,887
for the abduction and murder
of Marie Monroe in 2001.

524
00:33:28,888 --> 00:33:31,388
You've got the wrong guy, pal.

525
00:33:38,291 --> 00:33:40,250
Were you at the Tall Ships Festival

526
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:44,085

or anywhere else, that evening?

530
00:33:52,491 --> 00:33:53,811
No comment.

00:33:59,651 --> 00:34:02,530
and that your son Daniel
was staying with his grandmother.

533
00:34:02,531 --> 00:34:05,281
Could you tell us where you were?

534
00:34:06,771 --> 00:34:08,050
SOLICITOR CLEARS THROAT

535
00:34:08,051 --> 00:34:11,370
I made it clear my client would be
giving a "no comment" interview.

536
00:34:11,371 --> 00:34:12,491
I remember.

537
00:34:17,691 --> 00:34:19,690
Drew Cubbin gave this phone to us.

538
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:21,770
Do you recognise this phone?

539
00:34:21,771 --> 00:34:25,211
It's 18 years old.
It's a pay-as-you-go.

540
00:34:25,291 --> 00:34:29,570
Our Digital Investigation Unit
was able to retrieve data from it.

541
00:34:29,571 --> 00:34:33,531
Texts from you to Drew Cubbin.

542
00:34:33,611 --> 00:34:36,050
From Izzy Alessi to Drew Cubbin.

543
00:34:36,051 --> 00:34:38,130
From Marie Monroe to Drew Cubbin.

544
00:34:38,131 --> 00:34:39,798
Making arrangements.

545
00:34:39,851 --> 00:34:42,491
Arrangements to meet.

546
00:34:42,571 --> 00:34:45,211
Arrangements to buy drugs.

547
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:48,708
Would you like to say
anything about that?

548
00:34:49,931 --> 00:34:54,598
They were able to retrieve
a few voicemail messages, too.

549
00:34:56,771 --> 00:34:57,891
BEEP

550
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,490
MARIE: Oh, hi, darling.

551
00:34:59,491 --> 00:35:02,690
Can you meet me at Izzy's tomorrow
at two? We won't have long.

552
00:35:02,691 --> 00:35:04,155
Izzy can fetch the girls from school,

553
00:35:04,157 --> 00:35:05,850
but I'll need to get
them back over at four

554
00:35:05,851 --> 00:35:08,330
cos Phil's going over,
and he'll want Iz to himself.

555
00:35:08,331 --> 00:35:10,651
Hey! Ring me, you bastard.

556
00:35:10,731 --> 00:35:12,490
I'm bored. And lonely.

557
00:35:12,491 --> 00:35:14,531
And horny.
MARIE LAUGHS

558
00:35:14,611 --> 00:35:16,131
BEEP

559
00:35:16,211 --> 00:35:17,890
Do you recognise that voice?

560
00:35:17,891 --> 00:35:19,391
It's Marie Monroe.

561
00:35:19,393 --> 00:35:21,555
Drew Cubbin confirms
that he and Marie

562
00:35:21,556 --> 00:35:23,770
would sometimes meet
for sex at Izzy's.

563
00:35:23,771 --> 00:35:29,021
We retrieved the headboard from
a bed that Izzy had at the time.

564
00:35:30,011 --> 00:35:32,178
Do you recognise that bed?

565
00:35:34,211 --> 00:35:37,878
Traces of semen on it
match your DNA profile.

566
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:41,011
How do you explain that?

567
00:35:42,731 --> 00:35:45,290
Do you recognise these, Mr MacAfee?

568
00:35:45,291 --> 00:35:50,050
These boots were recovered
from the Secrets car park in Lochee,

569
00:35:50,051 --> 00:35:53,930
under one of the bollards
you installed, August 14th, 2001.

570
00:35:53,931 --> 00:35:56,691
Those dark stains are blood.

571
00:35:56,771 --> 00:35:59,730
The blood matches
the DNA profile of Marie Monroe.

572
00:35:59,731 --> 00:36:05,065
We were also able to extract
a DNA profile from inside the boots.

573
00:36:06,091 --> 00:36:07,508
It matches yours.

574
00:36:08,531 --> 00:36:11,210
A boot print in the soil
at the dump site

575
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:14,931
is a match with the sole
of these boots.

576
00:36:15,011 --> 00:36:19,690
Can you explain why your boot
has Marie Monroe's blood on it...

577
00:36:19,691 --> 00:36:23,775
...and left a print
where her remains were dumped?

578
00:36:26,971 --> 00:36:32,471
We know Marie was wearing a pink
dress on the day she went missing.

579
00:36:33,411 --> 00:36:36,291
Do you remember that dress at all?

580
00:36:38,811 --> 00:36:41,228
Marie's movements are unknown

581
00:36:41,251 --> 00:36:44,850
after she left Izzy Alessi
at Tall Ships at 8.20pm.

582
00:36:44,851 --> 00:36:48,410
We believe she may have met someone
and been driven somewhere,

583
00:36:48,411 --> 00:36:50,130
as no-one saw her walking home,

584
00:36:50,131 --> 00:36:53,250
which is what she told Izzy
she was going to do.

585
00:36:53,251 --> 00:36:55,291
Do you have any idea

586
00:36:55,371 --> 00:36:57,530
where Marie Monroe
might have been that night?

587
00:36:57,531 --> 00:37:00,365
Or what she might have been doing?

588
00:37:01,051 --> 00:37:04,050
Or who she might have been
doing it with?

589
00:37:04,051 --> 00:37:07,218
You don't treat Izzy right.
Cut it out.

590
00:37:10,651 --> 00:37:13,330
Marie's remains were recovered
three months

591
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:15,650
after she was last seen alive.

592
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:17,611
We can't be precise

593
00:37:17,691 --> 00:37:21,441
about the circumstances
surrounding her death.

594
00:37:27,571 --> 00:37:29,821
But we do know some things.

595
00:37:29,971 --> 00:37:32,130
Her hyoid bone was broken.

596
00:37:32,131 --> 00:37:36,891
The break is consistent
with Marie having been throttled.

597
00:37:36,971 --> 00:37:41,388
We're thinking this is the most
likely cause of death.

598
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:47,490
After she was killed,
her body was dismembered.

599
00:37:47,491 --> 00:37:49,611
Whoever did it

600
00:37:49,691 --> 00:37:54,275
cut through the flesh of her legs
and arms with a knife.

601
00:37:54,331 --> 00:37:57,081
Cut through the bones with a saw.

602
00:37:57,571 --> 00:37:59,610
It's clear from the direction
of the cuts

603
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:02,690
Marie's body was on its front
when they did that.

604
00:38:02,691 --> 00:38:06,443
Perhaps they didn't want to look
at her face when they did it,

605
00:38:06,444 --> 00:38:07,930
so they rolled her over.

606
00:38:07,931 --> 00:38:10,848
Do you have any opinion about that?

607
00:38:25,531 --> 00:38:27,371
PHONE RINGS

608
00:38:30,251 --> 00:38:31,411
Hello?

609
00:38:31,491 --> 00:38:33,450
It's Neil. Can you talk?

610
00:38:33,451 --> 00:38:34,811
Yeah.

611
00:38:34,891 --> 00:38:36,210
Phil MacAfee's been charged.

612
00:38:36,211 --> 00:38:38,450
We charged him with murder,

613
00:38:38,451 --> 00:38:40,091
abduction, assault,

614
00:38:40,171 --> 00:38:42,410
dismemberment,
concealment of a body,

615
00:38:42,411 --> 00:38:44,330
attempt to pervert the course
of justice.

616
00:38:44,331 --> 00:38:46,370
We've thrown the book at him.

617
00:38:46,371 --> 00:38:48,570
He is one of the most cold
and calculated bastards

618
00:38:48,571 --> 00:38:50,321
I've ever dealt with.

619
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:53,458
Are you there?

620
00:38:53,491 --> 00:38:54,571
Yeah.

621
00:38:55,691 --> 00:38:57,770
I just need to let it sink in.

622
00:38:57,771 --> 00:38:59,355
I'll call you back.

623
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:01,971
Bye. OK, all right.

624
00:39:34,371 --> 00:39:36,530
Well, who needs a confession

625
00:39:36,531 --> 00:39:39,850
when you've got forensic evidence
as brilliant as that? Yes!

626
00:39:39,851 --> 00:39:41,291
Sorry we're late.

627
00:39:41,371 --> 00:39:44,130
The Super wanted to buy us a drink.
Right, come on.

628
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:46,210
Well, what is everybody having?
Trina's buying.

629
00:39:46,211 --> 00:39:49,610
Oh! I have to get back to my dogs.
But you wanna join us?

630
00:39:49,611 --> 00:39:51,250
You wanna come get drunk
in the country?

631
00:39:51,251 --> 00:39:53,370
Oh, sounds fun.
What do you reckon, boss?

632
00:39:53,371 --> 00:39:56,810
Ah, thanks for asking, Kathy,
but I'll get drunk in town.

633
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,890
Trina, you get drunk wherever
you like, of course.

634
00:39:58,891 --> 00:40:01,170
I'll get drunk with you, boss.
Thank you, though.

635
00:40:01,171 --> 00:40:03,171
Have you spoken to Emma?

636
00:40:03,251 --> 00:40:07,418
Yeah. Yeah. We're going to drop in
on her just now.

637
00:40:09,251 --> 00:40:13,771
The reason I'm not coming back
to Kathy's is...

638
00:40:15,611 --> 00:40:18,361
...I would say something foolish.

639
00:40:22,491 --> 00:40:23,991
I would love that.

640
00:40:29,971 --> 00:40:31,571
SOFTLY: Emma.

641
00:40:32,811 --> 00:40:34,611
I missed you.

642
00:41:11,211 --> 00:41:14,011
CHURCH BELL TOLLS

643
00:41:22,011 --> 00:41:24,345
MINISTER: Welcome, everyone.

644
00:41:25,091 --> 00:41:29,925
We are gathered here to celebrate
the life of Marie Monroe.

645
00:41:37,371 --> 00:41:41,621
DANIEL ON VOICEMAIL:
Emma, I've decided not to come.

646
00:41:42,571 --> 00:41:44,330
It meant a lot you wanted me there,

647
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:47,748
but I doubt the others
will feel the same.

648
00:41:51,011 --> 00:41:52,595
I'm leaving Dundee.

649
00:41:53,891 --> 00:41:55,725
My flat's up for sale.

650
00:41:58,171 --> 00:42:03,171
I want to give wherever I get
to the Nardonis and the Kumars.

651
00:42:03,931 --> 00:42:07,265
I'm so sorry
I won't see you before I go.

Then I'll go back to the circus.

We must tell Madam.

She'll kill me. It hurts.

- Well, Doctor?
- Her health's fragile.

165
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,384
It's her cornea. She has keratitis.

166
00:16:18,012 --> 00:16:18,887
Is she blind?

167
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,431
It's an inflammation.

168
00:16:22,892 --> 00:16:25,143
Be patient. It takes months.

169
00:16:26,187 --> 00:16:28,772
Take this to the pharmacy.

170
00:16:30,525 --> 00:16:31,399

Nobody's.

173
00:17:23,286 --> 00:17:26,163
Theresa, I rarely ask anything of you,

174
00:17:26,664 --> 00:17:28,582
I only ask that you hear little Edith.

175
00:17:29,876 --> 00:17:32,919
Go on, Edith. Speak to her. She'll listen.

176
00:17:33,379 --> 00:17:34,421
Go ahead.

177
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,464
Theresa,

178
00:17:37,133 --> 00:17:40,010
I don't want to be blind. I want to see.

179
00:17:40,219 --> 00:17:41,303
She's all bruised.

180
00:17:41,762 --> 00:17:42,596
Go on.

181
00:17:43,139 --> 00:17:46,516
I want to learn to read, and run like before.

182
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:48,101
I don't want to be blind.

183
00:17:48,311 --> 00:17:52,314
Saint Theresa,
tell baby Jesus to look after Edith.

184
00:17:53,274 --> 00:17:54,107
Go ahead.

185
00:17:55,067 --> 00:17:57,736
Thank you Saint Theresa and Jesus.

186
00:17:58,196 --> 00:18:00,071
Thank you.

187
00:18:37,193 --> 00:18:38,777
This is it. You're here, Edith.

188
00:20:05,823 --> 00:20:06,990
She can see...

189
00:20:08,868 --> 00:20:10,076
She can see!

190
00:20:19,503 --> 00:20:20,587
Titine, get up!

191
00:20:21,589 --> 00:20:22,422
What is it?

192
00:20:22,631 --> 00:20:24,466
He's back. He's taking Edith.

193
00:20:25,217 --> 00:20:26,051
Get dressed.

194
00:20:26,844 --> 00:20:29,137
They can't do that to me!

195
00:20:29,472 --> 00:20:31,556
How can you go back to that job?

196
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:33,683
She'll see the country.

197
00:20:34,435 --> 00:20:35,435
Go then.

198
00:20:37,271 --> 00:20:38,646
Edith!

199
00:20:38,856 --> 00:20:41,566
Titine!

200
00:20:42,318 --> 00:20:44,027
Don't take my little girl!

201
00:20:44,236 --> 00:20:46,321
Let her go!

202
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,156
Enough!

203
00:20:48,366 --> 00:20:49,783
She's mad!

204
00:20:50,201 --> 00:20:51,743
Stop it or you're out!

205
00:20:51,952 --> 00:20:53,953
You have no right!

206
00:21:00,378 --> 00:21:01,669
Don't do this to me!

207
00:21:01,879 --> 00:21:03,671
Go!

208
00:21:12,807 --> 00:21:14,224
I'll kill myself.

209
00:21:20,773 --> 00:21:21,689
We're at Orly airport.

210
00:21:23,943 --> 00:21:26,111
Passengers are disembarking.
I see her. It's Edith Piaf!

211
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,071
A young man's on her arm.

212
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,323
What did you bring from America?

213
00:21:30,533 --> 00:21:31,574
An American.

214
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:32,909
What's his name?

215
00:21:33,828 --> 00:21:36,496
Edith, please!

216
00:21:37,248 --> 00:21:40,750
Like her song,
she's "carried away by the crowd"...

217
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,795
She steps into her elegant black and white car.

218
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:47,924
She looks tired, but is all smiles.

219
00:21:55,015 --> 00:21:57,350
Silence! I propose a toast...

220
00:21:57,726 --> 00:21:59,519
What a slob!

221
00:21:59,979 --> 00:22:01,229
Slob yourself.

222
00:22:02,857 --> 00:22:04,732
Indulge the invalid.

223
00:22:06,444 --> 00:22:10,613
Watch out accordion man or you'll get a shiner!

224
00:22:12,241 --> 00:22:13,575
Perfect timing!

225
00:22:13,784 --> 00:22:16,995
Call the boss. I want free champagne!

226
00:22:17,455 --> 00:22:20,290
I'm Edith Piaf, and I made a mess.

227
00:22:21,417 --> 00:22:24,836
Everyone kiss. Even enemies!

228
00:22:25,254 --> 00:22:26,337
Kiss me, Claude.

229
00:22:35,764 --> 00:22:38,016
- Who's that broad?
- No idea.

230
00:22:38,225 --> 00:22:39,934
Who gets the steak tartare?

231
00:22:40,144 --> 00:22:42,604
Where did your handsome friend go?

232
00:22:42,813 --> 00:22:44,355
Don't embarrass her...

233
00:22:44,565 --> 00:22:46,983
Butt out Coquatrix, who rang your bell?

234
00:22:47,485 --> 00:22:49,694
Well... Mademoiselle!

235
00:22:49,904 --> 00:22:54,032
Miss Piaf, a pleasure! What can I do for you?

236
00:22:54,617 --> 00:22:56,951
A lot. I want a present.

237
00:22:57,453 --> 00:22:58,244
Naturally.

238
00:22:58,704 --> 00:22:59,704
Well...

239
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,374
I wanted champagne, but I'll take a ring,

240
00:23:03,626 --> 00:23:06,961
a big ring with diamonds studded everywhere.

241
00:23:07,171 --> 00:23:09,172
Don't trouble yourself, we'll have champagne.

242
00:23:11,383 --> 00:23:14,427
Here's a toast to the love I have for you all.

243
00:23:14,803 --> 00:23:16,846
And I'll stand up for that.

244
00:23:17,056 --> 00:23:18,348
Give me a hand.

245
00:23:22,603 --> 00:23:26,272
I'd like to make a toast to Marguerite.

246
00:23:27,775 --> 00:23:32,362
My composer, and my most loyal friend
in the business.

247
00:23:33,364 --> 00:23:37,116
Don't blush like that, you'll make us cry.

248
00:23:53,717 --> 00:23:54,842
You want an autograph?

249
00:23:55,386 --> 00:23:56,719
I don't think so.

250
00:23:59,348 --> 00:24:03,059
Bubbles and booze, perfect.
This is Claude's influence.

251
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:04,852
You're irritating, Loulou.

252
00:24:05,396 --> 00:24:08,731
We're just back to Paris, we had some fun.

253
00:24:12,027 --> 00:24:14,195
Don't play the broken hearted lover.

254
00:24:18,576 --> 00:24:20,702
I'm waiting for someone. Get lost.

255
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,496
Let me remind you, you have commitments.

256
00:24:24,373 --> 00:24:25,540
You're not alone.

257
00:24:26,292 --> 00:24:29,127
Remember the first night at Gerny's?

258
00:24:30,546 --> 00:24:34,299
I was a bum. She looked at me like a princess.

259
00:24:34,508 --> 00:24:37,260
You were a princess. My princess!

260
00:24:37,886 --> 00:24:40,263
To Marguerite!

261
00:24:40,848 --> 00:24:43,433
To those who want to see me fall on my face.

262
00:24:43,934 --> 00:24:46,394
They think I don't notice! Cheers.

263
00:24:52,943 --> 00:24:54,152
Something wrong, Louis?

264
00:24:54,612 --> 00:24:56,696
He's having a tantrum.

265
00:24:57,281 --> 00:24:58,948
Get lost, we're busy.

266
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:33,835
You don't watch the show. Get busy.

267
00:26:34,837 --> 00:26:37,505
You must work. There are no kids here.

268
00:26:38,424 --> 00:26:41,217
You have to earn your keep. That's enough.

269
00:26:45,723 --> 00:26:48,599
Little turd! You ruined my exit!

270
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:53,479
Go to the trailer. Make dinner.

271
00:26:53,772 --> 00:26:57,191
Ladies and gentlemen, a big hand for Louis,

272
00:26:57,401 --> 00:27:00,361
the contortionist!

273
00:27:45,073 --> 00:27:46,240
She's cute.

274
00:27:47,951 --> 00:27:48,951
How old is she?

275
00:27:49,787 --> 00:27:50,745
Ten.

276
00:27:52,164 --> 00:27:53,247
No mother?

277
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:55,666
What for?

278
00:27:56,752 --> 00:27:58,085
You must be lonely.

279
00:27:59,713 --> 00:28:02,423
How about some brandy, in your trailer?

280
00:28:04,593 --> 00:28:05,635
Come on over.

281
00:28:54,393 --> 00:28:55,685
<i>Do you know who I am?</i>

282
00:28:59,606 --> 00:29:00,898
<i>I'm Theresa.</i>

283
00:29:03,151 --> 00:29:04,944
<i>Are your eyes well, my angel?</i>

284
00:29:06,363 --> 00:29:07,321
Yes.

285
00:29:08,198 --> 00:29:12,201
<i>You're so sweet. Who'd you like to pray for?</i>

286
00:29:13,996 --> 00:29:15,746
I'll pray for Titine.

287
00:29:16,123 --> 00:29:19,375
<i>Good girl. I'm watching over you.</i>

288
00:29:20,168 --> 00:29:21,335
<i>Never forget.</i>

289
00:29:21,879 --> 00:29:24,797
<i>When you're alone, I'll always be there.</i>

290
00:29:42,858 --> 00:29:45,568
I've had it! I told you to change that wheel.

291
00:29:45,777 --> 00:29:49,071
Don't argue. Just help.
We're all in the same shit.

292
00:29:51,992 --> 00:29:53,826
- I don't give a damn!
- Then get lost!

293
00:29:58,332 --> 00:30:00,625
You can't quit. Not over a spat!

294
00:30:00,834 --> 00:30:02,075
I wasn't made to take orders.

295
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,361
I can't stand Caroli. He is a bad boss.

296
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,964
- You're drunk!
- I'll go solo.

297
00:30:07,215 --> 00:30:09,926
Fat chance! Circuses aren't on every corner.

298
00:30:10,135 --> 00:30:12,845
Don't worry. I always land on my feet.

299
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,057
You were growing on me.

300
00:30:16,266 --> 00:30:17,600
You'll get over it!

301
00:30:23,565 --> 00:30:26,400
Saint Theresa, make him change his mind.

302
00:30:26,818 --> 00:30:28,444
I want to stay in the circus.

303
00:31:12,948 --> 00:31:15,908
Edith!

304
00:32:10,422 --> 00:32:12,506
He's all in knots!

305
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,899
Is the girl in the act?

306
00:32:30,317 --> 00:32:31,734
Just a minute.

307
00:32:31,943 --> 00:32:33,152
Do something.

308
00:32:34,488 --> 00:32:36,655
They'll leave, do something.

309
00:32:38,867 --> 00:32:41,035
Come on, do something.

310
00:32:44,948 --> 00:32:48,584
<i>♪  Come, sons of the fatherland</i>

311
00:32:48,702 --> 00:32:52,456

Bravo!

325
00:33:49,271 --> 00:33:50,229
That's my daughter!

326
00:34:05,036 --> 00:34:06,954
I'm fed up with carrot juice.

327
00:34:07,164 --> 00:34:10,291
As long as I'm your nurse,
you'll have carrot juice.

328
00:34:14,671 --> 00:34:16,255
I prefer it dark, Simone.

329
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:19,008
It's sunny, it'll do you good.

330
00:34:30,604 --> 00:34:31,437
Edith,

331
00:34:31,688 --> 00:34:33,105
I know it's hard,

332
00:34:33,857 --> 00:34:36,859
you need lots and lots of rest

333
00:34:37,068 --> 00:34:38,652
and patience.

334
00:34:40,488 --> 00:34:42,323
Your husband called today...

335
00:34:42,532 --> 00:34:44,241
It's no use.

336
00:34:45,952 --> 00:34:47,703
What makes me sick...

337
00:34:48,747 --> 00:34:50,372
is that I overdid it.

338
00:34:52,834 --> 00:34:55,544
The last three years have been disastrous.

339
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,297
You're an artist.

340
00:35:01,843 --> 00:35:02,885
Simone?

341
00:35:07,849 --> 00:35:11,060
I won't sing again, will I?

342
00:35:40,382 --> 00:35:41,757
What are you looking at?

343
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,134
I want some chow.

344
00:36:13,832 --> 00:36:15,708
We sing for a bit, then we eat.

345
00:36:16,001 --> 00:36:19,712
Singing alone's like begging.
With you, it's a show.

346
00:36:24,009 --> 00:36:25,217
I want to sing there.

347
00:36:36,855 --> 00:36:37,855
Hey you!

348
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:40,858
You can't sing in the street.

349
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:42,693
Is that so?

350
00:36:43,278 --> 00:36:45,029
- How old are you?
- Twenty.

351
00:36:45,447 --> 00:36:46,613
What's that?

352
00:36:47,699 --> 00:36:49,450
She barely had a sip.

353
00:36:50,285 --> 00:36:51,076
Come here.

354
00:36:52,203 --> 00:36:53,162
You know "Du Gris"?

355
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,706
- Oh Mister...
- Shut your trap!

356
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:58,417
If you sing it, I'll let you go.

357
00:36:58,668 --> 00:37:01,670
My beat's over there. I'll look the other way.

358
00:37:05,342 --> 00:37:08,802
<i>♪  Mister, could I have a cigarette?</i>

359
00:37:09,012 --> 00:37:11,805

00:37:12,015 --> 00:37:15,267

00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:26,070

00:37:26,321 --> 00:37:29,740
<i>♪  You can easily guess why</i>

Prefer working with me or the factory?

368
00:37:43,922 --> 00:37:46,673
I'd rather slit my throat

00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:26,078
Because I screwed you once,

449
00:42:26,287 --> 00:42:28,413

A sparrow...

487
00:44:45,176 --> 00:44:47,803
You call a sparrow a "piaf"?

488
00:44:48,054 --> 00:44:50,597

504
00:45:37,395 --> 00:45:39,604
I didn't finish knitting it.

505
00:45:39,856 --> 00:45:41,773
- I'm making a sleeve.
- Now!

506
00:45:42,024 --> 00:45:44,526
- It's sold out.
- All the more reason.

507
00:45:44,735 --> 00:45:46,570
She can't go on like a bum!

508
00:45:46,779 --> 00:45:49,573
Look, our star performer

Not now, hurry up.

to tonight's performer.

516

Meet the venerable Jean Mermoz.

555
00:49:10,524 --> 00:49:12,233
This is for you.

556
00:49:13,569 --> 00:49:14,527
Thank you.

557
00:49:15,029 --> 00:49:16,029
Come, Edith.

558
00:49:17,698 --> 00:49:20,450
You wowed them, you'll do it
tomorrow and every night.

559
00:49:20,993 --> 00:49:23,495
You must meet someone who'll help you.

560
00:49:28,834 --> 00:49:31,544
My name's Marguerite Monnot. I'm a pianist.

561
00:49:31,796 --> 00:49:35,215
If ever you need, I'd love to compose for you.

562
00:49:35,508 --> 00:49:36,257
Thank you.

563
00:49:36,675 --> 00:49:37,634
Come.

564
00:49:38,469 --> 00:49:39,427
Edith,

565
00:49:39,845 --> 00:49:42,055
this is Mr. Jacques Canetti.

566
00:49:42,264 --> 00:49:44,349
Artistic Director of City Radio.

567
00:49:44,558 --> 00:49:47,227
Miss, you completely dazzled me.

568
00:49:47,645 --> 00:49:48,520
Thank you.

569
00:49:48,938 --> 00:49:50,605
Please join us at our table.

570
00:49:51,232 --> 00:49:53,108
I can't stay. I have to run.

571
00:49:53,317 --> 00:49:55,151
What's so important?

572
00:49:57,154 --> 00:49:58,196
Thank you.

573
00:49:58,697 --> 00:49:59,697
What is it?

574
00:49:59,949 --> 00:50:02,033
Marvelous, marvelous.

575
00:50:10,501 --> 00:50:14,754
You better lay off,
or it's pow right in the kisser!

576
00:50:15,005 --> 00:50:17,382
You dimwit, we've been waiting an hour!

577
00:50:17,633 --> 00:50:19,926
Fuck off, you stingy bastard!

578
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,515
Fork it over.

579
00:50:40,906 --> 00:50:43,908
"The Little Sparrow"

580
00:51:18,194 --> 00:51:19,027
Miss...

581
00:51:19,528 --> 00:51:21,237
you're marvelous.

582
00:51:22,323 --> 00:51:24,949
My hand's going to fall off.

583
00:51:25,159 --> 00:51:26,576
Have more bubbly.

584
00:51:26,785 --> 00:51:28,828
I want the bottle!

585
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:29,996
Here.

586
00:51:30,206 --> 00:51:31,873
I told her to trust me.

587
00:51:32,082 --> 00:51:34,542
That's the power of radio, right, Coquatrix?

588
00:51:34,752 --> 00:51:37,378
Don't forget the magic of musical hall.

589
00:51:37,588 --> 00:51:38,129
Of course.

590
00:51:38,339 --> 00:51:40,882
Edith, I have something for you.

591
00:51:41,091 --> 00:51:43,259
- A song?
- Naturally.

592
00:51:43,552 --> 00:51:44,886
Raymond! Raymond!

593
00:51:45,387 --> 00:51:47,180
Mireille, call Raymond.

594
00:51:49,058 --> 00:51:52,936
Someone for you, Kid.

595
00:51:56,941 --> 00:51:58,441
The big guy wants to talk to you.

596
00:52:00,027 --> 00:52:02,528
This is Raymond Asso,

597
00:52:02,738 --> 00:52:05,740
writer, composer, performer, poet.

598
00:52:06,742 --> 00:52:07,992
I'll be back.

599
00:52:08,202 --> 00:52:09,953
I love your music.

600
00:52:10,537 --> 00:52:13,456
Yeah, I don't like your mug.

601
00:52:19,255 --> 00:52:20,505
I've seen you often.

602
00:52:22,132 --> 00:52:23,800
You must've been hiding.

603
00:52:25,427 --> 00:52:27,303
It's midnight, everyone up.

604
00:52:27,513 --> 00:52:29,222
Everyone stand up!

605
00:52:46,907 --> 00:52:48,199
You're an immense artist.

606
00:52:48,909 --> 00:52:50,368
I'm wearing high heels.

607
00:52:56,709 --> 00:52:57,750
Whenever you'd like...

608
00:52:58,544 --> 00:52:59,752
Call me. I'll be waiting.

609
00:53:20,733 --> 00:53:23,484
My Daddy Leplee!

610
00:53:24,153 --> 00:53:27,655
A toast to my Daddy Leplee, my savior!

611
00:54:40,187 --> 00:54:43,856
What about yesterday? Were you in, or...

612
00:54:44,066 --> 00:54:46,150
I was here, but didn't see him.

613
00:55:25,482 --> 00:55:27,733
You're a bird of ill omen!

614
00:55:33,782 --> 00:55:35,116
It's her fault!

615
00:55:42,416 --> 00:55:43,541
Are you the Little Sparrow?

616
00:55:46,587 --> 00:55:48,129
Follow me, please.

617
00:55:48,881 --> 00:55:49,881
What for?

618
00:55:50,257 --> 00:55:51,257
This way.

619
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:54,177
Let me through, please.

620
00:55:54,386 --> 00:55:55,219
This way.

621
00:55:55,596 --> 00:55:58,055
I'm talking to you!

622
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,975
- Are you mixed up with The Mob?
- No.

623
00:56:02,811 --> 00:56:04,061
Leave me alone.

624
00:56:04,271 --> 00:56:05,646
What about Henri Valette?

625
00:56:05,856 --> 00:56:08,774
And Georges, Johnny the sailor and Albert...

626
00:56:08,984 --> 00:56:10,234
never heard of them either?

627
00:56:10,903 --> 00:56:13,738
They're friends... they're not mixed up in this.

628
00:56:14,531 --> 00:56:16,908
Aiding and abetting is a crime.

629
00:56:17,242 --> 00:56:19,994
I'm not guilty! I didn't do anything!

630
00:56:20,496 --> 00:56:22,079
I've lost everything.

631
00:56:22,289 --> 00:56:23,498
Where were you last night?

632
00:56:23,957 --> 00:56:26,375
I told you, I was out partying...

633
00:56:28,378 --> 00:56:30,463
You scum, lousy rats!

634
00:56:30,672 --> 00:56:32,340
What you're doing is disgusting!

635
00:56:32,549 --> 00:56:34,675
This isn't the stage!

636
00:56:34,885 --> 00:56:38,346
It seems you have some unsavory friends,
like Albert.

637
00:56:38,555 --> 00:56:41,390
I don't know any of them, lnspector.

638
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,601
Sure. I wasn't born yesterday.

639
00:56:46,104 --> 00:56:48,648
- Hey Sparrow, a statement?
- Not now.

640
00:56:48,899 --> 00:56:49,982
Let her stew in her shame.

641
00:56:50,192 --> 00:56:53,819
Go back to the gutter, little bitch!

642
00:56:54,029 --> 00:56:55,363
Leave her alone!

643
00:56:55,572 --> 00:56:57,448
It's not her. Get it?

644
00:56:57,658 --> 00:56:59,367
Did you sing to get off?

645
00:56:59,576 --> 00:57:01,786
It's a funeral. Show some decency!

646
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:08,376
- One last question.
- Vultures!

647
00:57:08,585 --> 00:57:09,794
Clear off!

648
00:57:10,712 --> 00:57:12,547
Out of the way! Get lost!

649
00:57:12,756 --> 00:57:14,340
It's over. I'm finished.

650
00:57:14,883 --> 00:57:17,343
They dragged me through the mud.

651
00:57:19,179 --> 00:57:21,472
Forget it. It's old news.

652
00:57:21,765 --> 00:57:23,516
I didn't do anything!

653
00:57:23,725 --> 00:57:24,934
I know.

654
00:57:27,521 --> 00:57:28,688
Open up.

655
00:57:37,948 --> 00:57:38,698
What?

656
00:57:38,907 --> 00:57:40,241
Simone Berteaut?

657
00:57:41,368 --> 00:57:42,159
Yes.

658
00:57:42,494 --> 00:57:45,288
Miss Berteaut, you must come with us.

659
00:57:46,206 --> 00:57:48,040
What for?

660
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:53,129
Court order from the judge and your mother
to send you to a girls' detention home.

661
00:57:53,547 --> 00:57:56,340
Effective immediately.

662
00:57:56,550 --> 00:57:58,175
Get your things, please.

663
00:57:58,468 --> 00:58:00,636
It's not true. She stays here!

664
00:58:00,846 --> 00:58:02,430
I have nothing to say to you.

665
00:58:03,765 --> 00:58:06,350
For the last time, get your things.

666
00:58:08,562 --> 00:58:09,979
You want to kill me!

667
00:58:10,647 --> 00:58:13,691
You want to kill me, is that it?

668
00:58:14,151 --> 00:58:15,693
Let me go, I said.

669
00:58:15,902 --> 00:58:17,194
She's not leaving.

670
00:58:17,404 --> 00:58:18,863
Momone!

671
00:58:19,072 --> 00:58:22,617
Edith, don't let them take me!

672
00:58:23,452 --> 00:58:25,536
My things! I have nothing!

673
00:58:25,746 --> 00:58:27,705
You hear, you bastard?

674
00:58:28,123 --> 00:58:39,216
Momone, no!

675
00:58:40,761 --> 00:58:42,345
Daddy Leplee.

676
00:58:45,015 --> 00:58:48,684
Oh, Daddy Leplee!

677
00:58:57,402 --> 00:59:00,071
You killed him! Where's the dough?

678
00:59:02,366 --> 00:59:05,284
What do you expect from a former slut?

679
00:59:47,536 --> 00:59:49,704
Everyone out of my dressing room!

680
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:51,664
Mamie, stay.

681
00:59:58,755 --> 01:00:01,966
I need a shot, it hurts too bad.

682
01:00:28,285 --> 01:00:29,827
Call the American.

683
01:00:35,125 --> 01:00:37,168
You can come in now.

684
01:00:42,466 --> 01:00:44,341
What a triumph. It was divine.

685
01:00:44,926 --> 01:00:45,968
Doug...

686
01:00:48,889 --> 01:00:50,055
I need some air.

687
01:00:50,515 --> 01:00:53,392
I want to go back to Chalons, with you.

688
01:00:55,937 --> 01:00:59,231
It's four hundred kilometers away.

689
01:01:00,484 --> 01:01:02,026
Go to hell, all of you!

690
01:01:02,778 --> 01:01:04,320
I've had it with you all!

691
01:01:04,529 --> 01:01:07,573
You're exhausted. It's a long journey.

692
01:01:07,783 --> 01:01:11,202
It's always no this and no that.
To hell with that!

693
01:01:30,472 --> 01:01:31,222
Let's go back.

694
01:01:31,932 --> 01:01:33,474
Turn around.

695
01:01:34,351 --> 01:01:36,602
Turn around! You spoiled it for me!

696
01:01:52,035 --> 01:01:54,036
Her blood tests are catastrophic.

697
01:01:54,329 --> 01:01:56,747
She has two broken ribs we can't set.

698
01:01:56,957 --> 01:01:58,207
It'll take weeks.

699
01:01:58,917 --> 01:02:00,376
If she has engagements,

700
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:02,670
cancel them, Mr. Barrier.

701
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:13,806
It's tight enough. Get away.

702
01:02:14,808 --> 01:02:17,518
Doctor, give me a shot so I can sing.

703
01:02:17,727 --> 01:02:20,646
Sorry, but my admiration has limits.

704
01:02:21,815 --> 01:02:24,024
Theirs has no limits, neither do l.

705
01:02:24,693 --> 01:02:27,444
Cancel. You're playing with your life.

706
01:02:27,654 --> 01:02:30,614
So? You have to play with something.

707
01:02:31,366 --> 01:02:33,993
You want a new life? Get a new you.

708
01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:36,745
- New what?
- New you.

709
01:02:38,248 --> 01:02:39,456
Why didn't you call sooner?

710
01:02:40,667 --> 01:02:43,961
I was busy. I didn't know
what you wanted with me.

711
01:02:44,671 --> 01:02:47,423
I saw you sing. You've a lot to learn.

712
01:02:48,425 --> 01:02:50,467
You're the first to say so.

713
01:02:51,052 --> 01:02:55,306
In three months no one will call you Kid.
Cabaret life's over.

723
01:03:22,083 --> 01:03:23,167
Badly.

724
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:27,379
You slur the words,

Slower, Marguerite.

726
01:03:31,593 --> 01:03:33,928
It's been 6 hours. Can we open a window?

727
01:03:34,137 --> 01:03:35,262
We'll breathe later.

728
01:03:36,598 --> 01:03:37,598
Again.

729
01:03:41,853 --> 01:03:45,773
<i>♪  He had bright blue eyes that flashed
like lightning. Like a storm...</i>

730
01:03:45,982 --> 01:03:48,943
You don't listen! You're not living the song.

731
01:03:50,987 --> 01:03:53,572
You have to be that woman in love.

732
01:03:55,033 --> 01:03:56,158
Think like an actress.

733
01:04:00,705 --> 01:04:01,747
He's mocking me.

734
01:04:01,998 --> 01:04:04,208
We're tired. We need a break.

735
01:04:07,003 --> 01:04:09,338
He makes me feel like I can't sing.

736
01:04:09,631 --> 01:04:11,632
Who do you think you are?

737
01:04:12,968 --> 01:04:14,802
You can't rest on your laurels.

738
01:04:16,179 --> 01:04:18,180
I started singing at nine!

739
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:22,434
It's okay. Don't worry.
This is new and difficult.

740
01:04:22,811 --> 01:04:25,396
You must become a performer, understand?

741
01:04:25,814 --> 01:04:27,231
Live the song!

742
01:04:28,692 --> 01:04:30,859
No one ever minded my diction.

743
01:04:31,236 --> 01:04:33,696
No one... like who?

744
01:04:34,739 --> 01:04:37,032
Creeps at Gerny's or on the street?

745
01:04:46,459 --> 01:04:48,752
Do what I say or go back to the gutter.

746
01:04:55,844 --> 01:04:57,761
Edith!

747
01:05:04,894 --> 01:05:07,938
To my little girl who never forgot her daddy.

748
01:05:08,148 --> 01:05:10,065
To the Kid!

749
01:05:10,275 --> 01:05:13,444
Heard you got a mentor. Does he have bucks?

750
01:05:13,653 --> 01:05:15,863
Not a cent... it's art for art's sake.

751
01:05:16,072 --> 01:05:18,615
Art for your ass's sake.

752
01:05:18,825 --> 01:05:21,035
Come on, Kid, sing something.

753
01:05:21,286 --> 01:05:31,920
Give us a song!

754
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:35,466
<i>♪  A woman that looks like a man</i>

755
01:05:35,717 --> 01:05:39,386
<i>♪  Stands no chance of making a killing</i>

756
01:05:39,596 --> 01:05:43,057
<i>♪  'Cos it's really the swish of her skirt</i>

757
01:05:43,266 --> 01:05:46,810
<i>♪  That makes any young lady so thrilling!</i>

758
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:50,773
<i>♪  When a fella hears this swish swish</i>

759
01:05:50,982 --> 01:05:54,276
<i>♪  What he'll dare do is amazing</i>

760
01:05:54,486 --> 01:05:58,155
<i>♪  His view of the world gets all rosy</i>

761
01:05:58,364 --> 01:06:01,992
<i>♪  With excitement, his pulse starts racing!</i>

762
01:06:02,202 --> 01:06:05,579
<i>♪  Swish swish, swish swish</i>

763
01:06:05,789 --> 01:06:09,124
<i>♪  When she starts her little swish</i>

764
01:06:09,334 --> 01:06:12,795
<i>♪  Swish swish, swish swish</i>

765
01:06:13,004 --> 01:06:15,506
<i>♪  She's quite a dish...</i>

766
01:06:15,715 --> 01:06:17,633
That's the way to handle her.

767
01:06:18,593 --> 01:06:20,302
I let her get away.

768
01:06:22,305 --> 01:06:24,056
I was too good to her!

769
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:52,835
You're stiff as a poker.

770
01:06:53,628 --> 01:06:54,795
Lifeless.

771
01:06:55,004 --> 01:06:55,963
Like a champ brawling in the street.

772
01:06:56,172 --> 01:06:57,464
Performing is an art.

773
01:06:58,716 --> 01:07:00,634
Grab them with all you've got.

774
01:07:01,803 --> 01:07:03,178
You have great hands.

775
01:07:03,930 --> 01:07:04,888
Use them.

776
01:07:05,557 --> 01:07:06,598
Sing with them.

777
01:07:07,058 --> 01:07:08,267
Again, Marguerite.

778
01:07:13,356 --> 01:07:14,690
Put some life in it.

779
01:07:16,943 --> 01:07:18,068
Your hands, your hands.

780
01:07:22,031 --> 01:07:23,240
That's it.

781
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:27,494
- I feel stupid.
- Keep going.

782
01:07:38,464 --> 01:07:39,548
Put this on.

783
01:07:40,925 --> 01:07:44,428
People don't care about that.
They like my voice.

784
01:07:44,637 --> 01:07:48,015
How can you be so talented and so pig headed?

785
01:08:15,126 --> 01:08:17,544
- Open up.
- I'm going to throw up!

786
01:08:17,754 --> 01:08:19,129
What's up, is she drunk?

787
01:08:19,339 --> 01:08:20,464
No, she's panicking.

788
01:08:22,759 --> 01:08:24,426
The audience is waiting!

789
01:08:27,931 --> 01:08:30,182
For weeks you bugged me for this show.

790
01:08:30,391 --> 01:08:33,936
Get her on stage before there's a riot!

791
01:08:34,145 --> 01:08:35,479
She's coming.

792
01:08:36,981 --> 01:08:37,689
Edith...

793
01:08:38,316 --> 01:08:39,858
You have three minutes.

794
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:43,570
This isn't a cabaret, it's a music hall.

795
01:08:44,155 --> 01:08:45,864
What have I gotten myself into?

796
01:08:47,492 --> 01:08:50,369
It's stage fright. It's a good sign.

797
01:08:55,959 --> 01:08:56,959
Edith?

798
01:08:58,378 --> 01:08:59,378
Yes?

799
01:09:01,547 --> 01:09:02,631
This is it.

800
01:09:02,924 --> 01:09:05,008
This is what we've worked for.

801
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:07,094
You can't crack up now.

802
01:09:10,056 --> 01:09:11,598
Open this door.

803
01:09:12,934 --> 01:09:14,685
No, I can't.

804
01:09:17,355 --> 01:09:18,438
Open it, please.

805
01:09:22,944 --> 01:09:24,027
Stand up.

806
01:12:14,198 --> 01:12:17,492
Ladies and gentlemen, Edith Piaf!

807
01:12:25,126 --> 01:12:26,793
"Edith Piaf Triumphs"

808
01:12:27,003 --> 01:12:29,045
"Street Singer Makes It Big"

809
01:12:29,255 --> 01:12:31,631
"The Little Sparrow Premieres"

810
01:12:33,885 --> 01:12:35,886
"The First Man To Give Me a Hand"

811
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:40,098
"Piaf On Tour"

"Edith Piaf's sings at the A.B.C. Theater"

813
01:13:04,207 --> 01:13:06,291
"The Sparrow's Dead Long Live Edith Piaf!"

814
01:13:22,767 --> 01:13:24,893
"Do you know what it's like to hurry home..."

815
01:13:25,269 --> 01:13:27,479
"hoping to lean on the one you love,"

816
01:13:27,813 --> 01:13:29,314
"only to find an empty room?"

817
01:13:29,732 --> 01:13:31,525
"Waiting and waiting."

818
01:13:31,734 --> 01:13:33,902
"I know that empty room. Yes, I do."

819
01:13:34,111 --> 01:13:35,779
I can't wait to see you in the play.

820
01:13:37,323 --> 01:13:38,532
Heads up, Canetti's coming.

821
01:13:38,741 --> 01:13:42,035
The conductor has been waiting three hours.

822
01:13:42,245 --> 01:13:42,869
So?

823
01:13:43,079 --> 01:13:45,497
The premiere's in less than 48 hours.

824
01:13:45,706 --> 01:13:49,084
Know many people Cocteau
has written plays for?

825
01:13:50,127 --> 01:13:51,836
- Miss?
- Yes, Suzanne.

826
01:13:52,088 --> 01:13:56,091
Paul Meurisse called.
Dinner with Mr. Cocteau is at 8:00 pm.

827
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:57,300
You see.

828
01:13:58,052 --> 01:14:00,053
Ask him to come back at midnight.

829
01:14:00,263 --> 01:14:01,638
Are you sure?

830
01:14:01,847 --> 01:14:04,808
You're worse than Raymond. Do this, do that.

831
01:14:05,017 --> 01:14:05,809
Stop it.

832
01:14:06,018 --> 01:14:08,687
- She fired that pain in the ass!
- Stop it.

833
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:10,438
Shall I show you the gowns?

834
01:14:11,023 --> 01:14:12,566
Yes, the gowns.

835
01:14:20,283 --> 01:14:22,784
They're all here, Miss Piaf.

836
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:24,661
Careful of the pins.

837
01:14:25,329 --> 01:14:27,289
The simplest one, no collar.

838
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:34,254
A man's been calling...
He has something for you.

839
01:14:34,463 --> 01:14:36,298
- What's he like?
- A soldier.

840
01:14:36,549 --> 01:14:38,300
I said you couldn't see him.

841
01:14:38,509 --> 01:14:41,177
He's on the landing. It's awkward.

842
01:14:41,387 --> 01:14:43,013
Since he's here, show him in.

843
01:14:51,814 --> 01:14:52,897
Follow me.

844
01:14:55,234 --> 01:14:56,234
Put it there.

845
01:15:00,948 --> 01:15:01,781
Here she is.

846
01:15:01,991 --> 01:15:04,367
Much better with no collar.

847
01:15:05,453 --> 01:15:06,494
Well...

848
01:15:07,246 --> 01:15:10,290
My name's Michel Emer, I'm a corporal.

849
01:15:10,499 --> 01:15:12,584
This isn't the army. What do you want?

850
01:15:16,881 --> 01:15:18,131
I have a song for you.

851
01:15:18,466 --> 01:15:21,217
Another? I have plenty.

852
01:15:21,427 --> 01:15:23,470
I premiere at the Bobino in two days.

853
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:25,013
I'll take this one.

854
01:15:25,348 --> 01:15:26,765
I go to the front tomorrow.

855
01:15:31,437 --> 01:15:33,563
There's the piano. You have five minutes.

856
01:15:38,819 --> 01:15:39,778
Edith...

857
01:15:43,115 --> 01:15:44,491
We'll have to wait.

858
01:15:51,624 --> 01:15:55,919
<i>♪  The hooker's quite a looker,

866
01:16:22,863 --> 01:16:23,905
Stop.

867
01:16:26,242 --> 01:16:27,242
I want it.

868
01:16:28,119 --> 01:16:29,327
Everybody out.

869
01:16:29,578 --> 01:16:34,332
You can't do this. We're already late.

870
01:16:34,542 --> 01:16:35,875
What can't she do?

871
01:16:36,293 --> 01:16:38,628
Play it. I want it for the Bobino.

872
01:16:39,505 --> 01:16:40,463
Get moving.

873
01:16:43,092 --> 01:16:44,300
You can't do this.

874
01:16:44,510 --> 01:16:48,304
I can't? Then what's the point
of being Edith Piaf?

875
01:16:56,981 --> 01:16:58,440
In French, please.

876
01:16:58,649 --> 01:17:01,025
She's too desperate, too poor...

877
01:17:01,610 --> 01:17:03,111
Spit it out, Charles.

878
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:04,195
I'm not a translator.

879
01:17:05,531 --> 01:17:07,532
Pathetic.

880
01:17:07,783 --> 01:17:11,161
Not in the tradition of
the French Cancan and Gay Paree.

881
01:17:11,704 --> 01:17:12,912
A complete flop.

882
01:17:13,164 --> 01:17:16,332
It's not the first time you've had to fight.

883
01:17:17,168 --> 01:17:20,336
Americans want beauties, not me.

884
01:17:20,546 --> 01:17:23,548
I'm not the Parisian bombshell they expected.

885
01:17:23,758 --> 01:17:25,800
Can you see me as a chorus girl?

886
01:17:26,010 --> 01:17:28,511
Where's my feather up the ass!

887
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:38,438
Go on laugh. I don't connect with them.

888
01:17:38,647 --> 01:17:40,774
I'm too sad, they're too dumb.

889
01:17:40,983 --> 01:17:42,525
Yeah, too dumb.

890
01:17:51,994 --> 01:17:53,328
You're on the front page.

891
01:17:53,537 --> 01:17:54,496
Two columns.

892
01:18:10,179 --> 01:18:12,013
It's Greek to me, translate this shit.

893
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:16,559
He says they shouldn't let you go.

894
01:18:16,769 --> 01:18:18,770
It would be a grave mistake.

895
01:18:18,979 --> 01:18:21,815
The Americans don't deserve you.

896
01:18:22,650 --> 01:18:25,985
I knew something would happen!
I must get changed.

897
01:18:26,195 --> 01:18:27,904
Ginou, help me choose a dress.

898
01:18:30,282 --> 01:18:32,992
Tonight I'm going out. I have a date.

899
01:18:47,716 --> 01:18:48,842
What's this, Marcel?

900
01:18:49,051 --> 01:18:50,885
Beef... Go on, taste it.

901
01:18:53,973 --> 01:18:55,181
It smells like a wet dog.

902
01:18:59,895 --> 01:19:00,603
What?

903
01:19:07,236 --> 01:19:09,445
Your English is as good as the meat.

904
01:19:17,162 --> 01:19:18,454
Don't like the place?

905
01:19:19,874 --> 01:19:22,542
I'm a bit surprised. I didn't expect...

906
01:19:23,627 --> 01:19:26,212
When you called to invite me out and said

907
01:19:26,422 --> 01:19:28,631
we were two Frenchies alone in New York,

908
01:19:28,841 --> 01:19:30,758
why not go out to eat,

909
01:19:31,719 --> 01:19:33,845
I imagined something different.

910
01:19:34,597 --> 01:19:35,889
It's my local spot.

911
01:19:39,894 --> 01:19:42,854
You sure know how to spoil a girl.

912
01:19:57,119 --> 01:19:58,661
Two pastrami sandwiches...

913
01:19:58,871 --> 01:19:59,954
Oh no!

914
01:20:00,706 --> 01:20:03,958
I'll handle this. Two tournedos Rossini,

915
01:20:04,168 --> 01:20:08,254
and a bottle of Chateau Langelus 1938.
Please.

916
01:20:12,801 --> 01:20:14,135
You must be starving.

917
01:20:15,012 --> 01:20:17,055
Better that than boiled dog meat.

918
01:20:18,349 --> 01:20:19,390
I'm sorry.

919
01:20:20,267 --> 01:20:22,852
Let's start over. Okay?

920
01:20:24,897 --> 01:20:27,023
How long have you been in New York?

921
01:20:27,691 --> 01:20:28,900
Eight weeks.

922
01:20:29,568 --> 01:20:30,818
Do you like America?

923
01:20:32,029 --> 01:20:33,696
I couldn't care less about America.

924
01:20:34,114 --> 01:20:36,491
I don't get them, and they don't get me.

925
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:39,118
- You must miss Paris.
- Terribly.

926
01:20:39,453 --> 01:20:42,288
What do you do when you're not singing?

927
01:20:42,873 --> 01:20:46,542
You could be a police investigator.

928
01:20:47,211 --> 01:20:48,378
I knit.

929
01:20:49,254 --> 01:20:51,923
Tell me your size, I'll knit you a sweater.

930
01:20:52,174 --> 01:20:54,092
No thanks, really...

931
01:20:56,637 --> 01:20:58,429
Those people recognize you.

932
01:20:58,639 --> 01:20:59,639
Really?

933
01:21:02,643 --> 01:21:07,647
They're saying that chump lost
his last two fights. He's washed up.

934
01:21:07,898 --> 01:21:09,107
I'll shut them up good.

935
01:21:09,316 --> 01:21:10,233
No!

936
01:21:11,610 --> 01:21:14,112
Don't get worked up. I was kidding.

937
01:21:26,667 --> 01:21:27,625
Very good.

938
01:21:38,846 --> 01:21:40,221
Let's not be so formal.

939
01:21:40,431 --> 01:21:41,472
Of course.

940
01:21:42,641 --> 01:21:44,350
And when you're not boxing?

941
01:21:44,601 --> 01:21:46,269
I train, I run.

942
01:21:46,770 --> 01:21:47,895
And after training?

943
01:21:48,105 --> 01:21:51,691
When I'm home in Morocco, I work on my farm.

944
01:21:52,276 --> 01:21:53,693
You have a farm!

945
01:21:54,737 --> 01:21:56,404
I raise pigs.

946
01:22:01,618 --> 01:22:02,201
What?

947
01:22:02,411 --> 01:22:03,411
Why not?

948
01:22:06,874 --> 01:22:08,332
It's true, why not?

949
01:22:08,751 --> 01:22:12,128
It's a lovely farm...
very modern with fine fat pigs.

950
01:22:12,379 --> 01:22:13,629
Who works it when you box?

951
01:22:13,839 --> 01:22:15,006
My wife.

952
01:22:23,807 --> 01:22:24,891
You have...

953
01:22:26,518 --> 01:22:28,019
magnificent hands.

954
01:22:30,564 --> 01:22:31,731
<i>Did you hear that Momone?</i>

955
01:22:32,524 --> 01:22:33,941
<i>It's true. You do have pretty fingers.</i>

956
01:22:36,403 --> 01:22:37,320
<i>Listen.</i>

957
01:22:38,030 --> 01:22:39,363
What color are your eyes?

958
01:22:40,574 --> 01:22:42,992
He leaned over to have a closer look.

959
01:22:43,202 --> 01:22:44,494
And his breath stunk!

960
01:22:44,953 --> 01:22:46,204
You can be such a jerk.

961
01:22:46,413 --> 01:22:48,206
He is a pig farmer after all.

962
01:22:48,415 --> 01:22:49,540
He said...

963
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:51,209
Violet blue.

964
01:22:51,627 --> 01:22:53,002
Of course, violet blue.

965
01:22:53,921 --> 01:22:55,630
<i>It was the way he said it.</i>

966
01:22:56,256 --> 01:22:57,840
He seemed like a child.

967
01:22:59,635 --> 01:23:00,760
Then he said...

968
01:23:01,512 --> 01:23:02,970
<i>You look like a magical fairy.</i>

969
01:23:04,681 --> 01:23:06,182
That's a bit much.

970
01:23:36,004 --> 01:23:37,088
<i>Did you kiss him?</i>

971
01:23:37,965 --> 01:23:39,173
<i>I didn't dare.</i>

972
01:23:40,968 --> 01:23:43,344
- It was a very lovely evening.
- Too short.

973
01:23:46,849 --> 01:23:48,141
Will you watch me fight?

974
01:23:48,976 --> 01:23:50,434
Of course.

975
01:23:52,813 --> 01:23:54,605
Did he try to kiss you?

976
01:23:55,774 --> 01:23:57,692
Don't know if it crossed his mind.

977
01:23:58,986 --> 01:24:00,403
<i>Yeah sure. I believe that.</i>

978
01:24:00,654 --> 01:24:01,946
I'll come hear you sing.

979
01:24:05,617 --> 01:24:08,578
Well... Good night.

980
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,750
<i>He's the love of my life!</i>

981
01:25:48,178 --> 01:25:50,388
You were wonderful!

982
01:25:50,597 --> 01:25:54,392
Mr. Lucien Roupp who is Mr. Cerdan's manager.

983
01:25:55,227 --> 01:25:56,477
Mr. Jameson

984
01:25:56,937 --> 01:25:58,813
from CBS television network...

985
01:26:13,954 --> 01:26:15,079
Marlene...

986
01:26:18,583 --> 01:26:22,545
Good evening. I'm sorry.
I simply wanted to have a word.

987
01:26:25,382 --> 01:26:27,633
I haven't been to Paris in ages.

988
01:26:28,552 --> 01:26:31,804
But this evening,
when you were singing, Edith,

989
01:26:32,389 --> 01:26:33,514
I was there...

990
01:26:34,433 --> 01:26:36,809
in the streets, beneath its sky.

991
01:26:37,436 --> 01:26:40,354
Your voice is the soul of Paris.

992
01:26:41,148 --> 01:26:42,898
You took me on a journey.

993
01:26:43,608 --> 01:26:45,234
You made me cry.

994
01:26:46,820 --> 01:26:48,946
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

995
01:26:49,906 --> 01:26:51,324
Thank you.

996
01:27:29,988 --> 01:27:31,155
Come on up.

997
01:27:37,788 --> 01:27:39,497
I'm starting to like this city.

998
01:27:40,248 --> 01:27:42,208
The stars are out tonight.

999
01:27:43,210 --> 01:27:44,752
Let's go.

1000
01:28:00,310 --> 01:28:01,185
Marc,

1001
01:28:01,603 --> 01:28:03,562
do you know how long a frog lives?

1002
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:06,857
In fairytales or in life?

1003
01:28:10,112 --> 01:28:13,656
I've never read fairytales... to anyone.

1004
01:28:14,408 --> 01:28:16,075
You haven't had the opportunity.

1005
01:28:18,078 --> 01:28:20,788
Yes, but still, I never have.

1006
01:28:49,812 --> 01:28:52,335

01:29:54,591 --> 01:29:56,342
Excuse me. I'm a bit tired.

1029
01:29:58,261 --> 01:29:59,261
I'll be back.

1030
01:30:19,824 --> 01:30:20,908
Lay her down there.

1031
01:30:29,376 --> 01:30:30,209
I'm going back.

1032
01:30:30,418 --> 01:30:31,585
It's out of the question.

1033
01:30:32,045 --> 01:30:33,921
Nobody tells me when to stop!

1034
01:30:34,965 --> 01:30:35,881
What do we do?

1035
01:30:36,174 --> 01:30:38,676
I'm sorry. Have everyone leave.

1036
01:30:39,094 --> 01:30:41,136
- I'm going back!
- No, Edith!

1037
01:30:41,513 --> 01:30:42,388
I must go on.

1038
01:30:42,597 --> 01:30:43,722
It's suicide.

1039
01:30:44,266 --> 01:30:45,349
She must be hospitalized.

1040
01:30:45,559 --> 01:30:50,563
No! Louis, I'm begging you!

1041
01:30:50,814 --> 01:30:53,649
You were just in the hospital three weeks ago.

1042
01:30:53,858 --> 01:30:55,484
There will be other galas.

1043
01:30:56,695 --> 01:30:59,738
Take me back on stage!

1044
01:31:00,407 --> 01:31:02,575
Take me back. I must sing!

1045
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:05,786
I must sing, Louis. I have no choice!

1046
01:31:07,038 --> 01:31:09,290
Edith, please.

1047
01:31:10,458 --> 01:31:12,918
- Do You hear them?
- Stop...

1048
01:31:14,462 --> 01:31:15,671
Close that door!

1049
01:31:16,339 --> 01:31:17,965
Take me back, Louis.

1050
01:31:18,550 --> 01:31:22,094
Take me back. If I don't sing tonight...

1051
01:31:22,929 --> 01:31:25,931
if I don't sing at least one song,

1052
01:31:26,141 --> 01:31:29,643
I'll lose all faith in myself.
Do you understand?

1053
01:31:45,118 --> 01:31:46,410
Doctor,

1054
01:31:48,079 --> 01:31:49,246
do what you must.

1055
01:32:16,149 --> 01:32:18,984
Not this time, you guys.

1056
01:32:19,778 --> 01:32:22,821
You expect me to fall on my face,
I'm in great shape.

1057
01:32:23,448 --> 01:32:26,158
Tell your papers it's not my suicide tour!

1058
01:32:31,623 --> 01:32:32,873
Padam.

1059
01:32:42,570 --> 01:32:45,270
<i>♪  Padam, padam, padam</i>

1060
01:32:46,100 --> 01:32:49,400
<i>♪  It comes running up behind me</i>

1061
01:32:50,540 --> 01:32:53,040
<i>♪  Padam, padam, padam</i>

1062
01:32:53,864 --> 01:32:57,164
<i>♪  It tricks me into remembering</i>

1063
01:32:57,888 --> 01:33:00,688
<i>♪  Padam, padam, padam</i>

1064
01:33:01,512 --> 01:33:03,612
<i>♪  It's a tune that points me...</i>

1065
01:34:03,757 --> 01:34:06,675
<i>Saint Theresa, first of all thank you...</i>

1066
01:34:08,011 --> 01:34:10,512
<i>I know you're behind all this.</i>

1067
01:34:10,847 --> 01:34:12,723
<i>You sent him to me.</i>

1068
01:34:13,933 --> 01:34:17,436
<i>I've found love, and I know it's your doing.</i>

1069
01:34:18,438 --> 01:34:21,690
<i>Sweet Jesus, protect Marcel.</i>

1070
01:35:38,351 --> 01:35:39,560
Go, Marcel!

1071
01:35:42,021 --> 01:35:43,021
Go now!

1072
01:35:43,648 --> 01:35:44,857
It's too soon, Edith.

1073
01:35:45,066 --> 01:35:46,942
No, he'll win. I feel it.

1074
01:35:47,151 --> 01:35:49,736
- If there's a problem, you'll look bad.
- What problem?

1075
01:35:52,365 --> 01:35:55,075
If there's a problem, I'll call you. Now go.

1076
01:36:07,630 --> 01:36:08,672
Hurry up!

1077
01:36:25,273 --> 01:36:30,444
Go, Marcel!

1078
01:36:43,499 --> 01:36:45,417
One round!

1079
01:37:00,725 --> 01:37:02,184
Go on, Marcel!

1080
01:37:06,731 --> 01:37:08,482
Kill him!

1081
01:37:47,063 --> 01:37:49,940
- What's happening?
- Zale's injured.

1082
01:38:18,011 --> 01:38:20,178
He did it? He's world champion!

1083
01:39:22,658 --> 01:39:23,992
You look like an angel.

1084
01:39:26,537 --> 01:39:28,205
Not like a fairy anymore?

1085
01:39:35,630 --> 01:39:37,130
You are my champion.

1086
01:39:37,507 --> 01:39:39,633
I want you to be mine for life.

1087
01:39:40,718 --> 01:39:43,553
Nothing existed before you. It's all gone.

1088
01:39:48,768 --> 01:39:49,976
Stay with me.

1089
01:39:55,024 --> 01:39:59,194
<i>My beloved, yesterday before bed,
I crossed off a day,</i>

1090
01:39:59,403 --> 01:40:01,988
<i>a long day, but also short.</i>

1091
01:40:02,698 --> 01:40:05,867
<i>When the plane took off
it took with it my heart,</i>

1092
01:40:06,077 --> 01:40:08,537
<i>my life, my breath...</i>

1093
01:40:08,746 --> 01:40:11,873
<i>My sweet boy, my child, my love,</i>

1094
01:40:12,333 --> 01:40:14,042
<i>your scent lingers in my sheets</i>

1095
01:40:14,252 --> 01:40:17,129
<i>and my heart sleeps constantly</i>

1096
01:40:17,338 --> 01:40:19,339
<i>in the arms of sadness.</i>

1097
01:40:19,841 --> 01:40:20,715
<i>My Darling,</i>

1098
01:40:21,008 --> 01:40:24,219
<i>I love you. What have you done
to make me feel this way?</i>

1099
01:40:24,679 --> 01:40:25,679
<i>I miss you.</i>

1100
01:40:26,013 --> 01:40:30,100
<i>I'm blank, listless,
as though waiting for something...</i>

1101
01:40:30,810 --> 01:40:32,686
<i>Hold me close to your heart</i>

1102
01:40:32,937 --> 01:40:37,065
<i>and know nothing in the world
counts more than you.</i>

1103
01:40:37,733 --> 01:40:42,988
<i>- Return my heart to me.
- All of France knows about us.</i>

1104
01:40:43,197 --> 01:40:47,617
<i>When I'm in a restaurant,
they play "La Vie en Rose"...</i>

1105
01:40:47,827 --> 01:40:49,786
<i>When I see, my love,</i>

1106
01:40:50,079 --> 01:40:53,957
<i>how attached you are
to your wife and children,</i>

1107
01:40:54,375 --> 01:40:56,710
<i>I feel like going far away,</i>

1108
01:40:56,919 --> 01:41:00,922
<i>thinking someday you'll be grateful to me.</i>

1109
01:41:01,549 --> 01:41:05,594
<i>I can't have you all for myself,
and can't live without you.</i>

1110
01:41:06,179 --> 01:41:09,598
<i>God is my witness,
in this affair, I ask for nothing.</i>

1111
01:41:09,891 --> 01:41:11,933
<i>I'm ready to sacrifice all.</i>

1112
01:41:15,271 --> 01:41:17,063
"If one day life tears you from me,"

1113
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:19,524
"If you die or are far away"

1114
01:41:19,942 --> 01:41:22,319
"Though you may love me, I would die too"

1115
01:41:27,450 --> 01:41:29,034
In three months,

1116
01:41:29,952 --> 01:41:31,494
that's right, in April...

1117
01:41:31,913 --> 01:41:33,371
I'll be a hit at the Olympia.

1118
01:41:33,789 --> 01:41:36,208
With a full house. We'll be flush.

1119
01:41:36,918 --> 01:41:40,545
Edith, your liver cells
are not functioning normally.

1120
01:41:40,755 --> 01:41:44,007
You've been ill. You need rest. It's serious.

1121
01:41:44,217 --> 01:41:46,843
I'm just 44. I'm not in the grave yet.

1122
01:41:47,053 --> 01:41:50,138
With the cancellations,
we have no more assets.

1123
01:41:50,348 --> 01:41:52,432
You're saying it's my fault.

1124
01:41:52,642 --> 01:41:56,228
That's not it, Edith. It's the tax authority.

1125
01:41:56,479 --> 01:41:59,189
We owe 120,000 francs as a first installment.

1126
01:41:59,982 --> 01:42:03,151
It's jaundice! I don't need
to convalesce for 100 years.

1127
01:42:03,361 --> 01:42:04,736
Don't get carried away.

1128
01:42:06,530 --> 01:42:08,657
I want to perform at the Olympia!

1129
01:42:15,706 --> 01:42:16,790
<i>Anything else?</i>

1130
01:42:17,208 --> 01:42:19,960
<i>Yes, we must stop giving in to her.</i>

1131
01:42:20,169 --> 01:42:22,545
I can't always keep an eye on her.

1132
01:42:22,838 --> 01:42:24,798
She left the hospital too soon.

1133
01:42:25,091 --> 01:42:29,052
The Olympia in three months...
It's a disaster waiting to happen.

1134
01:42:29,262 --> 01:42:30,887
She needs these challenges.

1135
01:42:31,389 --> 01:42:32,973
Not losing propositions.

1136
01:42:33,349 --> 01:42:36,518
When I am the one who had to tell
the insurers it's all cancelled.

1137
01:42:37,478 --> 01:42:39,562
We must decide for her, that's final.

1138
01:42:39,772 --> 01:42:41,064
Whether she likes it or not.

1139
01:43:12,013 --> 01:43:13,346
Edith...

1140
01:43:35,578 --> 01:43:38,580
I said to myself, Edith it's all over!

1141
01:43:39,123 --> 01:43:40,999
He's got someone else. You lost him.

1142
01:43:41,208 --> 01:43:42,167
He was having an affair?

1143
01:43:42,835 --> 01:43:45,462
Would I be telling you this if he were?

1144
01:43:46,297 --> 01:43:48,256
After he left the restaurant,
I followed him.

1145
01:43:48,883 --> 01:43:50,383
My Marcel crossed all of New York

1146
01:43:50,593 --> 01:43:55,138
to eat with an old blind black boxer

1147
01:43:55,348 --> 01:43:58,725
he had met a few years earlier. Imagine that.

1148
01:43:59,977 --> 01:44:02,228
Guys like that are hard to come by.

1149
01:44:02,438 --> 01:44:03,980
My Marcel...

1150
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:07,484
My Marcel! That's all you talk about.

1151
01:44:08,235 --> 01:44:09,277
Nothing else matters.

1152
01:44:13,324 --> 01:44:15,075
But let me tell you, Ginou,

1153
01:44:16,243 --> 01:44:17,285
I'll never have him.

1154
01:44:18,621 --> 01:44:21,873
He'll never be mine.
He won't leave his wife and kids.

1155
01:44:28,089 --> 01:44:29,714
He calls her every single day.

1156
01:44:32,134 --> 01:44:33,676
I pretend not to notice.

1157
01:44:33,928 --> 01:44:35,428
I want him to be happy.

1158
01:44:38,432 --> 01:44:39,432
I'll be back.

1159
01:44:45,439 --> 01:44:46,898
I could've been Edith Piaf.

1160
01:44:48,025 --> 01:44:49,776
There's more to life than songs.

1161
01:45:01,872 --> 01:45:03,748
It's been too long, Marcel!

1162
01:45:03,999 --> 01:45:06,167
Call Orly. Catch a plane tonight.

1163
01:45:06,585 --> 01:45:08,920
A long boat journey would kill me.

1164
01:45:09,213 --> 01:45:10,839
I miss you, Marcel.

1165
01:45:12,007 --> 01:45:14,008
I can't be apart from you anymore.

1166
01:45:15,553 --> 01:45:17,053
Maybe I should go back to Paris.

1167
01:45:18,431 --> 01:45:19,264
Hold on.

1168
01:45:19,473 --> 01:45:21,558
I'm just Madame's lapdog.

1169
01:45:21,767 --> 01:45:22,976
Stop.

1170
01:45:25,396 --> 01:45:27,814
Rum, Coke! Whiskey!

1171
01:45:28,441 --> 01:45:30,233
Everyone treats me like shit,
around here.

1172
01:45:31,527 --> 01:45:33,319
Boozing it up in Belleville was better.

1173
01:45:37,032 --> 01:45:38,366
You've dropped me, Edith.

1174
01:45:39,493 --> 01:45:40,493
Enough, Momone!

1175
01:45:43,456 --> 01:45:44,998
Get her out of my sight.

1176
01:45:50,129 --> 01:45:51,421
I'll be taking the boat.

1177
01:45:52,923 --> 01:45:54,549
Here's to your career, Edith!

1178
01:46:00,514 --> 01:46:03,391
Please Marcel. Leave tonight. For me!

1179
01:46:55,778 --> 01:46:56,736
You sleep late when I'm not here.

1180
01:46:56,946 --> 01:46:58,780
Thank God, Marcel.

1181
01:46:59,615 --> 01:47:00,865
Thank you.

1182
01:47:11,001 --> 01:47:14,003
I'll make you some coffee. Don't budge.

1183
01:47:21,136 --> 01:47:22,512
Let me serve you.

1184
01:47:40,447 --> 01:47:41,781
What are you doing there?

1185
01:48:00,467 --> 01:48:02,010
I knew you'd come!

1186
01:48:04,805 --> 01:48:07,307
Lucien had a rough time buying the tickets.

1187
01:48:13,188 --> 01:48:14,355
I have a present for you.

1188
01:48:18,068 --> 01:48:19,736
You're in bad shape.

1189
01:48:20,112 --> 01:48:21,946
You need sun. You're so pale.

1190
01:48:31,624 --> 01:48:32,707
Ginou!

1191
01:48:34,627 --> 01:48:36,919
Ginou. I'm looking for the watch!

1192
01:48:43,344 --> 01:48:46,262
What's gotten into you?
I'm looking for the watch!

1193
01:48:46,639 --> 01:48:49,265
It was here, in a long red Cartier package.

1194
01:48:49,475 --> 01:48:51,059
It was here, dammit!

1195
01:49:00,486 --> 01:49:01,736
What is wrong with you all?

1196
01:49:02,071 --> 01:49:05,573
I'm looking for Marcel's watch!
Where is that watch?

1197
01:49:10,704 --> 01:49:12,747
I'm looking for Marcel's watch!

1198
01:49:14,124 --> 01:49:15,166
What?

1199
01:49:16,794 --> 01:49:17,669
Louis?

1200
01:49:18,837 --> 01:49:19,962
What's going on?

1201
01:49:22,841 --> 01:49:24,717
You must be brave, Edith.

1202
01:49:26,220 --> 01:49:27,970
Is it Marcel?

1203
01:49:30,099 --> 01:49:31,182
What?

1204
01:49:34,186 --> 01:49:35,770
The plane crashed...

1205
01:49:50,536 --> 01:50:01,587
Marcel!

1206
01:50:12,141 --> 01:50:17,353
<i>♪  Come what may,</i>

1207
01:50:17,563 --> 01:50:22,275

01:50:22,484 --> 01:50:26,612

01:50:26,822 --> 01:50:29,657

01:51:19,208 --> 01:51:30,384
<i>♪  Those who loved before</i>

1216
01:51:36,934 --> 01:51:39,018
I don't know what else
to tell you Miss Piaf.

1217
01:51:40,729 --> 01:51:42,271
They say you're the best psychic...

1218
01:51:42,481 --> 01:51:44,023
That may be, but...

1219
01:51:44,608 --> 01:51:47,568
this is your third visit this week.
What more can I say?

1220
01:51:48,237 --> 01:51:49,529
Why keep coming back?

1221
01:51:51,865 --> 01:51:53,658
So that you can repeat it to me again,

1222
01:51:55,869 --> 01:51:58,287
for me to remember why I must go on living.

1223
01:52:00,082 --> 01:52:02,792
He died in the heavens,
so he must be up there...

1224
01:52:26,608 --> 01:52:30,236
Hey Jack Pills! Can you step on it?

1225
01:52:30,445 --> 01:52:31,779
I need some air.

1226
01:52:34,366 --> 01:52:35,491
That's lovely.

1227
01:52:35,701 --> 01:52:38,327
Step on it. Our pin up's melting!

1228
01:52:39,746 --> 01:52:41,664
I'll get a sore throat.

1229
01:52:41,874 --> 01:52:43,499
Then you'll take care of me

1230
01:52:43,709 --> 01:52:44,959
like a good husband.

1231
01:52:45,252 --> 01:52:47,420
The best hubby I've had.

1232
01:52:47,671 --> 01:52:49,171
The first you've had!

1233
01:52:50,591 --> 01:52:53,676
You plan on gawking at us all day?

1234
01:52:56,847 --> 01:52:58,306
I'm sick to my stomach.

1235
01:52:59,099 --> 01:53:02,393
Watch it, you'll ram us into the scenery.

1236
01:53:03,186 --> 01:53:06,230
Let me drive. Stop, I'll drive.

1237
01:53:06,440 --> 01:53:08,566
That way Ginou can throw up.

1238
01:53:13,947 --> 01:53:15,114
Go on, Ginou.

1239
01:53:16,450 --> 01:53:18,034
May I help Madame...

1240
01:53:20,495 --> 01:53:21,746
Go on, Ginou!

1241
01:53:22,581 --> 01:53:25,875
Very good. Bravo!

1242
01:53:30,923 --> 01:53:32,214
Bye Ginou.

1243
01:53:33,008 --> 01:53:34,634
Wait for me!

1244
01:53:38,722 --> 01:53:40,640
You sure know how to drive.

1245
01:53:43,352 --> 01:53:46,062
At least our outing wasn't for nothing...

1246
01:53:46,271 --> 01:53:48,105
We killed a tree!

1247
01:53:56,823 --> 01:53:58,824
Unbelievable, what shitty service!

1248
01:53:59,242 --> 01:54:01,243
Anybody here to take our order?

1249
01:54:02,704 --> 01:54:05,998
Calm down, dear. Don't play the star.

1250
01:54:06,208 --> 01:54:07,541
Tonight you play the Mocambo.

1251
01:54:07,751 --> 01:54:08,668
Really?

1252
01:54:09,044 --> 01:54:11,671
Remind me who's invited us tomorrow?

1253
01:54:11,880 --> 01:54:15,758
Marlon Brando, Ginger Rodgers, Mr. Chaplin...

1254
01:54:19,972 --> 01:54:21,138
What is that?

1255
01:54:23,308 --> 01:54:25,059
We never ordered that crap!

1256
01:54:36,571 --> 01:54:37,446
Don't touch me!

1257
01:54:37,781 --> 01:54:39,782
- Let me see.
- Don't touch me, I said!

1258
01:54:40,450 --> 01:54:41,867
Wipe yourself off.

1259
01:54:44,997 --> 01:54:46,622
We'd better get a divorce.

1260
01:54:51,878 --> 01:54:55,089
<i>How many injections per day, Madame?</i>

1261
01:54:56,425 --> 01:54:57,717
About ten...

1262
01:54:59,803 --> 01:55:02,555
Sorry to be so direct,

1263
01:55:02,806 --> 01:55:04,765
but why are you doing this?

1264
01:55:08,395 --> 01:55:10,062
So my body will shut up!

1265
01:55:14,317 --> 01:55:15,651
When did you start

1266
01:55:15,861 --> 01:55:17,778
these daily injections?

1267
01:55:18,655 --> 01:55:21,657
Five years ago, after the plane crash. I...

1268
01:55:22,325 --> 01:55:26,287
I was becoming arthritic.
I couldn't knit anymore.

1269
01:55:28,874 --> 01:55:31,917
You are seriously dependant.

1270
01:55:32,544 --> 01:55:34,086
An addiction...

1271
01:55:34,296 --> 01:55:35,546
Doctor,

1272
01:55:36,298 --> 01:55:38,674
I'd like my wife to go to rehab.

1273
01:55:41,845 --> 01:55:43,262
I want to get better.

1274
01:55:43,764 --> 01:55:44,805
I can.

1275
01:55:49,936 --> 01:55:54,148
<i>October 1960 - 5 years later</i>

1276
01:56:15,545 --> 01:56:17,296
Danielle, a chair.

01:56:27,432 --> 01:56:28,265
Edith...

1278
01:56:36,108 --> 01:56:37,149
Here, Edith.

1279
01:56:38,610 --> 01:56:39,693
Sit down.

01:56:50,705 --> 01:56:51,747
Bruno...

1281
01:56:57,879 --> 01:56:59,255
There'll be no Olympia.

1282
01:57:07,013 --> 01:57:07,888
I understand, Edith.

1283
01:57:20,443 --> 01:57:21,652
No!

1284
01:57:29,119 --> 01:57:32,788
I want you to meet Charles Dumont, composer,

1285
01:57:32,998 --> 01:57:35,499
and Michel Vaucaire, lyricist.

1286
01:57:35,709 --> 01:57:38,210
They've come back to play their song.

1287
01:57:46,887 --> 01:57:48,679

He came for you!

1316
01:59:52,971 --> 01:59:55,264

02:00:40,477 --> 02:00:41,643
stand up.

1323
02:00:47,609 --> 02:00:48,734

02:00:55,742 --> 02:00:57,284
We forgot it. I'll get it.

1327
02:00:57,577 --> 02:00:59,536
I won't sing without my cross!

02:02:19,951 --> 02:02:21,618
Go on. I'll handle it.

1332
02:02:27,083 --> 02:02:28,625
I'm afraid, Simone.

1333
02:02:29,377 --> 02:02:32,337
I'm losing my memory. It's very serious.

1334
02:02:34,257 --> 02:02:36,133
My thoughts are muddled.

1335
02:02:37,177 --> 02:02:39,845
I'm trying to remember...

1336
02:02:40,722 --> 02:02:42,264
but I can't.

1337
02:02:44,100 --> 02:02:48,061
Other memories are surfacing,
not the ones I want to see.

1338
02:02:51,483 --> 02:02:53,108
I wanted to see his watch.

1339
02:02:53,318 --> 02:02:55,777
Do you remember? Marcel's watch?

1340
02:02:55,987 --> 02:02:57,654
No Edith. I didn't know him.

1341
02:02:58,198 --> 02:03:00,407
I wanted to see his watch.

1342
02:03:19,844 --> 02:03:21,011

1344

1345
02:04:05,223 --> 02:04:06,306
Simone.

1346
02:04:06,683 --> 02:04:07,849
Yes, Edith?

1347
02:04:10,770 --> 02:04:12,229
I didn't pray.

1348
02:04:16,150 --> 02:04:17,943
I want to pray on my knees.

1349
02:04:19,529 --> 02:04:22,948
No one will reproach you
if you're not on your knees.

1350
02:04:24,117 --> 02:04:26,535
I want to pray for my daddy.

1351

Marcelle...

1352
02:05:35,438 --> 02:05:37,022
My little ghost.

1353
02:05:39,525 --> 02:05:42,110
Only Momone knows about it.

1354
02:05:42,320 --> 02:05:44,404
I need to tell you about my child.

1355
02:05:44,614 --> 02:05:45,656
Take it easy, Edith.

1356
02:05:45,865 --> 02:05:56,291
Marcelle!

1357
02:05:56,501 --> 02:05:59,920
Marcelle, go to bed. I've had enough today.

1358
02:06:00,129 --> 02:06:03,674
Think I can keep an eye out
for the cops and your kid?

1359
02:06:04,133 --> 02:06:05,926
What the hell's Louis doing?

1360
02:06:07,762 --> 02:06:09,262
It's him. Your father.

1361
02:06:14,102 --> 02:06:15,018
Did she eat?

1362
02:06:15,728 --> 02:06:18,313
<i>They said you were on the street with her!</i>

1363
02:06:18,731 --> 02:06:19,439
<i>Who said?</i>

1364
02:06:19,774 --> 02:06:22,776
<i>You get her twice a month and you screw up!</i>

1365
02:06:22,985 --> 02:06:25,028
I said not the streets!

1366
02:06:34,747 --> 02:06:35,747
Come quick!

1367
02:06:38,418 --> 02:06:40,168
It's Marcelle! Come on!

1368
02:06:44,006 --> 02:06:45,716
Marcelle's in the hospital!

1369
02:07:08,406 --> 02:07:09,531
Are you her mother?

1370
02:07:11,033 --> 02:07:13,618
Meningitis. Nothing could be done.

1371
02:07:14,120 --> 02:07:15,454
I'm sorry.

1372
02:07:50,531 --> 02:07:51,531
Edith,

1373
02:07:53,493 --> 02:07:54,785
I have the cross.

1374
02:08:12,220 --> 02:08:13,261
Hello.

1375
02:08:14,055 --> 02:08:15,931
They said you were on the beach.

1376
02:08:17,517 --> 02:08:19,518
Thank you for granting this interview.

1377
02:08:19,727 --> 02:08:21,061
My pleasure.

1378
02:08:22,814 --> 02:08:24,940
It's odd to see you so far from Paris.

1379
02:08:25,566 --> 02:08:27,275
I'm never far from Paris.

1380
02:08:28,861 --> 02:08:35,283
I've a list of questions. Just answer with
the first thing that comes to mind.

1381
02:08:38,579 --> 02:08:39,412
Well,

1382
02:08:40,540 --> 02:08:42,207
what is your favorite color?

1383
02:08:42,750 --> 02:08:43,625
Blue.

1384
02:08:44,418 --> 02:08:46,002
What's your favorite dish?

1385
02:08:46,504 --> 02:08:47,963
Pot roast.

1386
02:08:50,049 --> 02:08:52,717
Could you accept living a sensible life?

1387
02:08:53,261 --> 02:08:54,678
I already do.

1388
02:08:59,559 --> 02:09:01,518
<i>Who are your most faithful friends?</i>

1389
02:09:01,894 --> 02:09:04,145
<i>My true friends are faithful.</i>

1390
02:09:06,732 --> 02:09:08,775
<i>If you could no longer sing...</i>

1391
02:09:10,236 --> 02:09:13,071
<i>I could no longer live.</i>

1392
02:09:14,782 --> 02:09:16,157
<i>Are you afraid of death?</i>

1393
02:09:18,035 --> 02:09:19,786
<i>I fear loneliness more.</i>

1394
02:09:22,331 --> 02:09:23,248
<i>Do you pray?</i>

1395
02:09:23,583 --> 02:09:26,918
<i>Yes, because I believe in love.</i>

1396
02:09:28,296 --> 02:09:30,422
I don't want to go, Simone.

1397
02:09:31,257 --> 02:09:32,465
Where is Theo?

1398
02:09:33,384 --> 02:09:34,968
I want my husband.

1399
02:09:35,428 --> 02:09:37,637
Theo will be here in less than an hour.

1400
02:09:39,098 --> 02:09:41,349
<i>What is your fondest career memory?</i>

1401
02:09:42,977 --> 02:09:45,061
<i>Every time the curtain goes up.</i>

1402
02:10:00,870 --> 02:10:02,704
<i>Your fondest memory as a woman?</i>

1403
02:10:04,498 --> 02:10:05,957
<i>My first kiss.</i>

1404
02:10:08,461 --> 02:10:09,544
<i>Do you like night time?</i>

1405
02:10:10,171 --> 02:10:12,923
<i>Yes, with a lot of light.</i>

1406
02:10:13,341 --> 02:10:14,215
<i>Dawn?</i>

1407
02:10:15,259 --> 02:10:17,636
<i>With a piano and friends.</i>

1408
02:10:18,137 --> 02:10:19,179
<i>The evening?</i>

1409
02:10:19,889 --> 02:10:22,349
<i>For us, it's dawn.</i>

1410
02:10:28,272 --> 02:10:30,148
See, you're breathing.

1411
02:10:38,324 --> 02:10:39,908
I can't go back.

1412
02:10:44,538 --> 02:10:45,664
I can't.

1413
02:11:25,162 --> 02:11:28,999
<i>If you were to give advice to a woman,
what would it be?</i>

1414
02:11:30,209 --> 02:11:31,292
<i>Love.</i>

1415
02:11:32,044 --> 02:11:33,128
<i>To a young girl?</i>

1416
02:11:33,587 --> 02:11:34,587
<i>Love.</i>

1417
02:11:35,089 --> 02:11:36,089
<i>To a child?</i>

1418
02:11:37,591 --> 02:11:38,591
<i>Love.</i>

1419
02:11:41,846 --> 02:11:43,346
Who are you knitting for?

1420
02:11:45,725 --> 02:11:47,726
Whoever will wear my sweater.

1421
02:11:50,271 --> 02:11:53,857
That's all. I hope it wasn't too long.

1422
02:11:56,402 --> 02:11:57,569
Thank you very much.

1423
02:11:57,862 --> 02:11:59,571

1
00:00:03,367 --> 00:00:05,797
- Who you talk to?
- Shh! I don't know.

2
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:07,753
How you not know?
You is on the phone.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,491
Ah, I think it's pastor Nina.
She phone me, butt-dial style.

4
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:12,859
What pastor Nina butt saying?

5
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:16,229
I can't hear because someone
keep talking too much!

6
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:19,665
<i>Oh. Oh, yes.</i>

7
00:00:19,752 --> 00:00:21,734
Oh! I think I hear a man.

8
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:23,569
Maybe it's just a movie?

9
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:25,823
Ah, but they both laughing.

10
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:27,792
Frisky or normal?

11
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:29,794
Now it's quiet.

12
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:31,529
Frisky.

13
00:00:32,398 --> 00:00:33,882
- Now I hear talk.
- About me?

14
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,281
What they going to say
about you?

15
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,849
I don't know!
That's why I listen!

16
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:39,337
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

17
00:00:40,406 --> 00:00:42,388
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hello? Who is?

18
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:44,690
<i>Mr. Kim? It's pastor Nina.</i>

19
00:00:44,777 --> 00:00:46,359
<i>I must have dialed you
by mistake.</i>

20
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:48,778
Yeah. And we must have
answer by mistake.

21
00:00:48,866 --> 00:00:50,563
<i>Is everything okay?
I thought I heard yelling.</i>

22
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,899
Yeah. Everything fine
and, uh,

23
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:55,935
Not good to listen
to people conversation.

24
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:57,670
<i>You're right.
But I didn't know it was...</i>

25
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:00,273
Apology accept.
Enjoy you guest.

26
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,593
<i>- How did you...</i>
- Okay. See you. Bye.

27
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:07,331
You think she know
we eavesdrop?

28
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:09,300
<i>I'm still here.</i>

29
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:41,714
Stop nervous moving.

30
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:43,316
I'm not.

31
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:44,917
It's just all the big donors
are here,

32
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:46,511
And they have
a lot of influence

33
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,041
Over who wins
the Clark medal.

34
00:01:48,129 --> 00:01:49,166
They do?

35
00:01:49,254 --> 00:01:51,457
And isn't one of your photos
upside-down?

36
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:52,792
Oh, come on.

37
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,893
I thought you hung it?

38
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,579
I did.

39
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,448
Yeah, you is the same way

40
00:01:59,535 --> 00:02:01,200
When you was little
before piano recital.

41
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,635
But don't worry, Janet.

42
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:04,637
Your photos much better
than your piano.

43
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:06,105
I'm sorry. Do you mind

44
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:08,207
If I steal Janet away
to meet some alumni?

45
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,575
Yeah, yeah! Go schmooje.

46
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:10,877
I'll be right back.

47
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,978
Hmm.

48
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:17,416
Excuse me.

49
00:02:17,503 --> 00:02:19,118
Is there any meat
in those spring rolls?

50
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:21,002
Oh, no, no.
It's vegetarian, very good.

51
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,990
- Mmm. I'll have two please.
- Hmm?

52
00:02:25,244 --> 00:02:27,025
Oh.

53
00:02:27,378 --> 00:02:31,033
And a chicken skewer, too,
if possible.

54
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,364
Here you go.

55
00:02:33,452 --> 00:02:36,036
Thank you. And can you take this, please?
Thank you.

56
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,933
So, then,
Gerald doesn't notice

57
00:02:45,021 --> 00:02:46,412
The huge wine stain
on his collar

58
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,459
But keeps asking if there's
anything in his teeth!

59
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,617
It's funny because Gerald
is dumb, huh?

60
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:52,885
You know what's funny?

61
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:55,888
Nice lady at event,
um, Mrs. Taylor,

62
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:59,258
Mistake me for waitress
and make me serve her food.

63
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,294
What?

64
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:02,452
There was food?

65
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,795
She assumed you were a waitress
because you were Asian?

66
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,333
No, no, no.
I was standing beside food.

67
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,468
Lots of waitress
is Asian people.

68
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:10,536
Innocent mistake.

69
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:11,604
It was racist.

70
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,306
Ah! Innocent racist mistake.

71
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,874
Ignorant racist mistake.

72
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:18,311
You missing joke.
I was wearing same clothes as waitress.

73
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:21,447
No! It's typical
white, unconscious bias.

74
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,449
Hmm, happen to me all time.

75
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,567
- Really?
- Yeah.

76
00:03:25,654 --> 00:03:27,769
People mistake me for working
in the store every day.

77
00:03:27,857 --> 00:03:30,055
But you do work here.

78
00:03:30,142 --> 00:03:32,425
But how they know that?
See? Racist.

79
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,460
I can't believe you're not
more upset about this.

80
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,395
- Just the way life is, Janet.
- Not you.

81
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:39,231
Let it go. Enjoy your night.

82
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:41,318
Okay. We try.

83
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,376
This is the last of your stuff
from my place.

84
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:52,411
Mostly hair products
and colognes.

85
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,613
- My mango body butter in here?
- No.

86
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,283
I'm keeping the mango
body butter.

87
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,285
Friends said
this might get messy.

88
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:00,704
Tell your mom I say bye.

89
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,089
Okay.

90
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,590
Take care of yourself, babe.

91
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:06,359
Probably shouldn't
call me babe any more.

92
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:07,745
Baby steps, babe.

93
00:04:11,617 --> 00:04:13,733
Looks like splitsville's
got two new residents.

94
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,150
You think?

95
00:04:15,237 --> 00:04:16,653
The box of stuff?
The awkward hug?

96
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,471
Tale as old as time.

97
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:21,240
Well, Shannon is kind of
an awkward hugger in general.

98
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:22,827
Well, we'll know for sure
in a minute.

99
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:28,878
Yup. No look back.
Roll credits on that one.

100
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:33,285
I mean,
she's probably okay, right?

101
00:04:33,372 --> 00:04:35,488
She will be,
once I make my move.

102
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:37,975
Time to fly low
and buzz the tower.

103
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:41,378
What?

104
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,283
Hello?

105
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,909
Owner take such a long time
in the bathroom, huh?

106
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:59,879
Hello! You have customers here.

107
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,414
So inconvenient.

108
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,082
Aren't you the owner?

109
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:05,438
You think all Korean
is a store owner?

110
00:05:05,526 --> 00:05:06,899
No. I mean,
you're wearing slippers

111
00:05:06,987 --> 00:05:08,647
And you're always here, so...

112
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,301
Fine. Get out of my store.

113
00:05:11,855 --> 00:05:14,255
So it is your store.

114
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,129
Why you throw out customer?

115
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:19,665
Because he only see me
as a shopkeeper.

116
00:05:19,845 --> 00:05:21,378
You are shopkeeper.

117
00:05:22,042 --> 00:05:24,270
In Korea, I was a teacher.

118
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,891
Why people not mistake me
for teacher?

119
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:29,852
I wanted to be nurse.
No one mistake me for nurse.

120
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,846
Wanting to be nurse and being
nurse not the same thing.

121
00:05:32,948 --> 00:05:35,729
Ah, you hardly was teacher...
Just starting.

122
00:05:35,817 --> 00:05:37,516
Once a teacher,
always a teacher.

123
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:40,263
See? I just
teach you something.

124
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,065
Maybe it was
her comfortable shoes?

125
00:05:46,153 --> 00:05:47,417
I mean, servers love those.

126
00:05:47,505 --> 00:05:49,829
It doesn't matter,
and making excuses for it is even worse.

127
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:51,620
- You're right.
- I have to say something.

128
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,208
Just letting it go
isn't going to change

129
00:05:53,296 --> 00:05:54,934
- anything.
- I completely understand.

130
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,303
I mean, I could never
completely understand.

131
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,852
Although, I was once
offered change

132
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,571
While waiting for Chelsea
outside the bay.

133
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:02,699
Not the same thing.

134
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,562
Absolutely.

135
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:09,181
Oh, sorry.
I don't want to interrupt.

136
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:11,258
It's just I want to talk
to you about something

137
00:06:11,346 --> 00:06:13,285
That may or may not
be anything. I mean, it's...

138
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:15,454
I get a 15-minute lunch.

139
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,323
Last night, at the showcase,

140
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,391
A woman thought
my mother was a caterer

141
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:20,983
And wanted her
to serve her food.

142
00:06:21,071 --> 00:06:22,161
What did your mother do?

143
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:23,444
Served her the food.

144
00:06:23,532 --> 00:06:24,668
But she was upset?

145
00:06:24,756 --> 00:06:25,922
No, she was happy.

146
00:06:26,752 --> 00:06:28,400
So, does she
need a reference?

147
00:06:28,487 --> 00:06:30,302
No. 'cause she's not a caterer.

148
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,605
And people shouldn't assume
she is just because she's...

149
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,340
Serving food?

150
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:35,608
Asian.

151
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:38,210
Oh! Now I see.

152
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,846
I think an apology
of some kind is in order.

153
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:44,283
It's not 2016 anymore.
This stuff has to stop.

154
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,437
Of course. Did you see
who the woman was?

155
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:48,672
It was Mrs. Taylor.

156
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,458
It's about principles, you know.

157
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:53,858
You're right.

158
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:56,208
And we have a zero-tolerance
policy here at the university.

159
00:06:56,296 --> 00:06:57,512
But just so you know,
it's the Taylor family

160
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,942
That adjudicates
the Clark medal,

161
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,723
So that is something
to consider.

162
00:07:00,811 --> 00:07:02,693
Oh. Right.

163
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:07,089
Well, I just think people should
know when they do something wrong.

164
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,707
And I will absolutely
say something.

165
00:07:08,794 --> 00:07:11,377
But you can do a bad thing
and not be a bad person.

166
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:12,988
- Yes.
- And should one mistake

167
00:07:13,076 --> 00:07:15,381
Dictate who you are, forever?

168
00:07:15,656 --> 00:07:17,443
So I shouldn't
say something?

169
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,222
Sometimes not saying anything

170
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,896
Says a lot more than
saying the wrong something.

171
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,558
So I'm saying...

172
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:29,029
Something. Yes.
I think we have to.

173
00:07:31,006 --> 00:07:33,419
Yes. Final answer.

174
00:07:35,677 --> 00:07:37,568
Yeah, these are
the three we ordered.

175
00:07:38,693 --> 00:07:39,748
Pretty awesome, huh?

176
00:07:39,836 --> 00:07:41,863
Ah, they're so adorable,
it's sick.

177
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:43,263
The shipment
looks so much smaller.

178
00:07:43,351 --> 00:07:44,988
Yeah, since you made a switch
from big-swipes

179
00:07:45,076 --> 00:07:46,569
To turbo-towels,
you're ordering way less.

180
00:07:46,656 --> 00:07:47,770
Because they're quilted?

181
00:07:47,857 --> 00:07:49,872
- Yeah.
- Okay.

182
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:52,075
- Get a room.
- Or a lab.

183
00:07:52,162 --> 00:07:54,077
For all that chemistry.

184
00:07:54,164 --> 00:07:56,579
Turn down the heat on the
Bunsen burners, you two!

185
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,247
- What?
- Sorry. Ah, no.

186
00:07:58,334 --> 00:07:59,600
- Someone else.
- Oh.

187
00:08:00,602 --> 00:08:02,150
But it's great to see, you know?

188
00:08:02,238 --> 00:08:03,970
'Cause they work together,
so when they started

189
00:08:04,058 --> 00:08:05,118
Seeing each other
outside of work,

190
00:08:05,206 --> 00:08:06,707
It was pretty effortless.

191
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,715
Good for them.

192
00:08:08,911 --> 00:08:12,194
Yeah. Good for them,
good for... Others.

193
00:08:12,282 --> 00:08:14,063
Sure.

194
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,566
I mean, what's really
important is that

195
00:08:16,653 --> 00:08:19,902
Gwen was free
of all past relationships,

196
00:08:19,989 --> 00:08:21,571
As far as I know.

197
00:08:21,658 --> 00:08:26,909
Ah, true. Yes, Gwen is...
Was suddenly available.

198
00:08:26,996 --> 00:08:28,255
Right.

199
00:08:28,343 --> 00:08:30,286
Clean slate, ready to date.

200
00:08:30,374 --> 00:08:31,489
Great.

201
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:32,630
'Sup, Shannon. Got a sec?

202
00:08:32,718 --> 00:08:34,243
Omar! you kidding?

203
00:08:34,331 --> 00:08:36,661
Nothing I like more
than some secs with you.

204
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,563
Some seconds.
Seconds with you.

205
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,133
- Got it.
- And...

206
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,825
Not sloppy seconds... some...

207
00:08:41,913 --> 00:08:44,388
Some good old-fashioned
"time" seconds.

208
00:08:49,098 --> 00:08:50,872
Oh, hello, Ms. Murray.

209
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,642
Mrs. Kim,
you remember Mrs. Taylor?

210
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,435
Oh, yes.
Nice to see you again.

211
00:08:55,523 --> 00:08:58,224
I insisted on coming the
moment I heard what I'd done.

212
00:08:58,341 --> 00:09:00,088
I feel absolutely sick
about it.

213
00:09:00,175 --> 00:09:02,324
No, no, no, no!
It's easy mistake.

214
00:09:02,411 --> 00:09:04,760
I standing right next to
catering table.

215
00:09:04,847 --> 00:09:07,930
You are too gracious,
but it's not who I am.

216
00:09:08,017 --> 00:09:10,150
My daughter-in-law
is Sri Lankan.

217
00:09:12,922 --> 00:09:15,904
I'm just happy Janet is
doing good at school

218
00:09:15,991 --> 00:09:19,007
And she is finalist
for big prize.

219
00:09:19,094 --> 00:09:21,643
I think she might even win,
don't you?

220
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,111
Oh, we really can't say.

221
00:09:23,198 --> 00:09:26,248
Yes. Stiff competition
this year.

222
00:09:26,335 --> 00:09:28,902
But it's true.
She gonna win.

223
00:09:30,806 --> 00:09:32,154
Well, we certainly
wish you well.

224
00:09:32,241 --> 00:09:35,057
You and your husband
have a lovely store.

225
00:09:35,144 --> 00:09:38,045
Why you think I run store?

226
00:09:38,847 --> 00:09:39,828
Don't you?

227
00:09:39,915 --> 00:09:40,896
Do I?

228
00:09:40,983 --> 00:09:42,215
You were stocking cans.

229
00:09:43,352 --> 00:09:45,052
Yeah, I do.

230
00:09:47,356 --> 00:09:49,905
And a dollar from every roll
goes to "truth or bear",

231
00:09:49,992 --> 00:09:52,207
An organization that
rehabilitates wounded grizzlies.

232
00:09:52,294 --> 00:09:54,376
- That's funny.
- Is it?

233
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:55,786
Sorry, Kimchee.

234
00:09:55,874 --> 00:09:57,913
I just love how you can't
stop talking about her.

235
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,047
- Who?
- Gwen.

236
00:09:59,134 --> 00:10:01,083
You two really have
that spark, huh?

237
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,051
It's, like... boom! Fireworks.

238
00:10:03,138 --> 00:10:05,654
Yeah, our spark is pretty lit.

239
00:10:05,741 --> 00:10:08,023
But a lot of sparks
never spark into anything.

240
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,025
- Gotta put the work in.
- Ugh, boring.

241
00:10:10,112 --> 00:10:12,861
As soon as I feel it,
I go for it. No take backs.

242
00:10:12,948 --> 00:10:16,198
Gary in grade 8, rugby rick,
mason the mason,

243
00:10:16,285 --> 00:10:19,768
Guy I dated before Alejandro
whose name I can't remember.

244
00:10:19,855 --> 00:10:21,203
And how'd those guys
all work out?

245
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,038
Oh, you know. Good.

246
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,940
I mean, the bloom
goes off the rose eventually

247
00:10:25,027 --> 00:10:26,598
And sometimes very quickly.

248
00:10:26,686 --> 00:10:28,243
I just know
Gwen and I would never

249
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,178
Have made it this far
if we rushed it.

250
00:10:30,265 --> 00:10:32,714
- Huh.
- So, about these paper towels...

251
00:10:32,801 --> 00:10:35,050
Marcus! That's what
his name was.

252
00:10:35,137 --> 00:10:36,575
Wow! That was gonna bug me.

253
00:10:38,765 --> 00:10:39,946
What's wrong?

254
00:10:40,142 --> 00:10:42,858
It's my socks.
I'm wearing two lefties.

255
00:10:42,945 --> 00:10:43,973
How can you tell?

256
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:45,260
How can you not tell?

257
00:10:45,347 --> 00:10:47,162
Oh, Janet. A word?

258
00:10:47,249 --> 00:10:48,473
Sure.

259
00:10:48,561 --> 00:10:51,333
Just letting you know
the apology's been delivered.

260
00:10:51,435 --> 00:10:54,369
Wow. That's great.
Thank you so much.

261
00:10:54,925 --> 00:10:56,073
Was my mom okay with it?

262
00:10:56,169 --> 00:10:58,584
Oh, she handled
the situation very well.

263
00:10:58,672 --> 00:11:00,072
So, congratulations.

264
00:11:00,942 --> 00:11:02,504
Sorry?

265
00:11:02,604 --> 00:11:04,135
Well, it's not public yet,

266
00:11:04,223 --> 00:11:06,309
But it looks like
you're getting the Clark medal.

267
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,442
I won?

268
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:11,012
Ah.

269
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,841
So, just be sure to let her
know that it's a done deal?

270
00:11:15,731 --> 00:11:17,551
- Sure.
- Great.

271
00:11:20,282 --> 00:11:22,364
Found someone
wearing two righties.

272
00:11:22,451 --> 00:11:23,707
What are the odds?

273
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,311
Oh.

274
00:11:36,504 --> 00:11:39,247
You probably trying to see
what's on the shelf.

275
00:11:39,352 --> 00:11:40,733
- Not really.
- Hmm.

276
00:11:40,821 --> 00:11:42,436
It's a teaching degree.

277
00:11:42,617 --> 00:11:44,786
No, thank you.
Just these today.

278
00:11:44,874 --> 00:11:46,684
- I was a teacher back in Korea.
- Hmm.

279
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:49,926
But here, people think
I am just a shopkeeper.

280
00:11:50,014 --> 00:11:53,200
I know. People just see me
as a cleaning lady.

281
00:11:53,336 --> 00:11:56,263
Yeah! You's also good cook,
good mommy...

282
00:11:56,351 --> 00:11:58,233
And an excellent
ultrasound technician.

283
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,569
Yeah! Yeah? Yeah!

284
00:12:00,656 --> 00:12:02,137
What subjects did you teach?

285
00:12:02,224 --> 00:12:05,907
So many, hmm?
Geography, history, psychology.

286
00:12:05,994 --> 00:12:08,377
- My son, Javid, is struggling with math.
- Mmm.

287
00:12:08,464 --> 00:12:11,013
Do you think you might be
able to help him?

288
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,448
Yeah! I can help him
with, ah,

289
00:12:13,535 --> 00:12:16,136
Geography, history,
psychology.

290
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:19,021
And math.

291
00:12:19,108 --> 00:12:21,323
Wonderful.
Thank you so much.

292
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,747
No problem for teacher.

293
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,821
Okay, so, uh,

294
00:12:26,048 --> 00:12:29,684
Four can of noodle...
Adding tax is, uh,

295
00:12:31,905 --> 00:12:33,653
5.89.

296
00:12:34,156 --> 00:12:35,715
Like it says on the machine.

297
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,126
Yeah. Okay.

298
00:12:40,547 --> 00:12:41,722
Hey.

299
00:12:41,856 --> 00:12:46,014
So, I was thinking,
if you're free tonight...

300
00:12:46,101 --> 00:12:48,216
Yes. I mean no. Uh.

301
00:12:48,303 --> 00:12:49,951
I don't know. Why?
What are you thinking?

302
00:12:50,038 --> 00:12:54,222
Uh, well, if you're into it,
maybe we could see a flick?

303
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:58,060
And then grab a bevy?
Or some chow.

304
00:12:58,147 --> 00:12:59,327
Or a bevy and chow.

305
00:12:59,414 --> 00:13:00,862
Is sounding casual
always this hard?

306
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:03,582
No. I mean, I can't.
It...

307
00:13:03,723 --> 00:13:05,000
It all sounds great,

308
00:13:05,087 --> 00:13:07,614
But I-i need to take things
slow right now.

309
00:13:08,568 --> 00:13:09,949
Okay.

310
00:13:10,325 --> 00:13:12,374
- Yeah. I thought that we...
- We did. I just...

311
00:13:12,461 --> 00:13:14,209
I'm a rusher.
It's kind of my thing.

312
00:13:14,296 --> 00:13:15,944
Has been for a while.

313
00:13:16,031 --> 00:13:18,246
I end one thing and then
I rush into another thing

314
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,782
And sometimes I don't even
know the new thing's name.

315
00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:22,384
- It's Jung.
- Oh, I know.

316
00:13:22,471 --> 00:13:24,419
And that's what
makes this different,

317
00:13:24,506 --> 00:13:25,921
So I want to keep it
that way

318
00:13:26,008 --> 00:13:27,701
By breaking
my rushy rebound habit

319
00:13:27,789 --> 00:13:29,458
And just taking it slow.

320
00:13:29,545 --> 00:13:31,393
Well, how slow
are you thinking?

321
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,961
Think of it as a yellow light.

322
00:13:33,048 --> 00:13:35,063
Doesn't yellow turn red
before green?

323
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:37,117
- It does.
- Gotcha.

324
00:13:38,587 --> 00:13:40,881
But it's about the journey,
not the destination.

325
00:13:40,969 --> 00:13:42,996
- Mmm.
- Road trip.

326
00:13:43,084 --> 00:13:46,241
Vroom, vroom! Honk, honk!
Fun, right?

327
00:13:52,994 --> 00:13:55,413
Just wondering when
the owner is coming back?

328
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,067
Just give to me you money.

329
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,707
Thank you.

330
00:14:07,749 --> 00:14:09,316
Guess who won
the Clark medal?

331
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,032
- Me.
- Oh!

332
00:14:14,189 --> 00:14:16,705
Congratulation, Janet.

333
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:18,507
You see, Janet?

334
00:14:18,594 --> 00:14:22,514
Work and focus.
Even you can be successful.

335
00:14:22,998 --> 00:14:24,380
Thanks, umma.

336
00:14:24,483 --> 00:14:26,709
Is it also possible
that you might have used

337
00:14:26,802 --> 00:14:29,850
The Mrs. Taylor situation
to influence her decision?

338
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,401
What decision?

339
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,171
She judges
who wins the Clark medal.

340
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:36,509
Ah, no, no. You win,
fair and square.

341
00:14:36,603 --> 00:14:38,317
<i>- Yobo.</i>
- What?

342
00:14:38,427 --> 00:14:40,376
Sometime you sneak attacking
so good,

343
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:42,179
You not even know
you sneak attacking.

344
00:14:42,351 --> 00:14:43,732
What did she do?

345
00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:47,102
I tell Mrs. Taylor fact.
What's problem?

346
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:48,670
- Oh, god.
- Simple math.

347
00:14:48,757 --> 00:14:50,639
Innocent racist mistake,

348
00:14:50,726 --> 00:14:54,376
Plus Asian lady suggest
a daughter should win,

349
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,959
Multiply by years
of white guilt

350
00:14:57,144 --> 00:14:59,477
Equal Janet win award.

351
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:03,068
You welcome.

352
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,474
Hey, if you find a ring
in the car, let me know.

353
00:15:11,562 --> 00:15:14,644
- You lost one?
- No. I want one.

354
00:15:14,816 --> 00:15:17,569
Hey, Jung, do you mind bringing
the blue escape around?

355
00:15:19,075 --> 00:15:20,990
Jung?

356
00:15:21,422 --> 00:15:24,223
I'll get you an escape.
Or die trying.

357
00:15:25,099 --> 00:15:26,246
Did Jung hear you?

358
00:15:26,528 --> 00:15:28,577
Are you going to fire him?
Can I watch?

359
00:15:28,664 --> 00:15:31,980
It's fine.
It's a... Inside joke.

360
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:34,167
You got me, Jung. Ha-ha.

361
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,721
You can't walk past me
like that.

362
00:15:39,808 --> 00:15:41,556
Oh, I just wouldn't want
anyone getting confused

363
00:15:41,643 --> 00:15:43,491
About the pace of
our relationship, you know?

364
00:15:43,578 --> 00:15:45,260
Wouldn't want anyone
thinking that I would just...

365
00:15:45,347 --> 00:15:47,429
I dunno... drop everything
and move a car around for you.

366
00:15:47,516 --> 00:15:49,264
So you did hear me.

367
00:15:49,351 --> 00:15:50,684
Or it's just
a random example.

368
00:15:51,853 --> 00:15:53,435
Moving cars is your job.

369
00:15:53,522 --> 00:15:56,238
Yeah. And I'm taking it slow,
like you said.

370
00:15:56,325 --> 00:15:57,706
Or I could go slower.

371
00:15:57,793 --> 00:16:00,175
Fine. Slower the better.

372
00:16:00,262 --> 00:16:03,278
Super. You know,
maybe we could go so slow,

373
00:16:03,365 --> 00:16:04,379
We don't even go at all.

374
00:16:04,466 --> 00:16:05,714
Best thing you've ever said.

375
00:16:05,801 --> 00:16:07,949
- So it's decided.
- Oh, it's decided.

376
00:16:08,036 --> 00:16:09,793
- Great.
- Good.

377
00:16:11,035 --> 00:16:13,021
I'm sorry I said all that slow
stuff. I didn't mean it.

378
00:16:13,141 --> 00:16:15,457
- Please stop talking.
- Sorry.

379
00:16:15,544 --> 00:16:17,959
But if you think about it,
we really are going quite slow.

380
00:16:18,046 --> 00:16:20,195
Okay, want me to speed up?
Should I speed up? I'll speed up.

381
00:16:20,282 --> 00:16:23,231
No, no, no! Just mean we've
known each other for years.

382
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:24,340
So that makes this
way different

383
00:16:24,428 --> 00:16:26,192
Than all those randos I've
rushed it with before, like...

384
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,621
Oh, my god.
I forgot his name.

385
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:29,441
Okay, now you need to
stop talking.

386
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,435
Yeah, I'm gonna sweep
Shannon right off her feet.

387
00:16:32,694 --> 00:16:36,316
"Sweep". Just as I grab
a broom. That's a sign.

388
00:16:39,434 --> 00:16:40,691
Marcus.

389
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,053
Okay.

390
00:16:46,141 --> 00:16:49,624
Take power
of y times x square.

391
00:16:49,711 --> 00:16:53,762
Transfer zero,
plus math style,

392
00:16:53,925 --> 00:16:56,097
- And you get, ah...
- Wrong.

393
00:16:56,184 --> 00:16:57,999
What? How you know?

394
00:16:58,086 --> 00:16:59,157
'Cause it's what
you did before,

395
00:16:59,245 --> 00:17:00,540
And I heard Siri tell you
it was wrong

396
00:17:00,628 --> 00:17:02,222
When you asked her
in the bathroom.

397
00:17:04,426 --> 00:17:05,808
Okay.

398
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:09,024
Truth is I only teach math
one time

399
00:17:09,197 --> 00:17:11,212
To cover for friend
who have nosebleed.

400
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:13,248
My main subject is history.

401
00:17:13,336 --> 00:17:15,323
Yeah. Me, too.
'cause history's easy.

402
00:17:15,448 --> 00:17:17,118
- No!
- Face it, Mr. Kim.

403
00:17:17,205 --> 00:17:18,384
We're not math guys.

404
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:19,814
We've been at this
for like a million hours

405
00:17:19,902 --> 00:17:21,189
And haven't solved
a single problem.

406
00:17:21,276 --> 00:17:23,692
- Maybe you attitude is a problem.
- I don't think so.

407
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:26,995
<i>Yobo.</i> Oh, hi, Javid.
How it's going?

408
00:17:27,082 --> 00:17:28,667
Yeah! Good, good, uh?

409
00:17:28,772 --> 00:17:32,409
Lots of number, letter,
adding, subtracting.

410
00:17:32,503 --> 00:17:33,601
Oh, yeah.

411
00:17:33,688 --> 00:17:36,548
But, uh,
sometime is good to have

412
00:17:36,636 --> 00:17:39,174
A second opinion, uh?
For variety.

413
00:17:39,261 --> 00:17:42,143
If, ah, you is teaching,
what you do?

414
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,296
Oh.

415
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,082
Just use more number.

416
00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:49,102
Looking good. Nice work,<i> yobo.</i>

417
00:17:53,542 --> 00:17:55,190
Did I only win
because of my mom?

418
00:17:55,277 --> 00:17:57,192
Janet, so nice to
see you again.

419
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:59,556
- I need to know.
- You were already a finalist.

420
00:18:00,315 --> 00:18:01,730
I can't accept the medal.

421
00:18:01,817 --> 00:18:03,796
It's art, Janet.

422
00:18:03,884 --> 00:18:05,333
It's completely subjective.

423
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,135
A dart throw at best.

424
00:18:07,222 --> 00:18:09,104
Is an apple
better than an orange?

425
00:18:09,191 --> 00:18:11,139
Is a triangle
better than a square?

426
00:18:11,226 --> 00:18:12,240
I don't know.

427
00:18:12,327 --> 00:18:13,608
And I'm supposed to be
an expert,

428
00:18:13,695 --> 00:18:15,243
And Mrs. Taylor thinks that

429
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,479
Barnett Newman
is the pinnacle of art.

430
00:18:17,566 --> 00:18:19,743
He does stripes, Janet.

431
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:23,056
The emperor has no clothes.

432
00:18:30,145 --> 00:18:31,274
Hello?

433
00:18:31,362 --> 00:18:33,923
I've seen<i> west side story.</i>
I know how to fight.

434
00:18:34,516 --> 00:18:37,699
Terence. Hi.

435
00:18:37,786 --> 00:18:39,647
Just looking for
a customer's lost locket.

436
00:18:39,735 --> 00:18:41,624
But, uh, no such luck-et.

437
00:18:41,712 --> 00:18:43,171
- Want me to look?
- Not now.

438
00:18:43,258 --> 00:18:47,095
You're off the clock,
so don't go making me look bad.

439
00:18:51,585 --> 00:18:53,095
I forgot the light.

440
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:57,419
Ah, I can see
your head, Jung.

441
00:18:57,506 --> 00:19:00,021
Better not find that locket
before I do.

442
00:19:00,108 --> 00:19:01,174
Get outta here.

443
00:19:05,823 --> 00:19:08,472
- Here's Janet with medal.
- -mmm-hmm.

444
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,810
And here is medal on table
with no Janet.

445
00:19:11,898 --> 00:19:15,781
And here is a medal
from side view. And the...

446
00:19:15,869 --> 00:19:17,181
Hello, Janet.

447
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:19,447
Your mother's been telling me
all about the award.

448
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:20,883
Quite the accomplishment.

449
00:19:21,084 --> 00:19:22,220
Thanks, Mrs. Ada.

450
00:19:22,308 --> 00:19:24,697
- And here the medal from behind.
- Ah.

451
00:19:24,785 --> 00:19:26,618
But I couldn't have done it
without my mom.

452
00:19:27,486 --> 00:19:29,166
That's very sweet of you
to say.

453
00:19:29,254 --> 00:19:30,921
No, really.
She made them give it to me.

454
00:19:31,908 --> 00:19:34,595
Your family
has so many talents.

455
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,205
Mr. Kim.
Just the Kim I wanted to see.

456
00:19:41,293 --> 00:19:42,384
Yeah, yeah. I know.

457
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:45,556
I already tell Javid he need
to find better teacher.

458
00:19:45,654 --> 00:19:48,009
No. Javid has
never done better.

459
00:19:48,097 --> 00:19:49,078
He pass?

460
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,599
62%.

461
00:19:51,646 --> 00:19:53,384
So... You proud of that?

462
00:19:53,478 --> 00:19:56,064
Ah. Very clever of you
to pretend

463
00:19:56,152 --> 00:19:58,978
Not to know the answers
so javid would teach himself.

464
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:02,282
Yeah.
It's a old teaching trick.

465
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,384
Thank you so much.

466
00:20:03,472 --> 00:20:05,406
Okay. Bye.

467
00:20:07,914 --> 00:20:10,696
So, maybe we take
this down, huh?

468
00:20:10,784 --> 00:20:13,785
Yeah. Don't have to brag
about everything I do.

469
00:20:21,931 --> 00:20:25,024
Yo. Anybody home?

470
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,337
Uh, where you going?

471
00:20:31,425 --> 00:20:32,758
Oh, sorry. It's your store?

472
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,322
No.

473
00:20:35,492 --> 00:20:37,292
What they don't know
can't hurt them, right?

474
00:20:37,893 --> 00:20:39,541
Hmm. Hard to say.

475
00:20:39,629 --> 00:20:42,244
I could steal
this golf magazine.

476
00:20:42,482 --> 00:20:45,431
Then I'm happy because
I have a free magazine.

477
00:20:45,588 --> 00:20:48,571
But I'm also sad
because I'm stealing

478
00:20:48,768 --> 00:20:50,935
And I hurt owner of store.

479
00:20:52,137 --> 00:20:53,403
Yeah.

480
00:20:53,976 --> 00:20:55,306
- See ya.
- Oh.

481
00:20:58,319 --> 00:20:59,689
She pay for that?

482
00:20:59,777 --> 00:21:02,330
What do I know?
I'm just a customer.

483
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,197
Okay, then. Time to pay.

484
00:21:05,481 --> 00:21:07,470
- What?
- You is a customer.

485
00:21:07,646 --> 00:21:10,013
$10. For magazine and chips.

486
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,587
Still worth it.

487
00:21:16,314 --> 00:21:17,545
Where you going?

488
00:21:17,633 --> 00:21:18,978
Get my chip.

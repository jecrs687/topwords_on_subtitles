[creaking]

180
00:09:01,565 --> 00:09:03,065
[grunting]

181
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:26,894
[sighs]

182
00:09:26,938 --> 00:09:28,338
- [all crying]
- [alarm stops blaring]

183
00:09:28,374 --> 00:09:29,462
[computer chimes]

184
00:09:29,506 --> 00:09:31,006
[videogame music playing]

185
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,660
[all cheering]

186
00:09:34,249 --> 00:09:35,555
I knew you had it in you.

187
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:38,558
I'm so glad you had
them fingernails all nasty.

188
00:09:38,602 --> 00:09:40,647
You go, girl!

189
00:09:40,691 --> 00:09:42,344
You saved the planet.

190
00:09:42,388 --> 00:09:43,694
That's what's up!

191
00:09:43,737 --> 00:09:45,957
Yes, great job, Star.

192
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,613
Oh, you are making me feel so...

193
00:09:50,527 --> 00:09:51,832
special.

194
00:09:51,876 --> 00:09:53,486
- [waves crashing]
- [birds squawking]

195
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,370
Would you look at that.
That guy set the record

196
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:58,535
for crushing the most kumquats
with his biceps.

197
00:09:58,578 --> 00:10:02,016
That is a most
praise-worthy use for a bicep.

198
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:07,326
Sorry you didn't make it into The
Giant Book of Recorded Records, Star.

199
00:10:07,369 --> 00:10:08,936
That is the okay

200
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,809
- because I did make it into the book
- [glass shattering]

201
00:10:11,852 --> 00:10:16,509
of People Who Have Stopped
an Asteroid.

202
00:10:16,553 --> 00:10:20,426
[Beast Boy] This is you,
Superman, and Bruce Willis.

203
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,970
[all cheering]

204
00:10:22,167 --> 00:10:24,386
- [Beast Boy] That's what's up!
- [Cyborg] You kept them nails going.

205
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:27,150
Everybody told you they was nasty!

206
00:10:27,174 --> 00:10:29,174

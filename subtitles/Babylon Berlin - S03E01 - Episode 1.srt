00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,160
Previously on Babylon Berlin:

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,120
I will guide you to the truth.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,600
Gereon!

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,800
-Did you go to war?
-I followed my brother.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,440
I came back alone.
My mother never got over that.

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,800
For her, the wrong son came home.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,880
Anno was officially declared dead.

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,520
-And now?
-We're here if you want us to.

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,680
Lotte? Where have you been?

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,880
Everywhere.

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,200
-I want to join homicide.
-No women there.

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,440
-I don't do detective sergeants.
-Don't worry.

13
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,280
Let's settle the matter between ourselves.

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,040
What's the matter with you?

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,840
Get lost!
I don't want to see you again.

16
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,080
-Mr. Benda is not a murderer.
-He's the boss of the polit police.

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,920
No! Fritz!

18
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,160
That Benda of yours, it was his people.

19
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,720
Tell me what to do and I'll do it.

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,160
Fritz, what are you doing here?

21
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,320
You're mistaking me.

22
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,080
What's this, Daddy?

23
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,520
Do you recognise me?

24
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,720
Anno?

25
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,400
Stop! What are you doing?

26
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,520
You can't go out there.

27
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,120
Don't go out there! Stay inside, mate!

28
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,320
We want our money back!

20 SEPTEMBER 1929

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,280
-Why so many rolls?
-I don't know.

31
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,760
-Morning.
-Didn't he...

32
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,920
-Morning. When did you get home?
-Morning.

33
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,840
Late. Didn't want to disturb you.

34
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,080
Don't get upset.

REJECTED

37
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,360
You are very persistent in this matter.

38
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,200
It's my heartfelt wish, Madam.

39
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,320
Greta Overbeck and I are close.

40
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,840
She doesn't give us that impression.

41
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,920
-Why ever not?
-It doesn't say that here.

42
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,280
She expressedly refuses to see anybody.

43
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,680
In particular DS Charlotte Ritter.

44
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,800
I'm just an assistant detective.

45
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,440
It says DS here.

46
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,920
Well, I can't help you there.

47
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,960
You're not even related.

48
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,520
Please sign here.

49
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,480
One more thing, Weintraub.
This is Mr Ulrich from police records.

50
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,080
What does the joker want?

51
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,800
Dactyloscopy.

52
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,520
-Fingerprints.
-Just a formality.

53
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,920
-For the discharge?
-For our files. Prophylactical.

54
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,400
Precautionary.

55
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,480
Please.

56
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,480
Well then, show me how you do it.

57
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,120
Thumb.

58
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,840
This is part of it.

59
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,760
GATE 2

60
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,520
Look at that, Stick-it-in Fuchs.

61
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,760
Welcome.

62
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,560
Well, well, well.

63
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,960
Clothes become people, huh?

64
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,560
Senor Walter.

65
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,560
Cigarette?

66
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,840
Here you are.

67
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,800
Vera?

68
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,320
Mr. Weintraub.

69
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,800
Caught red-handed.

70
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,960
You know what? You go ahead.

71
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,440
-I'll go for a little spin with madam.
-They're all waiting.

72
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,720
All the more suspense.

73
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,280
Come closer.

74
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,920
Don't you worry.

75
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,280
I won't hurt you. Come on.

FILM STUDIOS NEUBABELSBERG
POTSDAM-NOWAWES

77
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,000
We'll repeat the stage part
of "We've long lost each other",

78
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,640
the third and fourth shot.
Let's get to work.

79
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,400
-Quiet, please.
-We're rolling.

80
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,400
-Sound.
-Sound is running.

81
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,720
-Roll it.
-89-15, take two.

82
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,760
And action.

83
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,320
I don't see where you are going

84
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,120
When there is silence, and loneliness

85
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,000
Is heavy on my mind, and there is

86
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,920
A wind of grief and sorrow blowing

87
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,840
You don't want to tell me where

88
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,520
Your travels lead your contrary self

89
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,800
Then I must painfully but with purpose

90
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,800
Ask the question you are posing

91
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,240
It was looming inside of me
for a long time

92
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,760
It was pressing inside of me
for a long time

93
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,040
The longing that I once had

94
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,600
Indignation has displaced it now

95
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,920
We have long lost each other

96
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,480
We've grown apart in our hearts

97
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,880
We are the tail of yesterday's magic

98
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:33,400
And in our souls pain alone is burning

99
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,040
Yesterday is melting

100
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,760
Tomorrow is stony

101
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:43,640
Hope is making way to doom

102
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:49,160
There's no world where we are still safe

103
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,600
And lonely I go who knows where

104
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,160
So much happiness was allotted to us

105
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,120
But now it's extinct in our souls

106
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,560
The long wait is followed by giving way

107
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,120
It's cold in my heart
I make no secret of it

108
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,440
We have long lost each other

109
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,760
We've grown apart in our hearts

110
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,880
We are the tail of yesterday's magic

111
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:40,120
And in our souls pain alone is burning

112
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,880
Betty?

113
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,400
Oh God.

114
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,560
What are you doing?

115
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,560
I'm sorry, my little flower.

116
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,000
First,
you have to do what you have to do.

117
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,160
And then...

118
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,400
...you can do what you want to do.

119
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,680
-Yes?
-This is Bellman.

120
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,360
There's been an accident at the studio.

121
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,560
-What kind of accident?
-I, I, I...

122
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,120
Stop the stammering, Bellman, talk.

123
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,760
Betty Winter is dead.

124
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,680
I'm coming.

125
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,880
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

126
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Hello.

127
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,160
Hi.

128
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,320
You'll have to hurry if you want
to read all these before your exam.

129
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,840
No, I'm just returning them
to the library.

130
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,320
May I?

131
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,200
-What's the exam?
-Forensics.

132
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,440
With Ulrich from the records department
and Gennat.

133
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,320
30 minutes with practical part, crime
scene analysis and securing of evidence.

134
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,240
Not exactly my strengths, I fear.

135
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,040
You can do this.

136
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,600
-You think?
-Why yes, of course.

137
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,200
Did you go to prison this morning?

138
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,640
Yup. Greta doesn't want to see me.

139
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,720
She expressedly put that on record.

140
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,560
-The judgement is still out.
-I have to go.

141
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,160
Break a leg!

142
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,280
I didn't mean it like that.

143
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,680
Hi, boss.

144
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,400
-What's up?
-Stay there, we have to go downstairs.

145
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,160
-Where to?
-Babelsberg film studios.

146
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,520
Buddha's order,
we're to go there immediately.

147
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,440
Betty Winter.

148
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,520
One of the greatest, what am I saying,
the greatest hope

149
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,120
we have on stage and in film.

150
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,360
-Had.
-Pardon?

151
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,960
Well, now she's...

152
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,160
This is a huge tragedy.

153
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,120
And I only just met her.

154
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,960
-You mean personally?
-Less than a fortnight ago.

155
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,560
An autograph session in Babelsberg,

156
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,040
on Betty's birthday.

157
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,560
Studio shoot for her last film.

158
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,720
Demon of Passion.

159
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,040
-Doesn't that already exist?
-Only on stage.

160
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,120
But now a brandnew musical film,
with sound.

161
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,440
So you hear them talk, at the cinema?

162
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,200
Yes, and not just talk. They also sing.

163
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,960
Incredible woman.

164
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,800
No wonder the Americans
wanted to lure her there.

165
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,600
Who was that again?

166
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,200
Her husband, Tristan Rot.

167
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,120
He plays the male lead in the film.

168
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,440
Her husband? I thought he was queer.

169
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,240
Yes, he is, but he loved her.

170
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,200
Very much.

171
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,920
What's going on here?

172
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,240
Once again, the press was faster than us.

173
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,320
Detective, what's going on here?

174
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,520
Do you know more
about the Betty Winter case?

175
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,680
CID, make way.

176
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,920
-No recordings.
-Article 118 of the Reich law:

177
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,960
-Every citizen has the right...
-But not now and not here.

178
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,320
-There is no censorship.
-That's enough.

179
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,960
Reinhold,
can't you do something? Please.

180
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,120
Close the gates.

181
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,680
Don't touch anything.

182
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,400
-Homicide division, hello.
-Homicide?

183
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,880
But it was an accident.

184
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,960
-Who are you?
-Jo Bellman, I'm the producer.

185
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,960
It was obviously an accident.

186
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,440
I mean, we all saw it...

187
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,040
We're here to clarify this.

188
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,560
You stay with me.
Everyone else please wait off the set.

189
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,040
So, what exactly happened?

190
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,640
Case study no. 16. A lifeless body,

191
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,160
found in the early morning
by the family gardener

192
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,800
in the property's garage,
identified by the wife,

193
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,880
who called the police immediately.

194
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,160
All external circumstances
point towards suicide.

195
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,400
Miss...

196
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,720
-Ritter. Charlotte Ritter.
-Please, Miss Ritter. Ladies first.

197
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,800
What?

198
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,520
Explain the five steps of the procedure
to determine death,

199
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,920
Gennat method.

200
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,960
One, I get a first general overview
of the crime scene.

201
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,280
-Here?
-Exactly here.

202
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,000
Please don't touch.

203
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,080
Two, staff will look for evidence
and clues.

204
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,440
-How could this have happened?
-The lamp toppled

205
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,280
and the screw heads were torn out.

206
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,240
Where's the cable for the spotlight?

207
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,080
-It's here.
-Don't touch!

208
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,720
It's quite the weight, 10kW.

209
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,520
Boss, shall we start?

210
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,200
-Search the set for clues. Gennat method.
-Yes, sir.

211
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,800
Gloves!

212
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,320
Very good, the gloves.

213
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,640
Each detail is tagged.

214
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,840
The spotlight
was fixed with these screws.

215
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,240
Completely intact.

216
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,600
Three, take pictures of the crime scene.

217
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,280
Four, witnesses are questioned.

218
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,440
My husband was with me all night.

219
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,000
One moment, Mrs Klopsch.
First the question, then the answer.

220
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,280
-Sorry.
-What's your name?

221
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,000
Tilly Brooks.

222
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,680
I see. Where are you from?

223
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,480
-Boston.
-Boston?

224
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,200
Can you tell me in more detail?

225
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,800
I didn't see anything,
I was looking the other way.

226
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,440
-What about the husband, Tristan Rot?
-Tristan?

227
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,880
I didn't see anything,
I was up on the rope.

228
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,200
-Rot wasn't here today.
-It was his day off, as far as I know.

229
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,120
Who's responsible for the lighting?

230
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,800
Peter Glaser, the gaffer.

231
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,880
Where is he?

232
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,040
He only oversaw the set up. Then they
changed shift and he left with the others.

233
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,120
Do you have his data on file?

234
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,920
-Of course.
-Where do you suspect fingerprints?

235
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,640
-Up there, on the balustrade.
-Correct. Take your time.

236
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,680
On the door handle,
on the steering wheel...

237
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,040
Keep going.

238
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,120
-And on the hose on the exhaust pipe.
-Very good.

239
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,920
Detective, the incident was filmed
by this camera.

240
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,720
We need to have it developed
immediately.

241
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,680
I ventured to have that arranged.

242
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,920
Here you are.

243
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,520
Peter Glaser's personal file.

244
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,760
Very well. That's it from us now.

245
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,880
Mr Bellman.

246
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,920
The fifth and last step,

247
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,400
evacuation of the body and evaluation
of the results at headquarters.

248
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,360
Very good, Miss Ritter. Thank you. Next.

249
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,520
Detective!

250
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,880
We need you to sign
that it was an accident. Here.

251
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,960
You'll get it
once we've evaluated everything.

252
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,840
And if it was an accident.

253
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,600
In the lab,
the dactyloscopic examination showed

254
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,600
that the deceased's fingerprints
are not congruent with those

255
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,120
found on the hose on the exhaust pipe.

256
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,040
A comparison with the wife's fingerprints,

257
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,400
seen on the right here,

258
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,600
confirm the assumption
that this was no suicide,

259
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,720
this was an insidious murder
by the wife.

260
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,480
Thank you.

261
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,680
And the motive?

262
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,160
-Revenge.
-Really?

263
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,280
Yes.
The husband had poisoned her lapdog.

264
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,760
-Miss Doris, please write...
-Hang on, not so fast.

265
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,240
Please switch it off again.

266
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,360
Miss Ritter, please explain in more detail
the differences of the fingerprints.

267
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,320
Yes, the...

268
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,480
The grooves are different.

269
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,960
The grooves?

270
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,680
Well, the dorm...

271
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,280
The dormal papillae.

272
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,240
-You mean the dermal papillae.
-Yes, I'm sorry.

273
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,360
The dermal papillae
are different in all people.

274
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,400
Yes, well, every child knows that.

275
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,480
But how do the images
of the dermal papillae differ?

276
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,720
The basic form.

277
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,720
By their basic form. There are
three basic forms and the minutes.

278
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,680
Minutes is what the clock has.

279
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,880
They are called minutiae, deduced from?

280
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,720
Latin for?

281
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,880
Minutiae.

282
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,320
Latin for detail.

283
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,200
Alright. But maybe
you can give us the basic forms.

284
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,640
Well, there are whorls,

285
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,040
and...

286
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,720
And?

287
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,480
Whorls and...

288
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,720
Esther?

289
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,360
Walter is here.

290
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,120
About time.

291
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,480
Looks like
you've been expecting someone.

292
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,920
Welcome back.

293
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,240
Oh, my favourite pests.

294
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,560
What do I see there?

295
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,920
Well, look at that.

296
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,920
Where do these come from?

297
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,520
Thank you.

298
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,400
Edgar.

299
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,880
Welcome home.

300
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,920
I need to show you something.

301
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,040
-What, right now?
-Yes.

302
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,880
We'll go to Moka Efti.

303
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,600
Won't take long.

304
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,800
No, wait.

305
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,640
I'll take that myself.

306
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,560
See you later, guys.

307
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,160
STOCK EXCHANGE
BERLIN-MITTE

308
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,760
Every single sector is joining in.

309
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,920
Each segment we banked on did well.

310
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,240
Some of them in two-digit percentages.

311
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,560
Mrs Nyssen, the ralley is going up.
The Dow Jones is at a historic high.

312
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,120
Prosperity for everyone.

313
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,960
The history of world finance
is re-written.

314
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,040
A few months ago,
no-one would have believed

315
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:36,480
that every American chimney sweep,
each German employee could have stock.

316
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,880
Our fund is banking on growth.

317
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,280
Particularly for large-scale investors
like you.

318
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,320
Mr Ahrensen, the trust is interested
in the new offer of your consortium.

319
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,800
This is encouraging.

320
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,640
What sum?

321
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,880
BUSINESS STATISTICS

322
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,080
45 million American dollars.

323
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,960
The economy is growing.

324
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,160
It's going uphill all the time.

325
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,760
Prosperity for everyone.

326
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,440
Do you believe that?

327
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,280
I beg your pardon?

328
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,200
You see, Wegener, I am someone
who is seeing a mad-doctor.

329
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,920
He says he's a "psychotherapist".

330
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,600
But I say he's a mad-doctor.

331
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,560
I see him
because I was peculiar as a child.

332
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,920
Never played with the others.

333
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,280
I would have liked to but...

334
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,640
I didn't really know how.

335
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,600
Anyway...

336
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,720
He says I'm manic, my mad-doctor.

337
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,680
That's when you want to do and achieve
a lot very fast at the same time.

338
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,880
Off the cuff,
without practice or skills.

339
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,320
You could say megalomaniac.

340
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,840
And he says I'm depressed.

341
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,880
That's when you don't want to do
or achieve anything at all.

342
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,400
Except maybe die or... just lie in bed.

343
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:08,840
And those two phases, the manic and
the depressive, they alternate with me.

344
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:12,920
My mad-doctor is supposed
to anticipate the changes and...

345
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,920
...to adjust my medication accordingly.

346
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,120
Right now, for instance, Wegener,

347
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,840
a manic phase is coming.

348
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,680
And do you know

349
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,400
how to recognise a manic phase?

350
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,120
You suddenly grasp
all the interdependencies.

351
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:35,640
What we see right now
is a mania at the stock market.

352
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,680
Something is inflated here.

353
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,880
Wegener, that Ahrensen guy
and his Jewish business finance,

354
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:49,960
they are nothing but a state-subsidised,
international criminal gang.

355
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,800
We'll put a stop to their game.

356
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,520
And we'll get our money back
and our country.

357
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,280
With their means.

358
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,920
We need to get a hold of the client lists
of the large banks.

359
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:11,120
I want to know if the small investors
really all fall for this scam and...

360
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,960
And how much they actually know
about this.

361
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,360
I'm sure it's possible
to procure those client lists.

362
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,600
But illegal.

363
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,880
Yes, we're turning criminal now,
Wegener.

364
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,960
The mail!

365
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,800
-Hello.
-Hello.

366
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,800
Curtains.

367
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,280
It's heavy.

368
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,960
Here, let me help you.

369
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,840
Thank you.

370
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,920
You're welcome.

371
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,640
-Ok. Bye.
-Bye.

372
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:36,200
First he acts all friendly
and gives me a "you'll be fine" look,

373
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,840
and then he fails me.

374
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,160
-Because of the minutes?
-Minutiae.

375
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,360
-Can't you take the exam again?
-In a year.

376
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,760
What do I do without
investigatory powers for one year?

377
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,120
Now I'm not allowed
first access at crime scenes.

378
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,880
And Doris told me all male candidates
passed and they were a lot worse.

379
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,040
-So you need to be better.
-I am better!

380
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,240
They simply don't want any women
in the department.

381
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,320
I do.

382
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,480
Charlotte, stop it.

383
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,600
You're still an assistant detective.

384
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,200
Even without the crime scene permit.

385
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,120
And I need your alert mind now.

386
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,640
Are you coming?

387
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,760
Where to?

388
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,800
We're going to the pictures.

389
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,160
You have to learn to distinguish between
relevant and irrelevant questions.

390
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,440
Is it irrelevant
if you know what minutiae are?

391
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,560
The young woman established
the circumstances of the crime perfectly.

392
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,600
And then you threw her off track.

393
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,840
I asked for simple technical knowledge.

394
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,120
It's your credo, Criminal Counsellor.

395
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,800
The biggest secrets are hidden
in the smallest of details.

396
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,240
Precision is important in our work.

397
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,600
But pettiness is harmful.

398
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,760
This is where we disagree, Mr Ulrich.

399
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,800
Mr Gräf.

400
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,480
Go ahead.

401
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,720
Appalling.

402
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,800
Can we see the last part again?

403
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,720
I can only show you all of it.

404
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,800
But we have a cutting table.

405
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,880
Ok.

406
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,160
Well, I never.

407
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,040
How did this happen?

408
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,920
Someone tampered with the water pipe.

409
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,800
It was a proper explosion.

410
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,200
-So it wasn't an accident?
-No.

411
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,440
Who would have done that?

412
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,400
I don't know yet.

413
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,120
There's more bad news.

414
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,920
Betty Winter.

415
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,000
No accident, either.

416
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,400
What makes you say that?

417
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,320
I tidied the place
before the cops arrived.

418
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,120
The spotlight had been tampered with.

419
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,720
-Who knows about this?
-No-one...

420
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,120
...saw anything.

421
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,720
-No-one.
-Is that clear?

422
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,920
Sawed through?

423
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:59,640
Walter, there was something fishy
about the production from the start.

424
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,320
Right away, a fire in props storage.

425
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,440
One week later,
a crane falls onto the set.

426
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,560
The next day,
someone steals the camera off the truck,

427
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,640
and then...

428
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,600
...two weeks later,

429
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,640
there's a murder.

430
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,320
Who is behind that? What do you think?

431
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,480
Walter, we invested a lot of money,
you hear? A shitload.

432
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,160
How much of ours is in there?

433
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,120
One million.

434
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,800
And a second million from the bank.

435
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,680
Screw me.

436
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,400
If the cops find out that it wasn't
an accident, we'll be left with the costs.

437
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,600
I think we'll have to visit some people
in the near future.

438
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,320
Stop. There.

439
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,600
Her.

440
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,000
What is she doing?

441
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,000
What is she looking at?

442
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,160
-Do we know who it is?
-Tilly Brooks.

443
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,920
That name doesn't ring a bell.

444
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,040
The lady's name is Mathilde Spielmann.

445
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,280
Tilly Brooks must be an alias.

446
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,120
-Do you have her address?
-Yes.

447
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,480
I'd like to question her.

448
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,160
-I'll visit her.
-Or I.

449
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,840
Or both of you?

450
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,800
Yes, boss.

451
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,560
Oh, I'll take that now.
I'm going to the lab now, Mrs... Rath.

452
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,920
-Do I have to do anything else?
-The nurse wrote down your appointment?

453
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,760
Yes.

454
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,880
That's it? No examination?

455
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,200
No. We'll inject a mouse
with your sample.

456
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,760
If there is chorionic gonadotropin
in your urine,

457
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:40,400
the animal's ovaries will react
with ovulation within the next 72 hours.

458
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,760
Come back later this week
for an appointment with Dr. Zondek.

459
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,840
Ok.

460
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,920
Next, please.

461
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,640
Finished your work, miss?

462
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,720
Where's Toni?

463
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,160
Toilet.

464
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,640
And, has he been in already?

465
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,840
-Who?
-The day sleeper.

466
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,800
Oh, him. Yes, just now.

467
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,080
Just now?

468
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,120
He's supposed to be out by seven.

469
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,320
He's got the day, we have the night.
It's in the lease.

470
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,200
It's nearly eight now.

471
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,160
You can discuss it with the man himself.

472
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,920
But I don't know him.

473
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,160
What? Still haven't seen
your fellow tenant?

474
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,880
Not so far, no.

475
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,960
Give it to me, moron.

476
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,480
There you are.

477
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Come on.

478
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,240
Oh, he's left a mess again, that idiot.

479
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,040
Typical.

480
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,200
Just drops everything.

481
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,320
Alright.

482
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,560
He should read it, that swine.
House rules.

483
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,320
At least he has a gramophone.

484
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,960
Right, now we'll put everything
in his bed linen.

485
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,720
Through all of history

486
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,440
A breeze of emancipation is blowing

487
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,720
From human beings to infusoria

488
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,040
Woman wants to be on the throne
everywhere

489
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,560
From the Amazons to the girls of Berlin...

490
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,400
Look at this. Disgusting thing.

491
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,720
Throw it away!

492
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,760
What men can do

493
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,800
We've been doing for a long time

494
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,080
And maybe a whole lot more

495
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,640
Out with the men in the Reichstag

496
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,800
And out with the men in the Landtag

497
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,440
And out with the men in the manor house

498
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,960
We'll turn it into a woman's house

499
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,960
Out with the men in existence

500
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,600
And out with the men who are still here

501
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,520
And out with the men who are over there

502
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,240
They should already have gone

503
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,680
Yeah, out with the men in the den

504
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,880
And into those places with the women

505
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,840
Well, there you go.

506
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,920
Truth is a treacherous beast.

507
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,920
Our alliance with the past is diffused
by our desire to form versions

508
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,680
and variations of our experiences.

509
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:01,000
But there are no versions of the truth.

510
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,160
The truth is singular.

511
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,080
There is a subject across from me today,
let's call him Siegfried.

512
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,360
The challenge is to demonstrate with him

513
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:18,880
how much man tends to get tangled up
in lies and self-deception,

514
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,560
solely because of his desire
to have everything he experiences

515
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,920
and which seems incomprehensible
make sense.

516
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,640
Siegfried, are you ready?

517
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,320
Yes.

518
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,200
Focus. Don't waste any time
for your answers.

519
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:38,120
The more time an answer has
to follow a question,

520
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,280
the less room there is for the truth.

521
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:46,280
So answer my questions
immediately now.

522
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,360
Yes.

523
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
-Do you love the ocean?
-Yes.

524
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,840
-Do you love mountains?
-No.

525
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,880
-Do you love cigarettes?
-Yes.

526
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,560
-Have you ever killed a human being?
-Yes.

527
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,400
-When did you kill them?
-In the war.

528
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,040
And in civil life?

529
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,600
-Yes.
-Do you love your father?

530
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,680
Yes.

531
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,920
Do you love your father?

532
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,360
Yes.

533
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,280
-Why are you crying?
-I don't know.

534
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
-You distract. Why are you crying?
-I don't know.

535
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,360
Your tears are distracting.
Why are you crying?

536
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,440
Because...

537
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,320
-...it hurts.
-Correct.

538
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,200
-You feel the pain because you lied?
-Yes.

539
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,560
-You redirected it into tears?
-Yes.

540
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,440
Speaking the truth will conquer your pain.

541
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,520
Yes.

542
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,120
Do you love your father?

543
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,200
I hate him.

544
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,440
-Do you desire other women?
-Yes.

545
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,080
-Do you desire the woman you live with?
-Yes.

546
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,000
-No.
-If not, why not?

547
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,640
-I don't know.
-If not, why not?

548
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,760
-I don't know. I don't know!
-If not, then why not?

549
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,960
-Because I am lying to her.
-Why do you have to lie to her?

550
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,760
Because he's demanding me to.

551
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,640
-Who is he?
-My brother.

552
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,320
Where is your brother?

553
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,280
Where is your brother?

554
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,800
My brother is dead.

555
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,080
-Is that the truth?
-Yes.

556
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,440
What is demanded of you?

557
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,560
To tell the truth.

558
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,360
Why do you lie
to the woman you live with?

559
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,280
-I don't lie to her.
-That's right.

560
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,160
-Where is your brother?
-He is dead.

561
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,280
-Do you lie to the woman you live with?
-No.

562
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,640
You see?

563
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,400
But...

564
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,360
...I'm losing her.

565
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:32,920
-You're not losing her.
-Yes, I am.

566
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,840
-You're not losing her.
-She's leaving, I'm losing her.

567
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,520
You can't lose her.

568
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,440
Why?

569
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,400
Because she's not yours.

570
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:48,240
-Repeat this.
-She's not mine.

571
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,560
You can't lose anything
because you don't own anything.

572
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,200
I own nothing.

573
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,520
You're not afraid
because you can't lose anything. Say it.

574
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:00,320
I'm not afraid...
because I don't own anything.

575
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,120
You have embarked on a journey,

576
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,080
Siegfried, on a journey to the light.

577
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,480
Do you understand what I'm saying?

578
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,160
Yes.

579
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,320
Do you want to guide us,
from the darkness to the light?

580
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,160
Yes.

581
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,560
Do you want to guide us
from the darkness to the light?

582
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,280
Yes.

583
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,760
The truth to the light?

584
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,760
-To the truth, to the light.
-To the truth,

585
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,320
to the light.

586
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,800
To the truth, to the light.

587
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,240
To the truth, to the light.

588
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,200
To the truth, to the light...

1
00:00:14,884 --> 00:00:16,538
Eddie!

2
00:00:16,581 --> 00:00:18,931
Eddie! Stop! Stop right there.

3
00:00:18,975 --> 00:00:20,150
Eddie, no! No!

4
00:00:21,543 --> 00:00:23,501
Hey no, no! Eddie! Eddie!

5
00:00:23,545 --> 00:00:25,068
Ed Eddie! Eddie!

6
00:00:29,594 --> 00:00:30,682
Eddie.

7
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:35,383
I got you. I got you, buddy.

8
00:00:35,426 --> 00:00:38,081
I'm right here. I'm right here.

9
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,736
What the hell
got into you, buddy?

10
00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:44,974
I have a question.

11
00:01:45,017 --> 00:01:47,716
Why would a guy
come to a bar

12
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,674
and order a club soda?

13
00:01:50,936 --> 00:01:52,895
I don't know.
Uh, it's 10:00 a.m.?

14
00:01:52,938 --> 00:01:54,331
That doesn't stop people
at airports.

15
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:56,246
Oh, so you've been watching me?

16
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,161
No.

17
00:01:58,205 --> 00:02:00,250
You are sitting
underneath the TV,

18
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:02,122
and I've been
watching that.Ah.

19
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:03,514
But it did
have me wonder,

20
00:02:03,558 --> 00:02:05,734
because there are
a lot of places a guy could go

21
00:02:05,777 --> 00:02:08,519
to get a glass
of carbonated water...Mm.

22
00:02:08,563 --> 00:02:11,131
...but you came to a bar,
and so you want to be drinking,

23
00:02:11,174 --> 00:02:12,871
but instead you're staring
at a cup of club soda.

24
00:02:12,915 --> 00:02:14,960
Are you, are you
the beverage police?

25
00:02:15,004 --> 00:02:16,310
Yes, I am.

26
00:02:17,485 --> 00:02:18,442
And I'm writing you up.

27
00:02:20,923 --> 00:02:22,490
You, uh...

28
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:24,883
I-I do, I do, uh, drink alcohol,

29
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:26,450
too, sometimes.

30
00:02:26,494 --> 00:02:28,452
Would you like to sit?

31
00:02:28,496 --> 00:02:30,280
Yeah. Okay.Yeah?

32
00:02:30,324 --> 00:02:31,890
Please.If you insist.

33
00:02:31,934 --> 00:02:34,632
Are we gonna drink alcohol?

34
00:02:34,676 --> 00:02:36,634
I mean, it's not the airport,

35
00:02:36,678 --> 00:02:39,159
but I'll give it a shot
if you want, yeah.All right.

36
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:40,421
Hi.
Hi.

37
00:02:40,464 --> 00:02:41,509
What can I get for you?

38
00:02:41,552 --> 00:02:42,466
Hi. He's gonna
have an Irish Mule,

39
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,207
and I...Wha

40
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:45,556
Hold on. Uh,
what's a...

41
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,079
what's an Irish Mule?Oh, no.

42
00:02:47,123 --> 00:02:48,342
You'll like it. It's good.

43
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:50,082
Maybe I want a Scotch.

44
00:02:50,126 --> 00:02:51,475
Maybe this isn't about
what you want and maybe

45
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,694
this is about what you need.

46
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:55,349
I'd listen to the lady.

47
00:02:55,392 --> 00:02:56,654
Sounds like she knows
what she's talking about.

48
00:02:56,698 --> 00:02:58,961
Yeah, she does, but, um,
I-I don't even know

49
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:01,224
what is in an Irish Mule.

50
00:03:01,268 --> 00:03:02,921
He's always like this.

51
00:03:02,965 --> 00:03:04,488
I'm sure he's always
like this.

52
00:03:04,532 --> 00:03:05,837
The ginger
in the ginger beer

53
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:07,796
is gonna help improve
your brain function.

54
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:10,015
Which will maybe bring you back
to the land of the living.

55
00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:12,017
And the whiskey, well,
that is nothing less

56
00:03:12,061 --> 00:03:14,019
than a time-honored tradition
to elevate one's mood.

57
00:03:14,063 --> 00:03:15,934
Aha.
Mm-hmm.

58
00:03:15,978 --> 00:03:17,762
Two Irish Mules, then.Actually, that's
too sweet for me.

59
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:18,894
I'm gonna have a Scotch.

60
00:03:18,937 --> 00:03:20,374
Neat.
You got it.

61
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:22,202
You're very funny.

62
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:24,291
Mm-hmm. What's your name?

63
00:03:24,334 --> 00:03:25,944
Oh, God, that's so clichÃ©.

64
00:03:25,988 --> 00:03:27,250
Really, you're gonna meet
someone at a bar,

65
00:03:27,294 --> 00:03:28,425
and that's your opening line?

66
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:30,688
I just, I feel like
you're the type of guy

67
00:03:30,732 --> 00:03:31,907
who comes up with something
more original.

68
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,257
I-I generally would be
that type of guy.

69
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:36,128
Maybe I get a drink in me first
and that'll help.

70
00:03:36,172 --> 00:03:38,914
Hmm. I'll allow it.

71
00:03:38,957 --> 00:03:40,437
You will. Nice.Yes.

72
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:42,134
Nice. This will be
a two-way street.

73
00:03:42,178 --> 00:03:44,224
I will not ask you your name,
I will not ask you what you do.

74
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:45,747
And...

75
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,575
we will think
of only interesting

76
00:03:47,618 --> 00:03:49,490
and original things
to talk about.Okay.

77
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:51,970
We will do that, um...

78
00:03:52,014 --> 00:03:53,885
Right after you take that.

79
00:03:53,929 --> 00:03:56,497
It's-it's a work thing. I-I
promise I'll be right back.

80
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,802
Mm.If you touch my Irish Mule,

81
00:03:57,846 --> 00:03:59,978
I'll, um, I'll do
something terrible. Okay?

82
00:04:00,022 --> 00:04:01,980
Give me one second.

83
00:04:02,024 --> 00:04:05,157
Hey. Um, I'm
just, quick question

84
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:07,725
um, how am I supposed to have
a couple personal days

85
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:09,074
if you keep calling me
all the time?

86
00:04:09,118 --> 00:04:10,554
Relax.

87
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:12,382
It's not a work thing.
I'm just checking in with you.

88
00:04:12,426 --> 00:04:14,079
I'm-I'm doing fine.
But, hey, I-I did,

89
00:04:14,123 --> 00:04:16,386
I called Adam again, a-and it
went straight to voice mail.

90
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,996
All right, so I'm thinking,Mm-hmm.

91
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,260
usually it rings a couple times,
then it goes to voice mail.

92
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:23,263
So, when-when in life
do you turn your phone off?

93
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:25,395
I don't know. Uh, when I'm on
a plane, I guess.

94
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:28,180
That's right. Right,
so maybe he's on his way back

95
00:04:28,224 --> 00:04:29,312
from wherever he was.

96
00:04:29,356 --> 00:04:31,271
Yeah, it's possible.

97
00:04:31,314 --> 00:04:32,837
Hang on. You're
okay, you're okay.

98
00:04:32,881 --> 00:04:34,709
It's all right.
It's all right.

99
00:04:34,752 --> 00:04:36,319
How's Eddie doing?

100
00:04:36,363 --> 00:04:37,625
Uh, he seemed
a little off when I left.

101
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:39,583
No, he's worse than "off."

102
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:41,846
He took off from the house, ran
into traffic on Kalanianaole.

103
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,065
I just pulled him out.

104
00:04:43,108 --> 00:04:45,110
You need a hand?No, no, no, I'm good.

105
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:46,895
I got the vet
coming by pretty soon.

106
00:04:46,938 --> 00:04:48,331
Is that the vet,
the nice vet lady

107
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,464
that you took out on a date
and it went really great

108
00:04:50,507 --> 00:04:52,117
and you didn't ask her out again
because you're insane

109
00:04:52,161 --> 00:04:53,293
or something?

110
00:04:53,336 --> 00:04:55,295
Yes, her. Listen, uh...

111
00:04:55,338 --> 00:04:56,731
after I'm done here,
I'm gonna go

112
00:04:56,774 --> 00:04:58,776
grab a bite to eat.
You want to join me?

113
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,778
Uh, no, I don't want
to have a bite with you.

114
00:05:00,822 --> 00:05:02,258
In fact, I am sitting
at a bar right now

115
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,304
with a very pretty lady.

116
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:06,567
What are you doing talking
to me? Are you crazy?

117
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,091
Listen to me, Danny, don't blow
this very rare opportunity

118
00:05:09,134 --> 00:05:10,658
that a w a female wants

119
00:05:10,701 --> 00:05:11,876
to converse with you.

120
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,356
Get this
she actually came up to me.

121
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,358
Oh, wait, is she a bartender?

122
00:05:15,402 --> 00:05:17,186
'Cause you know that
she has to talk to you.

123
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:18,361
If that's the case,
that's her job.

124
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:20,798
Tell Eddie I love him.
Okay? Goodbye.

125
00:05:20,842 --> 00:05:22,887
Very sorry. Sorry, sorry.

126
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:24,411
It's fine.
Is everything okay?

127
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:25,673
Yeah, everything's good.
Okay.

128
00:05:25,716 --> 00:05:28,066
Ah. Ahoy.

129
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,894
All right. Down the hatch.All right.

130
00:05:29,938 --> 00:05:31,679
Cheers.
Yep.

131
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:34,682
Mmm.

132
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:36,074
That's a lot.

133
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:37,467
It's, uh, it's good.

134
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:41,166
So, how-how are you liking
the island so far?

135
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,907
So far?

136
00:05:42,951 --> 00:05:44,082
Mm-hmm.

137
00:05:44,126 --> 00:05:45,083
What makes you think
I'm new here?

138
00:05:45,127 --> 00:05:46,520
Oh, well, the outfit, for one.

139
00:05:46,563 --> 00:05:49,305
Which I like very much.

140
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,828
It's very classy.
You look fantastic.

141
00:05:50,872 --> 00:05:52,526
But it's very
East Coast.

142
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:55,746
And you look like, uh, you know,
you'd be gainfully employed,

143
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,922
but, uh, we're at a bar,
not an office.

144
00:05:57,966 --> 00:05:59,924
Thank you.So here-here's
what I'm thinking.

145
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:02,231
I'm thinking either you, um,
you got a new gig,

146
00:06:02,274 --> 00:06:03,406
flew out here for it,

147
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,452
it hasn't started yet,
or you-you know,

148
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:07,497
you're doing, like, half-days

149
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:10,326
while you, while y-you get
yourself settled.

150
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,110
How am I doing?
Warm? Hot? Cold?

151
00:06:12,154 --> 00:06:13,634
Yeah, I think
you're pretty warm.

152
00:06:13,677 --> 00:06:14,852
Thanks.

153
00:06:14,896 --> 00:06:16,071
So are you, like...

154
00:06:16,114 --> 00:06:17,638
you're, like,
a detective or something?

155
00:06:17,681 --> 00:06:20,858
Something like that.

156
00:06:21,903 --> 00:06:24,035
Can I tell you things?
Can I be honest?

157
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,386
Please.I'm not,

158
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:29,301
I'm not too sure
about this place.

159
00:06:29,345 --> 00:06:30,390
Not

160
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:31,956
The, um, the island.

161
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,524
Ah. I understand.

162
00:06:34,568 --> 00:06:37,484
And, uh, I felt the same way
when I first got here,

163
00:06:37,527 --> 00:06:39,703
but it grows on you.

164
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:42,227
Right. I'll believe that.

165
00:06:42,271 --> 00:06:43,403
Mm-hmm.

166
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,379
That was, uh...

167
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,381
Yeah, it was.

168
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,427
For the record not that, uh,

169
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,558
you're keeping a
record or anything...

170
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:10,430
...but, uh, I've
never done

171
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:12,040
this before.

172
00:07:14,825 --> 00:07:16,131
Yeah. Me, neither.

173
00:07:16,174 --> 00:07:17,698
Oh, that's good.

174
00:07:18,742 --> 00:07:20,396
Um...

175
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,006
I don't know, if you're up
for it sometime, maybe

176
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,530
I'd like to take you out to
dinner or something like that?

177
00:07:23,573 --> 00:07:25,575
Take me out to dinner?Yeah, something
like that.

178
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:28,709
Yes, I would, um,
I would like that very much.

179
00:07:28,752 --> 00:07:29,971

Good.

180
00:07:30,014 --> 00:07:31,581
Good.

181
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,975
Just, um...

182
00:07:34,018 --> 00:07:35,150
What-what are
you doing?

183
00:07:35,193 --> 00:07:36,586
I'm calling a Lyft.

184
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,892
Oh, why you calling a Lyft?

185
00:07:37,935 --> 00:07:39,328
I think, I think I could
give you a ride home.

186
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:41,678
Oh, you could give me a ride?Mm-hmm.

187
00:07:42,723 --> 00:07:43,898
You don't, you don't
have to do that.

188
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:45,465
I know, I'd like to do that.

189
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:46,770
Uh, and I had one sip
of that drink.

190
00:07:46,814 --> 00:07:48,468
Yes. I know,
you did not like that.

191
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:49,991
It was okay.

192
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:53,473
I guess I'm gonna get
in a strange man's car.

193
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:55,475
You are gonna get in a strange
man's midsize rental.

194
00:07:55,518 --> 00:07:56,606
Wow.Yeah.

195
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:57,912
A midsize rental.Yeah. But it came

196
00:07:57,955 --> 00:08:00,392
with a beautiful, uh,
tropical air freshener.

197
00:08:00,436 --> 00:08:01,785
Wow. Uh, you know,

198
00:08:01,829 --> 00:08:03,787
on second thought,
I'll probably just take the bus.

199
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:05,485
Shut up.

200
00:08:05,528 --> 00:08:07,095
Whoa, hey.

201
00:08:07,138 --> 00:08:09,140
What?You trying
to get busted?

202
00:08:09,184 --> 00:08:10,490
Let me just make sure
the coast is clear.

203
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:12,100
Frickin' amateur hour over here.

204
00:08:12,143 --> 00:08:13,884

Sorry, sorry.

205
00:08:23,154 --> 00:08:25,113
Hey, I don't, I don't want

206
00:08:25,156 --> 00:08:28,116
to, uh, I don't want to pry,
but, uh, why Haleiwa?

207
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,378
Oh.

208
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:32,294
I don't know.
Uh, my friend lives there...

209
00:08:32,337 --> 00:08:33,948
Oh....with her husband
and these rotten kids.

210
00:08:33,991 --> 00:08:35,253
I'm just staying there

211
00:08:35,297 --> 00:08:39,214
until I can find a room
of my own in Honolulu.

212
00:08:39,257 --> 00:08:40,650
Uh, how's that going for you,
the search?

213
00:08:40,694 --> 00:08:42,913
Oh, it's terrible.
It's the worst. Um...

214
00:08:42,957 --> 00:08:44,654
This place I saw the other week,

215
00:08:44,698 --> 00:08:46,090
it was pretty cool

216
00:08:46,134 --> 00:08:47,396
'cause it's about
a half a block away

217
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:49,485
from where Benny Agbayani went
to high school.

218
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,748
Okay, stop everything right now.

219
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:53,228
Did you just name-drop

220
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:55,926
late-90s Mets outfielder
Benny Agbayani?

221
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,102
Wow.
You got that reference.

222
00:08:58,146 --> 00:08:59,495
Yeah Me? I'm-I'm
the Hawaiian Punch?

223
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,757
I was at the game.

224
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:02,193
No, you were not. You were not.Yes, I was.

225
00:09:02,237 --> 00:09:03,673
Don't No. No.I'm telling you,

226
00:09:03,717 --> 00:09:05,022
it was the craziest thing
I've ever seen live.

227
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:07,198
I'm telling you,
it was, it was, it was nuts.

228
00:09:07,242 --> 00:09:08,504
That's crazy.
Thought it was the third out.

229
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,114
Yeah.Ah, I knew

230
00:09:10,158 --> 00:09:11,638
you were from the East Coast.
You're from the East Coast.

231
00:09:11,681 --> 00:09:14,641
Okay, I think that
you are from... Jersey.

232
00:09:14,684 --> 00:09:16,773
Yes, I am. Yes, I am.

233
00:09:16,817 --> 00:09:17,774
I love Jersey.

234
00:09:17,818 --> 00:09:19,646
That makes two of us.

235
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:20,908
Well, I'm from Massapequa.

236
00:09:20,951 --> 00:09:22,126
All right. Strong Island.

237
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,301
But I love Passaic.

238
00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:25,216
My-my favorite aunt lived there.

239
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,522
Okay.Yeah, it was the best.

240
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,656
I'd go see her
and we'd watch R-rated movies

241
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:31,527
and we'd order sausage pizza
from Romeo's.

242
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:35,313
Romeo's. Well, your aunt
has very good taste.

243
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,844
He sees us, right?

244
00:09:43,887 --> 00:09:45,149
Hey...
Hold on.

245
00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:47,456
Oh, my God!

246
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:16,572
Doc, hey. Thanks so much.

247
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,008
Uh, come in, come in.

248
00:10:18,052 --> 00:10:22,273
Um, I know you don't
usually do house calls.

249
00:10:22,317 --> 00:10:23,927
Yeah, no, I don't,
but it sounded urgent.

250
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:25,320
Where is he?He's in the kitchen.

251
00:10:25,363 --> 00:10:26,930
Small confined space, right?
Like you said.

252
00:10:26,974 --> 00:10:29,454
Yeah, good. Oh,
well, uh whoa.

253
00:10:29,498 --> 00:10:30,586
Probably, it's...

254
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,196
probably best if I conduct

255
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,763
my initial exam without you.

256
00:10:33,807 --> 00:10:36,766
It's just that dogs, they pick
up on our anxiety and...

257
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,159
Yeah, I got a little bit
of that today.Yeah.

258
00:10:38,202 --> 00:10:39,595
Um, just so you know,

259
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,207
uh, what's been going on lately,
has been, uh, bizarre.

260
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:44,774
I mean, he's not himself.How so?

261
00:10:44,818 --> 00:10:46,297
What do you mean?Well, he's kind of s

262
00:10:46,341 --> 00:10:47,647
he's skittish and jumpy,
he's, like,

263
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,300
on high alert all the time.

264
00:10:49,344 --> 00:10:51,781
And you know Eddie.
He's a relaxed guy.

265
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:54,001
Right? I mean,
at the moment, I can't,

266
00:10:54,044 --> 00:10:56,481
I can't close a drawer
in the, in the bedroom

267
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:57,874
without him
totally freaking out.

268
00:10:57,918 --> 00:10:59,615
And this morning, the door
was cracked a little bit.

269
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,138
He bolted.
He's never done that before.

270
00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:03,924
He ended up in the middle
of Kalanianaole.

271
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:06,143
Almost got us both killed
pulling him out of that traffic.

272
00:11:06,187 --> 00:11:08,972
Well, uh, how about I
go take a look at him?

273
00:11:09,016 --> 00:11:11,235
Yeah, yeah; yeah, yeah. Okay.

274
00:11:14,151 --> 00:11:15,718
Hey, there, Eddie.

275
00:11:15,762 --> 00:11:17,981
Remember me?
Stitched you up

276
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:20,984
a little while back?

277
00:11:21,028 --> 00:11:24,248
All right... it's maybe not
the most pleasant of memories.

278
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:26,990
Right? I thought we had a
little bit of a bond, hmm?

279
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:30,124
Now let's see what's going on
with you, bud.

280
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:33,997
Come on. Let's see, bud...

281
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,695
Good boy...

282
00:11:37,174 --> 00:11:41,613
All right. Let's just check
those pearly whites...

283
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:45,748
All right.
Good boy.

284
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:48,359
Good boy.

285
00:11:58,892 --> 00:12:00,850
Uh, hey...

286
00:12:00,894 --> 00:12:03,723
Look at me.
You okay?
Yeah...

287
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:05,855
Look at me.
Uh, it hurts...

288
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:07,291
All right.
It hurts.

289
00:12:07,335 --> 00:12:09,729
Okay.
I'm gonna get my
phone, all right?

290
00:12:14,908 --> 00:12:15,952
Hey.

291
00:12:15,996 --> 00:12:17,562
Mm-hmm?Where's your phone?

292
00:12:17,606 --> 00:12:21,436
Uh, it's in my, um,
it's in my bag.

293
00:12:32,055 --> 00:12:34,666
Oh, God,
my legs...

294
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,799
God, it hurts.

295
00:12:39,715 --> 00:12:41,586
Okay.

296
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,153
All right.

297
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:45,155
We got no service.
I'm gonna...

298
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:46,896
I'm gonna go up
to the road,

299
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,334
try to get a signal, okay?Mm-hmm...

300
00:12:50,378 --> 00:12:52,162
All right?

301
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:53,642
Okay.

302
00:12:53,685 --> 00:12:55,470
We're gonna be fine,
all right? I promise.

303
00:12:55,513 --> 00:12:56,819
Sorry.

304
00:12:56,863 --> 00:13:00,475
Huh?Mm...

305
00:13:00,518 --> 00:13:03,043
Seven-two-four.

306
00:13:03,086 --> 00:13:05,393
Huh?
The, um...
the last three digits...

307
00:13:05,436 --> 00:13:07,874
...of the plate
were seven, two, four.

308
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:10,659
Don't worry about
that right now, okay?You have to tell...

309
00:13:10,702 --> 00:13:12,269
you have
to tell the police,

310
00:13:12,313 --> 00:13:13,836
so that he doesn't
hurt anyone.

311
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,882
He already hurt somebody.

312
00:13:17,187 --> 00:13:18,841
Just...

313
00:13:18,885 --> 00:13:20,887
just breathe.

314
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,279
It's gonna be okay,
I promise, all right?

315
00:13:22,323 --> 00:13:24,455
Be right back.

316
00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:26,414
Seven-two-four, right?
Got it.Seven-two-four.

317
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:37,991
The door's jammed.

318
00:13:56,966 --> 00:14:00,143
Hey.Hey.

319
00:14:00,187 --> 00:14:02,929
He's showing signs of
post-traumatic stress.

320
00:14:02,972 --> 00:14:04,321
PTS?

321
00:14:04,365 --> 00:14:06,628
Okay, h I know
military working dogs

322
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:09,326
can get PTS, but he's never
shown a hint of that.

323
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,763
Maybe so. But what he's
exhibiting right now,

324
00:14:11,807 --> 00:14:12,982
hyper-vigilance,

325
00:14:13,026 --> 00:14:14,766
an elevated heart
rate, dilated pupils;

326
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,377
those are
telltale signs.Doc, this doesn't

327
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,161
make any sense.
Uh, look, after the Marines,

328
00:14:18,205 --> 00:14:20,816
he was with the DEA for years.
Why now?

329
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,690
Look, Steve, you and I both know
PTS is varied; it's complex.

330
00:14:25,734 --> 00:14:27,649
We understand very little
of how it affects humans,

331
00:14:27,692 --> 00:14:28,998
much less dogs.

332
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:30,434
I don't know;
in my opinion,

333
00:14:30,478 --> 00:14:33,220
I think that Eddie must have
some long-buried trauma

334
00:14:33,263 --> 00:14:35,700
that for some reason
has just resurfaced.

335
00:14:35,744 --> 00:14:38,051
But I don't know. I'm not
an expert in this, so...

336
00:14:38,094 --> 00:14:40,923
sorry I... can't
be more helpful.

337
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:42,577
No, no, you've been
plenty helpful, thank you.

338
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,579
I'm, I'm just, you know...

339
00:14:47,538 --> 00:14:49,410
Thank you.

340
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:50,759
I mean...

341
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:55,285
I-I got a place
to start now, right?Yeah.

342
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:56,852
Um, Emma,

343
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,245
before you leave?

344
00:14:58,288 --> 00:15:00,160
I feel like I should probably
bring up the, uh...

345
00:15:00,203 --> 00:15:02,814
How how you never
called me back?

346
00:15:02,858 --> 00:15:04,077
Yes. That.

347
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,252
And, uh...

348
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:07,558
first of all, I'm really sorry.

349
00:15:07,602 --> 00:15:09,169
I just want to let you know
that, uh,

350
00:15:09,212 --> 00:15:10,605
it wasn't because
I didn't like you,

351
00:15:10,648 --> 00:15:13,086
'cause I did, I do.
I mean...

352
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:19,570
I have always had a problem
balancing the job with my life,

353
00:15:19,614 --> 00:15:22,225
and historically,

354
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:25,185
uh, my personal life always
gets the short end of the stick,

355
00:15:25,228 --> 00:15:28,884
and I guess I just wanted
to let you know that, um...

356
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,277
it wasn't a you issue.

357
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,280
Uh... I'm the problem.

358
00:15:35,282 --> 00:15:37,893
Typically, when men say
something like that to me,

359
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:38,981
I think about

360
00:15:39,025 --> 00:15:41,375
which shin I should
kick.

361
00:15:41,418 --> 00:15:43,029
But...

362
00:15:43,072 --> 00:15:46,032
I don't know, for some reason,
when you say it, I believe you.

363
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:48,425
Well, you should,
'cause it's the truth.

364
00:15:48,469 --> 00:15:51,951
Yeah. Hey, look,
there's no hard feelings.

365
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:54,257
'Cause I'm seeing someone.

366
00:15:54,301 --> 00:15:56,085
That's great.Yeah, it turns out
there are some good guys

367
00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:57,739
on those godforsaken apps, so...

368
00:15:57,782 --> 00:15:59,959
I'm legitimately happy for you.
You deserve it.

369
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:01,395
Thanks.

370
00:16:01,438 --> 00:16:03,875
Anyway, I don't want
to hold you hostage.

371
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:05,616
Thank you.
Bye, Steve.

372
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,967
Oh, and keep me
posted on Eddie.

373
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,838
I will, I promise.
Thanks again, Emma.Yeah.

374
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:21,589
Big man on campus.

375
00:16:21,632 --> 00:16:23,286
How's Parents Weekend? Expensive.

376
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,332
Renee's got me
running all over the place

377
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,898
running errands
while she's helping Will

378
00:16:26,942 --> 00:16:29,118
decorate his
new off-campus apartment.

379
00:16:29,162 --> 00:16:31,033
Uh-huh.Boy, these kids now.

380
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:33,035
Did you know, when I went away
to school,

381
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:34,863
you know what my parents
gave me?

382
00:16:34,906 --> 00:16:37,866
A ratty old blanket and a roll
of quarters for the pay phone

383
00:16:37,909 --> 00:16:38,998
and the laundromat.

384
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:42,131
Now, Father of the Year,

385
00:16:42,175 --> 00:16:44,916
aka yours truly,
is going out to buy Will

386
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,486
a flat screen TV and a portable
air conditioning unit.

387
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,836
Come on, you love spoiling
that kid, you know it.

388
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,925
Yeah, I know, but let that be
our little secret.

389
00:16:53,969 --> 00:16:55,318
Listen, the reason
I'm calling you

390
00:16:55,362 --> 00:16:57,146
is because I got a text

391
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:00,149
from Tani, and she said
that Eddie's in a bad way.

392
00:17:00,193 --> 00:17:01,324
He's not doing too good.

393
00:17:01,368 --> 00:17:02,586
The vet just left.

394
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,935
She said she thinks it's PTS,

395
00:17:03,979 --> 00:17:05,720
but she's no expert.

396
00:17:05,763 --> 00:17:08,723
Well, fret not, pal of mine,
because I happen to know one.

397
00:17:08,766 --> 00:17:10,290
Will played high school baseball

398
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:14,250
with the son
of a resident Army veterinarian.

399
00:17:14,294 --> 00:17:17,688
And his primary expertise
is in military working dogs.

400
00:17:17,732 --> 00:17:18,820
Are you kidding me right now?

401
00:17:18,863 --> 00:17:19,951
About Eddie?

402
00:17:19,995 --> 00:17:22,084
Bite your tongue, man.
I love that dog,

403
00:17:22,128 --> 00:17:23,868
so I reached out to him.

404
00:17:23,912 --> 00:17:26,697
And he thinks he can help.
His name is Dr. Art Currin.

405
00:17:26,741 --> 00:17:30,353
You'll find him at the
Veterinary Treatment Facility

406
00:17:30,397 --> 00:17:31,746
at Fort Shafter.

407
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:34,270
And he's expecting you, too.
How about that?

408
00:17:34,314 --> 00:17:36,533
Thank you so much, Lou.
I really appreciate this.

409
00:17:36,577 --> 00:17:38,709
No problem, man.
Anything for that pup.

410
00:17:38,753 --> 00:17:41,277
All right, I got to go.
I'm late for an argument.

411
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:48,328
Shh... you're okay.
You're okay. You're okay.

412
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,417
Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh.

413
00:18:34,461 --> 00:18:36,593
You were right
to bring him in.

414
00:18:36,637 --> 00:18:39,466
Eddie is definitely
exhibiting signs of canine PTS.

415
00:18:39,509 --> 00:18:41,598
He recently
suffer any trauma

416
00:18:41,642 --> 00:18:43,383
in the field?

417
00:18:43,426 --> 00:18:45,254
No. I mean, that's the thing.

418
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:46,951
He's been, he's been
with me for, uh,

419
00:18:46,995 --> 00:18:48,257
couple years now, and

420
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:51,956
he's been exposed to, to
gunshots, to explosions,

421
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,045
uh, he's-he's never
had a bad reaction.

422
00:18:56,004 --> 00:18:58,137
Before he came to me,
he was a DEA dog.

423
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,139
And then preceding that,
he was with a Marine unit

424
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:01,488
in Afghanistan.

425
00:19:01,531 --> 00:19:04,099
I'm trying to
think what I

426
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,361
could have exposed him to.

427
00:19:05,405 --> 00:19:06,797
I've had a lot going on
in my personal life.

428
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:09,496
I-I guess, uh...

429
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:11,411
It's killing me, Doc,
to think that maybe

430
00:19:11,454 --> 00:19:13,369
I-I've exposed
him to something

431
00:19:13,413 --> 00:19:15,284
that's, that's, that's
had this reaction.

432
00:19:15,328 --> 00:19:17,547
I can tell you're hurting.

433
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:19,810
You shouldn't
beat yourself up.

434
00:19:19,854 --> 00:19:21,899
It's not uncommon
for canine PTS

435
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:26,382
to stay dormant for weeks,
months, sometimes years;

436
00:19:26,426 --> 00:19:28,210
lying dormant till something
sets it off.

437
00:19:28,254 --> 00:19:31,387
That something can be a sound,
sight, smell.

438
00:19:31,431 --> 00:19:33,476
Literally anything
can bring an old trauma

439
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,869
back to the surface.

440
00:19:34,912 --> 00:19:36,827
My guess, this didn't happen
because of something

441
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:38,307
you exposed him to.

442
00:19:38,351 --> 00:19:40,831
You would have noticed the signs
immediately if you had.

443
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,833
More likely, Eddie was alone

444
00:19:42,877 --> 00:19:44,313
when the triggering
event happened;

445
00:19:44,357 --> 00:19:47,011
in your home,
perhaps outside.

446
00:19:47,055 --> 00:19:49,057
It's not your fault, Commander.

447
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,451
Now let's
talk treatment.Mm.

448
00:19:51,494 --> 00:19:52,843
First, I'll administer
an anxiolytic

449
00:19:52,887 --> 00:19:54,541
to help with
the underlying anxiety.

450
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:58,022
Honestly, the meds
are just a band-aid.

451
00:19:58,066 --> 00:20:00,851
You're gonna have to figure out
exactly what triggered Eddie

452
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,723
and remove it
from his environment,

453
00:20:02,766 --> 00:20:06,161
or, frankly, his condition's
only gonna get worse.

454
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,771
That said,

455
00:20:07,815 --> 00:20:10,209
you can't know what you need
to remove until you determine

456
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:11,253
the root cause of this trauma.

457
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:13,081
Right.

458
00:20:13,124 --> 00:20:15,605
Lou tells me you're
a seasoned investigator.

459
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:17,868
Something like that, yeah.

460
00:20:17,912 --> 00:20:20,697
It's time to investigate this.Understood.

461
00:20:20,741 --> 00:20:23,439
Eddie's first handler...

462
00:20:23,483 --> 00:20:25,398
he was killed in action
in Afghanistan.

463
00:20:25,441 --> 00:20:27,922
You know any details about how?

464
00:20:27,965 --> 00:20:28,966
No.

465
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,272
Well, then I'd start there.

466
00:20:35,538 --> 00:20:39,063
Steve. You got
me and Quinn.

467
00:20:39,107 --> 00:20:40,413
How's the little man?

468
00:20:41,457 --> 00:20:43,242
He's all right.
He's a little quiet.

469
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:44,591
I think it's the meds.

470
00:20:44,634 --> 00:20:46,419
So the Army vet was helpful?

471
00:20:46,462 --> 00:20:47,898
He was. He was very helpful.

472
00:20:47,942 --> 00:20:49,378
But, uh, Eddie's not
out of the woods yet.

473
00:20:49,422 --> 00:20:51,989
We still need to figure out
what triggered it.

474
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:53,991
So where do we start, boss?

475
00:20:54,035 --> 00:20:57,691
We start by turning back
the clock.

476
00:20:57,734 --> 00:21:00,259
Eddie's first handler
was killed in action

477
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:01,695
in Afghanistan.
I want to know everything

478
00:21:01,738 --> 00:21:03,262
that happened that day.
Okay?

479
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:05,568
The doctor seems to think
that his trauma is rooted there,

480
00:21:05,612 --> 00:21:07,178
so let's dig around
and see if we can find

481
00:21:07,222 --> 00:21:08,354
anything actionable.

482
00:21:08,397 --> 00:21:11,357
If we can't,
look into his DEA history.

483
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,272
But my gut says

484
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:15,709
that the doctor's right, and his
trauma is linked to the death

485
00:21:15,752 --> 00:21:17,406
of his old handler.

486
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:21,671
That was a one-of-a-kind bond,
and it got broken.

487
00:21:21,715 --> 00:21:23,673
In the meantime,
I don't want to leave him alone,

488
00:21:23,717 --> 00:21:25,153
so if you guys
could do me a favor,

489
00:21:25,196 --> 00:21:27,938
I want you to go talk
to Colonel O'Donnell at MCBH.

490
00:21:27,982 --> 00:21:29,462
He should be able
to put us in contact

491
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:31,290
with Eddie's old unit. On it.

492
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,987
We'll send you an update ASAP

493
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,989
as long as you give Eddie
a belly rub from us.

494
00:21:35,032 --> 00:21:36,120
Will do.

495
00:21:37,992 --> 00:21:40,473
Hang in
there, buddy.

496
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:49,438
Okay. All right,
just relax, okay?

497
00:21:49,482 --> 00:21:51,962
Here's what we're gonna do.
I just need to get you stable.

498
00:21:52,006 --> 00:21:53,616
I'm gonna go
up the road

499
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,139
and I'm gonna flag down a car,
all right?

500
00:21:55,183 --> 00:21:56,140
We're gonna take a look.

501
00:21:56,184 --> 00:21:58,229
Okay?
Okay.

502
00:21:58,273 --> 00:21:59,796
Let me see.

503
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,451
Okay, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
No, no, no, no, no.

504
00:22:02,495 --> 00:22:05,541
I can't feel my l I can't
feel my leg, can't feel my leg.Sorry.

505
00:22:05,585 --> 00:22:07,238
It hurts everywhere. There's
something wrong with my back.

506
00:22:07,282 --> 00:22:10,459
Okay, all right, so look,
just breathe, focus on me.

507
00:22:10,503 --> 00:22:12,983
Look at me. Everything's
gonna be okay, all right?

508
00:22:13,027 --> 00:22:14,245
I'm just gonna
check you out

509
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:15,943
and see where else
you're hurt, okay?

510
00:22:15,986 --> 00:22:18,075
Yeah, you do that.
You need to do that.All right.

511
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:20,469
Lean forward a little bit,
just a little bit.

512
00:22:20,513 --> 00:22:21,862
Little bit,
little bit.

513
00:22:21,905 --> 00:22:23,646
Okay, I see it.

514
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,999
Okay.

515
00:22:29,043 --> 00:22:30,174
All right.

516
00:22:30,218 --> 00:22:32,525
All right,
stay like that.

517
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,486
What is that? What is that?It's just a little cut.

518
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,401
What was that?
What is it? Is it bad?

519
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:41,664
It's bad.No. It's just a little cut.

520
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:44,145
Just, look it, look it,
I got to get it cleaned up,

521
00:22:44,188 --> 00:22:45,755
and then we'll
be okay, all right?

522
00:22:47,104 --> 00:22:48,715
Just tell me.

523
00:22:48,758 --> 00:22:52,283
Just don't lie to me, please.
Don't lie to me now.

524
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:58,115
It's not good.

525
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,682
Okay?
It's a little bad,

526
00:22:59,726 --> 00:23:01,728
but I'm gonna fix it, all right?
I'm gonna get you stable,

527
00:23:01,771 --> 00:23:03,120
and everything's
gonna be okay.

528
00:23:03,164 --> 00:23:05,384
You are gonna make it
through this. You understand?

529
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:07,255

Yeah.

530
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:15,350
You're looking for

531
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,961
personnel information
on the dog's old unit?Yes, sir.

532
00:23:18,005 --> 00:23:20,311
Eddie, is it?
Correct.
Um, specifically,

533
00:23:20,355 --> 00:23:22,226
we would be grateful to speak
with any of the Marines

534
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,881
that were on duty the day
that Eddie's handler was killed.

535
00:23:24,925 --> 00:23:27,580
I understand.
Uh, Corporal Bollinger

536
00:23:27,623 --> 00:23:30,626
was killed
in Farah Province

537
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:33,150
on July 9, 2013.

538
00:23:33,194 --> 00:23:36,066
Of the unit on patrol,
two men died that day.

539
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,808
Another two are on
active missions

540
00:23:38,852 --> 00:23:41,158
in classified locations,
thus unreachable.

541
00:23:42,508 --> 00:23:43,770
But it looks as though
two Marines

542
00:23:43,813 --> 00:23:45,075
might be available
to make contact.

543
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:47,121
That's great.

544
00:23:47,164 --> 00:23:49,950
One has left the service.

545
00:23:49,993 --> 00:23:52,648
He's now a firefighter
in Portland.

546
00:23:52,692 --> 00:23:54,781
Uh, Maine, not Oregon.

547
00:23:54,824 --> 00:23:55,956
And the other,

548
00:23:55,999 --> 00:24:00,264
he was the unit's
radio operator.

549
00:24:00,308 --> 00:24:03,833
He's currently stationed
at Marine Wing Liaison Kadena

550
00:24:03,877 --> 00:24:05,922
at Kadena Air Base in Okinawa.

551
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:08,925
Great. Thank you
so much, Colonel.

552
00:24:08,969 --> 00:24:11,406
Happy to help.Thank you.

553
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,277
I hope the warrior's
better soon.

554
00:24:13,321 --> 00:24:14,931
Thank you, sir.

555
00:24:14,975 --> 00:24:17,934
Absolutely.

556
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:23,462
Anything?

557
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:25,812
I'm looking.

558
00:24:25,855 --> 00:24:28,336
I thought you said
this place grows on you.

559
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:31,774
It does. Do me a favor
and don't talk.

560
00:24:31,818 --> 00:24:32,993
You got to save
your energy, okay?

561
00:24:37,954 --> 00:24:40,783
There's so much blood.I know.

562
00:24:40,827 --> 00:24:43,133
I'll take care of that
right now, okay?

563
00:24:43,177 --> 00:24:45,962
Okay.Lean forward

564
00:24:46,006 --> 00:24:47,921
for me. Breathe.Mm-hmm.

565
00:24:51,141 --> 00:24:52,621
All right.

566
00:24:55,798 --> 00:24:57,539
Lean back,

567
00:24:57,583 --> 00:25:00,847
and good pressure on that, okay?

568
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:02,762
All right, we're gonna
take care of this now.

569
00:25:06,853 --> 00:25:08,028
This is probably
gonna hurt,

570
00:25:08,071 --> 00:25:09,203
but I got to stop this
bleeding, all right?

571
00:25:12,772 --> 00:25:14,687
Okay, I got it.

572
00:25:18,212 --> 00:25:20,606
Come on, come on, you're tough.

573
00:25:20,649 --> 00:25:22,346
You're tough.
Look at me.

574
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,348
Look at me.
Stay with me, okay?

575
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,700
I'm scared.

576
00:25:27,743 --> 00:25:29,832
I know you're scared,
but you don't have to be.

577
00:25:29,876 --> 00:25:32,748
You're gonna be okay.
I'm right here, all right?I don't pray.

578
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:34,968
You don't have to pray.I should pray.

579
00:25:35,011 --> 00:25:37,492
No, you don't have to pray
'cause I'm right here, okay?

580
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,147
All you got to do is hang tough.
All right? Look at me,

581
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,584
we're gonna get out of this
thing. I'm gonna go up there,

582
00:25:42,628 --> 00:25:44,543
I'm gonna flag down a car,
we're gonna go home.

583
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:48,024
Okay? Promise.
I promise.

584
00:25:48,068 --> 00:25:50,984
Don't get upset,
okay?

585
00:25:51,027 --> 00:25:53,987
You know, since we're being
honest with each other, I, um,

586
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:57,338
something I didn't tell you
that I think I should.

587
00:25:57,381 --> 00:25:58,600
You know, you said your aunt

588
00:25:58,644 --> 00:26:00,471
used to take you to,
uh, to Romeo's.

589
00:26:00,515 --> 00:26:03,257
I know Romeo's very well.
I actually got into

590
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,172
a-a fight in front of Romeo's
when I was in,

591
00:26:05,215 --> 00:26:07,000
when I was in school
when I was a kid.

592
00:26:07,043 --> 00:26:08,436
You serious right now?

593
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:10,220
Yeah. Seventh grade.
Seventh grade,

594
00:26:10,264 --> 00:26:12,658
there was these two big
high school jerks

595
00:26:12,701 --> 00:26:14,834
that were messing with my
friend, calling him fat 'cause

596
00:26:14,877 --> 00:26:16,487
I don't know,
calling him butterball.

597
00:26:16,531 --> 00:26:17,663
Well, was he fat?

598
00:26:17,706 --> 00:26:19,316
Yeah, he was very fat.

599
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,362
You know, he was,
he was a big kid.

600
00:26:21,405 --> 00:26:23,320
He used to pop zeppolis
like they were Tic Tacs.

601
00:26:23,364 --> 00:26:25,758
Anyway, it doesn't justify
the ridicule, you know?

602
00:26:25,801 --> 00:26:28,543
I agree with that.

603
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,849
What happened?

604
00:26:29,892 --> 00:26:33,853
Why, I, uh, I, uh...
They were in high school.

605
00:26:33,896 --> 00:26:35,768
They were big high school
basketball players.

606
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:39,685
They beat me up pretty good.
I got my ass kicked, you know.

607
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:43,340
You're a good guy.Thanks.

608
00:26:47,214 --> 00:26:49,695
Just got a text from
the radio op, he should be ready

609
00:26:49,738 --> 00:26:51,044
to Skype McGarrett
in a few minutes.

610
00:26:51,087 --> 00:26:53,176
Cool.

611
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,831
Eddie okay?He's restless.

612
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:59,879
He's restless. McGarrett's
trying to settle him for a nap.

613
00:26:59,922 --> 00:27:02,185
He did lap up some of the water
from the bowl

614
00:27:02,229 --> 00:27:03,796
that I brought, though, so...

615
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:06,407
Oh, that's weird. Did you tell
him the water was for Eddie?

616
00:27:10,933 --> 00:27:12,718
You want to talk about it?

617
00:27:12,761 --> 00:27:15,242
I don't know.
I Okay, fine. Yeah. Um...

618
00:27:15,285 --> 00:27:18,332
So I go upstairs, and
I'm-I'm thinking about Eddie,

619
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:19,986
and I'm-I'm worried about him.
I'm thinking about

620
00:27:20,029 --> 00:27:22,118
all the terrible things
that have happened to him.

621
00:27:22,162 --> 00:27:23,424
I'm thinking about
the trauma that

622
00:27:23,467 --> 00:27:25,469
almost got him killed today.

623
00:27:25,513 --> 00:27:27,950
And then I-I walked by
Junior's room...

624
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:31,258
Junior's not invincible either.

625
00:27:31,301 --> 00:27:33,086
And now he's off on

626
00:27:33,129 --> 00:27:35,175
his secret SEAL mission,
and I haven't

627
00:27:35,218 --> 00:27:37,307
heard from him since
the morning that he left.

628
00:27:37,351 --> 00:27:39,745
But, like, I'm-I'm-I'm trying
not to think about it.

629
00:27:39,788 --> 00:27:44,575
Um... Just...
being in this house is...

630
00:27:44,619 --> 00:27:46,926
doesn't make it easier.

631
00:27:46,969 --> 00:27:49,189
You're right.

632
00:27:49,232 --> 00:27:51,104
Junior's not invincible,

633
00:27:51,147 --> 00:27:54,281
but he is tough as hell.

634
00:27:54,324 --> 00:27:55,761
And I know that
he will do everything

635
00:27:55,804 --> 00:27:57,763
that he can to get
back home safe,

636
00:27:57,806 --> 00:28:01,331
back to the people
that he loves.

637
00:28:09,296 --> 00:28:11,951
Hey. You okay?
Hi. Yeah.

638
00:28:11,994 --> 00:28:14,257
I think he, uh, he's
finally sleeping, so...

639
00:28:14,301 --> 00:28:16,390
Okay, this is him.

640
00:28:16,433 --> 00:28:19,698
Okay, his name is
Sergeant Victor Michaels.

641
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:21,569
I brought him
up to speed.
Copy that.

642
00:28:21,612 --> 00:28:23,876
Sergeant Michaels,
can you hear me?

643
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,442
Loud and clear, Commander.

644
00:28:25,486 --> 00:28:27,314
Thank you very much for your
time today. I appreciate it.

645
00:28:27,357 --> 00:28:28,445
Hey, I always got time
for Eddie.

646
00:28:28,489 --> 00:28:29,969
Sorry to hear
what he's going through.

647
00:28:30,012 --> 00:28:32,232
Yeah,
appreciate that.

648
00:28:32,275 --> 00:28:34,713
We spoke with his doctor,
and the doctor said if we can

649
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:36,366
figure out what the-the
trigger is for him,

650
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:39,326
then maybe we can prevent this
from happening in the future.

651
00:28:39,369 --> 00:28:42,764
We're pretty sure it's connected
to the death of his handler,

652
00:28:42,808 --> 00:28:45,419
so and I'm very sorry
to ask this

653
00:28:45,462 --> 00:28:47,943
'cause I know how hard it is
but anything you could

654
00:28:47,987 --> 00:28:50,729
tell us about
that day, uh,

655
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:52,513
it'd be really helpful.

656
00:28:52,556 --> 00:28:55,821
Of course.

657
00:28:55,864 --> 00:28:57,866
That's not the kind of day
you forget.

658
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,304
As soon as we got out
of the Humvees,

659
00:29:01,348 --> 00:29:04,873
I had that...
that eerie feeling.

660
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:06,701
You know the one,

661
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,703
like there was death
in the air.

662
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,879
The area was littered
with IEDs.

663
00:29:10,923 --> 00:29:13,708
It felt like the whole place
could blow at any second.

664
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,363
Eddie, he had about
the best nose in the Corps.

665
00:29:16,406 --> 00:29:19,192
That area was a straight-up
death trap.

666
00:29:19,235 --> 00:29:21,194
All it took is
for one boot to take

667
00:29:21,237 --> 00:29:22,499
one step out
of formation, and...

668
00:29:24,719 --> 00:29:25,981
Suddenly I was on my back.

669
00:29:26,025 --> 00:29:27,809
I remember
the first thing I saw

670
00:29:27,853 --> 00:29:30,333
were purple flowers,

671
00:29:30,377 --> 00:29:32,379
covered in blood that
I thought was mine.

672
00:29:33,902 --> 00:29:35,382
And that's when
I spotted Eddie.

673
00:29:35,425 --> 00:29:38,080
He looked injured,
but then he got up.

674
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:41,388
He had to find his handler.

675
00:29:41,431 --> 00:29:43,564
Those two had a special bond.

676
00:29:56,185 --> 00:29:57,883
Bollinger
was a good man.

677
00:29:57,926 --> 00:30:01,669
I'm sure he was. I'm sorry.

678
00:30:01,712 --> 00:30:03,410
Thank you, Commander.

679
00:30:03,453 --> 00:30:05,586
I'm not sure
if any of that helps.I know, I...

680
00:30:05,629 --> 00:30:07,196
I think it really does. Listen,

681
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,850
those purple flowers
you mentioned, you remember

682
00:30:08,894 --> 00:30:10,286
what they were called?

683
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,114
Oh, yeah, they grew all over
the place in, uh, Farah.

684
00:30:12,158 --> 00:30:13,420
It's that restharrow stuff.

685
00:30:13,463 --> 00:30:14,551
Restharrow.

686
00:30:14,595 --> 00:30:16,858
Well, thank you again, Sergeant.

687
00:30:16,902 --> 00:30:20,949
Of course. And look,
you take care of that dog, sir.

688
00:30:20,993 --> 00:30:22,472
Lord knows he took care of us.

689
00:30:22,516 --> 00:30:23,647
I will.

690
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,048
See what I'm seeing?

691
00:30:33,092 --> 00:30:34,833
If you're talking about
the look of a man

692
00:30:34,876 --> 00:30:37,444
who's about to crack the code,
then that's an affirmative.

693
00:30:39,925 --> 00:30:44,146
All right,
all right.

694
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,801
Hey. I need you to lean forward.

695
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,238
I'm gonna change
these dressings, okay?

696
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:00,467
Can I ask you something?Of course.

697
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,512
Why were you in that bar?

698
00:31:02,556 --> 00:31:05,907
That's really what you want
to talk about right now?

699
00:31:05,951 --> 00:31:08,344
If I can't be rescued,
I shall be entertained.

700
00:31:08,388 --> 00:31:10,651
You are going
to be rescued, okay?

701
00:31:10,694 --> 00:31:13,567
I was in that bar

702
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:17,832
because I was in a mood
because of my ex-wife.

703
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,703
Yeah, yeah, that'll do it.

704
00:31:21,836 --> 00:31:26,319
How long you been
split up?

705
00:31:26,362 --> 00:31:29,670
If I, uh, if I try to tell you
that whole story,

706
00:31:29,713 --> 00:31:31,498
we'll both be dead
before I finish.

707
00:31:31,541 --> 00:31:35,589
We were sort of trying to
work it out the last year or so.

708
00:31:35,632 --> 00:31:37,417
Didn't take?
No, no.

709
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,245
We're better off as friends.Yeah.

710
00:31:39,288 --> 00:31:42,639
I've been there.
Yeah? You got
some stories of your own?

711
00:31:42,683 --> 00:31:44,380
Mm-hmm.
Really?

712
00:31:44,424 --> 00:31:46,078
A lady never tells.

713
00:31:46,121 --> 00:31:47,122
Ah.

714
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,300
It's a car.

715
00:31:51,344 --> 00:31:53,085
No, no, no, no. You can't
leave me, you can't leave me.Hey, look at me,

716
00:31:53,128 --> 00:31:55,043
look at me, look at me.
You're fine.You can't leave me,

717
00:31:55,087 --> 00:31:56,349
you can't go.I'll stop the car,
we get an ambulance,

718
00:31:56,392 --> 00:31:57,480
and then we go home, okay?

719
00:31:57,524 --> 00:31:58,917
That's all, that's all.Please don't go.

720
00:32:13,757 --> 00:32:15,977
Hey!

721
00:32:16,021 --> 00:32:18,284
Stop!
Hey, hey!

722
00:32:18,327 --> 00:32:19,850
Hey!

723
00:32:19,894 --> 00:32:21,374
Hey!

724
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:47,269
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

725
00:32:47,313 --> 00:32:48,575
Hey, wake up.

726
00:32:48,618 --> 00:32:50,403
Wake up, wake up.

727
00:32:50,446 --> 00:32:52,013
There you go.

728
00:32:52,057 --> 00:32:53,536
Hey, I missed the car. Okay?

729
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,581
Okay.
It's not your fault.

730
00:32:54,624 --> 00:32:56,409
Oh, thank you.

731
00:32:56,452 --> 00:32:58,324
Mm-hmm. Are you
always this unlucky?

732
00:32:58,367 --> 00:33:00,761
I was in that bar, wasn't I?
Come on.

733
00:33:00,804 --> 00:33:02,067
Mm.

734
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,633
Let me check you out here.

735
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,986
Let me see.
All right, this is good.

736
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:09,552
Let me see your back.

737
00:33:09,596 --> 00:33:12,207
Hey, you gotta stay awake
for me. Okay?

738
00:33:12,251 --> 00:33:13,252
Stay awake.

739
00:33:17,082 --> 00:33:19,301
You're out of towels.

740
00:33:19,345 --> 00:33:20,433
It's all right.

741
00:33:22,261 --> 00:33:23,305
It's gonna be okay.

742
00:33:23,349 --> 00:33:25,525
Not of we don't
stop the bleeding.

743
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,832
I got this. Gonna...

744
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,151
All right, lean back.
Lean back.

745
00:33:43,195 --> 00:33:44,326
Pressure.

746
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,024
You gotta keep pressure
on your back

747
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:47,895
and you're gonna be fine.
We're getting out of here. Okay?

748
00:33:47,938 --> 00:33:50,115
All right?

749
00:33:50,158 --> 00:33:53,683
Just breathe easy. Easy, okay?

750
00:34:10,396 --> 00:34:11,658
Excuse me.

751
00:34:11,701 --> 00:34:13,007
Hi.

752
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:16,054
Hello.
Can I help you?

753
00:34:16,097 --> 00:34:17,577
We sure hope so.
I'm Tani Rey.

754
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,839
This is Quinn Liu.

755
00:34:18,882 --> 00:34:20,319
We work with your neighbor,
Steve McGarrett.

756
00:34:20,362 --> 00:34:22,016
I hope we're
not intruding.No, not at all.

757
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,106
Steve mentioned you're
a botany professor.
I am.

758
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,107
We came from central
Connecticut,

759
00:34:26,151 --> 00:34:27,543
so this is paradise.

760
00:34:27,587 --> 00:34:29,893
The biodiversity of flora here
is incredible.

761
00:34:29,937 --> 00:34:31,460
90% of plant life
found in Hawaii

762
00:34:31,504 --> 00:34:33,158
can't be found anywhere else
in the world.

763
00:34:37,162 --> 00:34:39,120
Sorry. Uh, you obviously
didn't come by

764
00:34:39,164 --> 00:34:42,123
to hear me geek out
about plants.Actually...

765
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:45,039
Oahu's climate can support the
growth of just about anything,

766
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,128
so I've planted rare species
from all over the world.

767
00:34:47,172 --> 00:34:49,087
For my students to study
and enjoy.

768
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,567
Someday for my son, too.

769
00:34:51,611 --> 00:34:52,655
This is the one
you were asking about.

770
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:54,004
Spiny restharrow.

771
00:34:54,048 --> 00:34:55,963
Known to Latin speakers
as ononis spinosa.

772
00:34:56,006 --> 00:34:57,878
It's quite lovely,
isn't it? It is, yeah.

773
00:34:57,921 --> 00:34:59,140
So Eddie must have
gotten through the hedges

774
00:34:59,184 --> 00:35:01,403
connecting the yards,
or through the gate.

775
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:02,665
Either way,
he was nosing around,

776
00:35:02,709 --> 00:35:03,927
smelled them
and got triggered.

777
00:35:03,971 --> 00:35:05,146
I don't understand.

778
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,974
Are you talking about
Eddie, Steve's dog?

779
00:35:07,017 --> 00:35:08,149
Is he all right?

780
00:35:08,193 --> 00:35:09,281
It wouldn't be a problem
if he ingested it.

781
00:35:09,324 --> 00:35:10,760
It's not poisonous.

782
00:35:10,804 --> 00:35:13,154
It-It's not that. Um,
I'm not sure if Steve told you,

783
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:14,938
but Eddie was a military
working dog.

784
00:35:14,982 --> 00:35:16,723
He served with the Marines
in Afghanistan.

785
00:35:16,766 --> 00:35:19,552
These plants are
abundant there.

786
00:35:19,595 --> 00:35:21,902
And he suffered a combat trauma
in a field full of them.

787
00:35:21,945 --> 00:35:24,948
A couple days ago, Eddie's
canine PTS was triggered.

788
00:35:24,992 --> 00:35:29,388
And my plants were the trigger.
Oh, I feel awful.

789
00:35:29,431 --> 00:35:30,737
Oh, please.
How could you know?

790
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,912
None of us did.

791
00:35:31,955 --> 00:35:33,696
Regardless, I will
remove these right away.

792
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,959
I can call a few
of my students and have them

793
00:35:36,003 --> 00:35:38,048
help me transfer them
to the greenhouse on campus.Thank you.

794
00:35:38,092 --> 00:35:40,050
We appreciate your
understanding.

795
00:35:40,094 --> 00:35:41,748
Steve will, too.
Yeah.

796
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:43,619
Oh, come on.

797
00:35:44,968 --> 00:35:47,493
Come on, wake up.Uh, wha

798
00:35:47,536 --> 00:35:50,583
Wake up. You're okay.

799
00:35:50,626 --> 00:35:54,152
All right? Just breathe.
Just breathe.

800
00:35:54,195 --> 00:35:56,458
There you go.
That's good.

801
00:35:56,502 --> 00:35:58,068
All right, look,
you're stable right now

802
00:35:58,112 --> 00:35:59,374
and you're strong.I don't feel strong.

803
00:35:59,418 --> 00:36:00,767
All right? You're strong.

804
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:02,769
All we gotta do is
catch a break. Okay?

805
00:36:02,812 --> 00:36:04,945
That's it. That all
we gotta do, all right?

806
00:36:04,988 --> 00:36:07,295
You cold?
I'm tired.

807
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:09,210
All right. You're all right.I'm tired.
So cold.

808
00:36:09,254 --> 00:36:12,126
I know, I know.
I know, I know.

809
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,084
I know.
I know.

810
00:36:14,128 --> 00:36:15,738
Hey, I know. Come on.

811
00:36:15,782 --> 00:36:17,392
Come on, won't you come on?

812
00:36:17,436 --> 00:36:19,002
Okay.Okay, good.

813
00:36:19,046 --> 00:36:20,613
Can't stay awake.Okay.

814
00:36:20,656 --> 00:36:24,007
Can't stay awake.
No...

815
00:36:24,051 --> 00:36:25,139
All right.

816
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,228
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

817
00:36:27,272 --> 00:36:29,143
Come o

818
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,145

Come on!

819
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,103
Somebody!

820
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:41,460
Come on!

821
00:36:41,503 --> 00:36:43,418
Come on!

822
00:36:45,507 --> 00:36:48,510
Wake up!
Come on!

823
00:36:48,554 --> 00:36:50,991
Come on!

824
00:36:57,389 --> 00:36:59,695
Hey.

825
00:36:59,739 --> 00:37:01,958
You hear that?Don't miss this one.

826
00:37:17,322 --> 00:37:19,628
Hey, I'm a cop.
I need to use your radio

827
00:37:19,672 --> 00:37:20,847
to call an ambulance.

828
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:22,196
Of course.

829
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,806
Channel nine.

830
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:26,418
Is it good?
Yeah.

831
00:37:26,461 --> 00:37:29,508
All right, this is
Detective Danny Williams

832
00:37:29,551 --> 00:37:30,770
with the Five-O Task Force.

833
00:37:30,813 --> 00:37:33,686
I need an ambulance,
uh, Waianae Valley Road,

834
00:37:33,729 --> 00:37:36,732
about a mile past Haleahi.

835
00:37:36,776 --> 00:37:41,041
Um, got life-threatening
injuries sustained by a female.

836
00:37:41,084 --> 00:37:42,869
She's lost a lot of blood.
I need an ambulance immediately.

837
00:37:42,912 --> 00:37:44,305
Copy, Detective.

838
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:46,873
Sending paramedic units
to your location right away.

839
00:37:46,916 --> 00:37:49,571
Right now, right now, please.
Thanks.

840
00:37:51,399 --> 00:37:55,273
Aw, look at you two.
Love is real.

841
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:56,883
Yeah, you know, uh, I think
romcoms want us to believe

842
00:37:56,926 --> 00:37:58,972
that a race to the airport
tops the list

843
00:37:59,015 --> 00:38:00,365
of romantic gestures,

844
00:38:00,408 --> 00:38:03,585
but I believe that
dodging traffic has that beat.

845
00:38:03,629 --> 00:38:05,413
Not to mention I always thought
chasing somebody to the airport

846
00:38:05,457 --> 00:38:06,806
was a little psycho.

847
00:38:08,808 --> 00:38:10,810
You know, it's strange,
out there this morning

848
00:38:10,853 --> 00:38:11,854
in the traffic,

849
00:38:11,898 --> 00:38:13,116
where Eddie made
eye contact with me,

850
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,294
and I could see his panic
and his fear,

851
00:38:16,337 --> 00:38:18,121
not knowing
which way to turn.

852
00:38:18,165 --> 00:38:19,688
And I swear to God,
I could relate.

853
00:38:21,647 --> 00:38:25,128
And after everything
that's happened this year...

854
00:38:25,172 --> 00:38:27,130
that's exactly
where I would be

855
00:38:27,174 --> 00:38:29,872
if I didn't have this dog
to lean on every day.

856
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:31,483
If I didn't have all of you.

857
00:38:31,526 --> 00:38:32,962
Not going anywhere, Steve.

858
00:38:33,006 --> 00:38:34,312
Yeah, ditto.

859
00:38:34,355 --> 00:38:36,444
And I don't think
young Edward here

860
00:38:36,488 --> 00:38:38,141
is gonna be moving
for the next 18 hours.

861
00:38:38,185 --> 00:38:40,840
So I hope you're comfortable.

862
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,321
By the way, um,

863
00:38:43,364 --> 00:38:45,018
how's Danny doing?

864
00:38:45,061 --> 00:38:47,455
I heard he was taking
a few days.

865
00:38:47,499 --> 00:38:50,328
I spoke to him this morning.
He's good.

866
00:38:51,938 --> 00:38:53,896
Oh, maybe that's him now.

867
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,334
Not unless he forgot his key.

868
00:39:08,868 --> 00:39:10,391
Adam.

869
00:39:10,435 --> 00:39:11,610
Hey.

870
00:39:11,653 --> 00:39:13,960
It's been a minute.

871
00:39:15,701 --> 00:39:17,093
Yeah, I, uh...

872
00:39:17,137 --> 00:39:19,574
I'm sorry I was gone so long.

873
00:39:21,054 --> 00:39:24,013
I just, um...

874
00:39:24,057 --> 00:39:26,146
I just had to get away.

875
00:39:27,626 --> 00:39:28,627
Clear my head.

876
00:39:32,892 --> 00:39:35,024
I get it.

877
00:39:35,068 --> 00:39:36,896
Welcome home, bro.

878
00:39:54,348 --> 00:39:56,002
Hey, hey...

879
00:39:56,045 --> 00:39:59,353
Hey. Hey. Good news.
Ambulance is on the way.

880
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,311
Huh?

881
00:40:01,355 --> 00:40:03,052
Okay? So you gotta
stay awake.

882
00:40:03,096 --> 00:40:04,489
All right?

883
00:40:04,532 --> 00:40:08,231
Okay. Okay, there you go.

884
00:40:08,275 --> 00:40:10,190
What's so funny?What's so funny?

885
00:40:10,233 --> 00:40:11,844
I got, I got the luck,
like you said.

886
00:40:11,887 --> 00:40:13,889
I meet the girl of my dreams,
and I get into a car accident.

887
00:40:15,543 --> 00:40:17,545
Ah, you're okay.

888
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:19,591
Things are gonna
work out for you.

889
00:40:19,634 --> 00:40:22,028
Yeah. Yeah.

890
00:40:23,638 --> 00:40:25,466
Stay awake.

891
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,250
Hey, you never
told me your name.

892
00:40:27,294 --> 00:40:29,601
My name? My name is Danny.

893
00:40:29,644 --> 00:40:33,605
My name's Danny. You gonna
tell me your name now?

894
00:40:34,606 --> 00:40:36,956
Huh?

895
00:40:41,264 --> 00:40:43,223
Huh?

896
00:40:43,266 --> 00:40:44,398
No, no.
Hey, hey.

897
00:40:49,403 --> 00:40:51,884
Wake up. Wake

898
00:40:51,927 --> 00:40:53,015
Wake up.

00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,040
[dramatic opera music playing]

2
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,520
-[music fading]
-Oi! Somebody help us.

3
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,880
Somebody save my baby girl!

4
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,440
[man] Doctor!

5
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,160
[phone ringing faintly]

6
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,320
[man on PA] Patient 293, please.

7
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,840
[chuckles] Oh, shame.

8
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,720
Ow.

9
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,320
The NHS is rubbish.

10
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,120
Yeah. Don't say that, yeah.

11
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,520
It's not the NHS's fault they've been
stripped of their funding and...

12
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,240
It's all these time wasters anyway.
Look at them.

13
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,040
You can't be that judgemental.

14
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,040
Verrucas, mate, yeah?

15
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,600
Mr sniffles over here.

16
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,280
And what's wrong with you, big man?

17
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,400
Ah! Oh, shit.

18
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,720
-Ugh.
-[Mobeen] You need to be here.

19
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,640
You'll be all right, won't you, bro, eh?

20
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,240
[man screaming]

21
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,320
[blows] Does it go there, yeah?

22
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,040
[man screaming]

23
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,360
Oh!

24
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,720
[chuckles nervously]

25
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,960
That was wicked.

26
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,000
Finally. Right, so here's the deal.
This girl is...

27
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,200
Look. Sorry, I'm a bit busy at the moment.

28
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,000
It's okay. It's okay.

29
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,480
They're busy, mate.
They work really hard this lot.

30
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,640
You all right, beta?

31
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,360
[Aks] No. Not really.

32
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,680
He's on eBay.

33
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,720
Huh?

34
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,120
He's on fucking eBay.

35
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,960
Craig, is it?

36
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,600
We really hope
you're the winning bidder on...

37
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,120
that signed plastic cast
of Daniel Radcliffe's penis, yeah?

38
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,800
But the thing is,
my sister's got some broken bones,

39
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,360
so could you check us in?

40
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,200
[yelling] Before I break some of yours,
Craig?

41
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,200
We have a zero tolerance policy
on threats of violence towards NHS staff.

42
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,280
Is that right? Is that right?

43
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,160
Well, you ain't really NHS staff,
are you, Craig? Huh?

44
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,400
You're the freelance.

45
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,760
Earning twice as much money

46
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,640
as the people who do
the real work in here.

47
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,640
[Nate] Fraud.

48
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,960
Yeah, and I want my panda
from this trolley as well.

49
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,680
What? It's not his job.

50
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,560
-No, but I want it back.
-All right. All right.

51
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,320
Look, I'll help you, okay?

52
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,560
It's just what you said just then...

53
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,520
well that... that really hurt my feelings.

54
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,280
Sorry.

55
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,640
Please take a ticket,

56
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,120
wait for your number to be called,

57
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,240
and good luck finding a seat.

58
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,760
[Craig] I've missed it, now!

59
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,200
These places make me nervous.

60
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,040
You? I've just spent half an hour

61
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,280
being pushed down the bus lane
in a shopping trolley.

62
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,240
-So ungrateful.
-Oi.

63
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,080
They're full of germs and sick people.

64
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,080
I wish you were never born.

65
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,400
I wish you were dead.

66
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,240
It'll be fine as long as I stay clean.

67
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,640
It'll be fine.

68
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,160
And so does Mobeen as well.

69
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,800
Shut up, please.
[speaking foreign language]

70
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,320
Yo, we were better off in Kids A&E.

71
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,960
Well, that kid's fine.

72
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,040
You unplugged his respirator.

73
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,480
Yeah, to charge my phone.

74
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,800
Shut up!

75
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,720
Just a reminder. I've got broken bones
and I'm in a shopping trolley.

76
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,680
We were having a wicked time until

77
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,800
Miss Injury-Fake-Ardinian made
us come to the hospital for nothing.

78
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,400
[speaking foreign language]

79
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,760
Not now. Relax.

80
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,359
Hey, hey, family.

81
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,320
Everything's going to be okay, all right?

82
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,760
Just watch something on your phone.

83
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,560
[Mobeen] How you feeling, baby girl?
You okay?

84
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,200
It hurts, but I'll survive.

85
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,000
-You're so brave.
-Ouch!

86
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,920
Oh, I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,560
I told you he wishes you were dead.

88
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,440
-[muttering]
-No, no, no. Just...

89
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,040
Just leave it. Leave him, okay?

90
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,320
[chuckles]

91
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,280
The rock bottom's about economics.

92
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,680
No, that's just a wrestling move.

93
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,240
Shut up, you jabronies.

94
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,440
Yeah, you tell them, Mr Tumble.
[chuckling]

95
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,400
[woman] Aqsadine?

96
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,440
Mobeen.

97
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,000
I've learned how to say good bye
in sign language now.

98
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,400
What?

99
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,000
-Where you going?
-With you.

100
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,000
No, you ain't. The nurse will assess me.

101
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,120
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm coming
to make sure you're okay.

102
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,440
I don't need you there.

103
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,520
Why?

104
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,920
-Because...
-Hmm?

105
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,480
...I'll have to take my shirt off.

106
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,440
Oh!

107
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,160
Oh, yeah, you go from here.

108
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,920
Make sure you close the curtains though,
baby girl,

109
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,600
'cause A&E's full of perverts and weirdos.

110
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,680
Yeah, you heard me, Craig.

111
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,360
[sighs]

112
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,520
-Mobe's.
-Uh-huh.

113
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,680
-I've been thinking.
-Hmm.

114
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,520
What we going to say
when they ask how she got injured?

115
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,200
We're just going to tell the truth.
We got nothing to hide.

116
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,040
Yeah, we were wrestling with her
in the garden.

117
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,240
Yeah, just three grown men wrestling.

118
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,160
Yeah.

119
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,040
With a 15-year-old girl.

120
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,080
Yeah.

121
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,000
We're going straight to prison.

122
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,880
You're going to have some different things
on your hands in prison.

123
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,000
You understand?

124
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,880
I'm telling you right now,
we can not tell the truth.

125
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,720
Look, stop panicking.

126
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,080
The only reason why you're panicking
is 'cause of the way

127
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,120
the media's conditioned everyone to think
about young girls

128
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,840
and all ethnic minority men.
Come on, man.

129
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,600
Facts, we're just going to hit them
with the facts. Yeah?

130
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,000
We were wrestling with my little sister
like we always do.

131
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,320
With my shorts on.

132
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,160
Okay. She'd climbed on the wheelie bin,

133
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,880
jumped off, bust up the shoulder there,

134
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,840
and we brought her into A&E

135
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,120
because her parents ran away
to Pakistan without notifying anyone.

136
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,080
You might as well say
she got injured training for the Taliban.

137
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,720
Come on. You're just overreacting, mate.
Come on, man.

138
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,920
Listen, Mobe's.

139
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,560
If they think this is a boogie situation,
they're going to start snooping around.

140
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,640
Well, let them snoop.

141
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,960
We ain't got nothing to hide, bro.

142
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,320
Yeah, except you used to be a drug dealer.

143
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,240
[both] Shh.

144
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,320
Mobeen is an upstanding Christian--

145
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,080
Muslim and a responsible legal guardian.

146
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,120
Yeah, that's me, the... huh?
Legal guardian?

147
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,200
Yeah. Yeah, I'm her legal guardian.

148
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,120
-Hey, put your headphones in.
-Huh?

149
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,520
Put your headphones in.

150
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,280
-[whispers] Mobe's.
-Yeah?

151
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,080
Mobeen.

152
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,360
Okay, no. No, I'm not technically
her legal guardian.

153
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,240
-What?
-Bro, listen. Listen, listen.

154
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,240
Those fees are so expensive!

155
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,960
[sighs] And what does
Aks think about that?

156
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,760
-Yeah, she doesn't know yet, so...
-Oh!

157
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,480
Hey.

158
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,360
Come on, don't be angry.

159
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,040
[Nate] I'm not angry.

160
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,240
Okay. Good.

161
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,400
Just disappointed.

162
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,640
Look, come on. Don't be disappointed
with me. Please don't be in a mood.

163
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,960
Oh, you'll know when I'm in a mood
with you, Mobeen. You'll know.

164
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,400
They could take her away, you know?

165
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,160
-[Eight] Go on.
-I'm gonna Khabib this thing

166
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,560
Yeah, yeah.

167
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,480
-[thuds]
-[groans]

168
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,200
-It came out!
-It came out!

169
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,640
[Eight exclaiming in Urdu]

170
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,880
-That's for you, beta.
-Thanks.

171
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,720
-[Nate] Can you get me a Starburst?
-[Eight] Get in there.

172
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
Shall I? Shall I Khabib it?

173
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,040
Yeah Khabib it, go on.

174
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,080
-[thuds]
-[Eight] Ah!

175
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,360
-Yeah! It came out!
-[all exclaiming]

176
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,840
Which one is it? What came out?

177
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,760
Uh, I don't know if it came.
I should've...

178
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,320
Pakistan the shit out of this machine.
Come on. [grunting]

179
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,640
[Nate] Mobes.

180
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,800
[Mobeen panting]

181
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,800
Oh, my man.

182
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That's a very descriptive tattoo.

183
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,760
It's not a tattoo, is it?
It's permanent marker.

184
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,360
Cause you wanted to save money
on a tattoo,

185
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,840
but still have the ability to go swimming

186
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,399
with the words "dick tickler" written
across your forehead, yeah?

187
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,280
It's not your job title, is it?

188
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,960
Are there any vacancies?

189
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,080
[stammers] No, it's just the lads having
a bit of a laugh for just...

190
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,320
It won't come off and I start
my new job on Monday morning.

191
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,800
Doing what?

192
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,720
Uh, supply teacher, so...

193
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,960
Yeah.

194
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,200
Then you also finish your new job
on Monday, don't you?

195
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,800
-Yeah.
-Is it just your own?

196
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,840
Or do you have to tickle
other peoples' as well?

197
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,960
What? I don't know what you...

198
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,040
Baby girl. What took you so long?

199
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,400
They need to X-ray it,
but it'll take ages and there's no beds.

200
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,880
But you're okay though, aren't you?

201
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,320
Well, this doctor lady came in

202
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,960
and started asking me some
weird questions about you lot.

203
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,320
What do you mean?

204
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,080
I can't go to prison.
My face is too kind.

205
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,600
What did she say?

206
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,320
Yeah, what... what did she say?

207
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,440
Loads of stuff at first, but...

208
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,960
I think that she thinks

209
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,000
one of you lot did this to me on purpose.

210
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,120
[exclaims in Urdu]

211
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,880
I'd make a terrible boyfriend in prison.

212
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,320
No, you wouldn't. Don't say that.

213
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,880
Anyway. Did you tell her the truth?

214
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,200
That I was wrestling my brother
and his two mates?

215
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,840
That you lost at wrestling.
At least tell it properly.

216
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,040
Wrestling with grown men
sounds mad creepy out loud.

217
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,920
Yeah, it does sound
a bit creepy, actually.

218
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,520
Yo. Please.

219
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,120
So, what did you say?

220
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,520
I stuttered at first,
but then I came up with this sick alibi.

221
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,840
Yeah, you did, baby girl.

222
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,120
What did you say?
What did you tell them?

223
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,680
Gentlemen. Can I have a word
with you all, please?

224
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,640
-Oh, shit.
-Ah, I'm not with them.

225
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,880
I was just using the vending machine.

226
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,800
Shit.

227
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,240
What are you worried about?

228
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,680
I don't know.

229
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,840
So, how did Aqsadine sustain her injuries?

230
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,920
What did she tell you?

231
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,280
If you tell me what she said,
I'll tell you what I said.

232
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,640
Right.

233
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,560
Let's not worry about my version.
What my sister's version is?

234
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,080
Well, I think she's making it up.

235
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,240
Would you believe me
if I said we were wrestling?

236
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,160
[chuckles nervously]

237
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,440
Did I tell you about the tiger?

238
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,840
A tiger.

239
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,840
What did she say happened?

240
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,360
...and it jumped through the air
like a mad tiger bastard.

241
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,200
What?

242
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,040
[sighs] You can check my record.

243
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,800
I've never been involved
in anything illegal, I swear.

244
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,120
Mr Obidi, I'm a doctor.

245
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,360
Then I was like, Mobeen, run.

246
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,360
Get Aqsa out of here.

247
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,520
Let's have this conversation...

248
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,840
at Dixy Chicken's. How about that?

249
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,520
Are you flirting with me?

250
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,560
No, I'm not doing that.

251
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,080
-Mr Dee.
-Uh-uh.

252
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,640
Mobeen!

253
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,240
[Mobeen sighs]

254
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,320
[yelling] A tiger?

255
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,680
[speaking Hindi]

256
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,600
Why?

257
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,920
Why?

258
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,040
Life... Life of Pi.

259
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,400
Ugh, you're an idiot.

260
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,120
You didn't do
too much better yourself, either.

261
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,360
You were in there making us look
guilty as shit.

262
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,480
What did you say?

263
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,240
Oh, my God.

264
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,680
Guys...

265
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,520
I'm... I'm going to lose her, innit?

266
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,720
That's what's going to happen here.
I'm going to lose her.

267
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,720
I can't do this right now.
We need some time apart.

268
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,680
What?

269
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,920
No, Mobe's.

270
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,760
No, no. No, we need some time apart.

271
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,920
-Mobe's, I can change.
-You're very strong.

272
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,480
We need some time apart.

273
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,720
Let go!

274
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,280
What shall we do now?

275
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,800
I...

276
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,320
I need to poo.

277
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,200
[sighs]

278
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,920
I can't believe I forgot to renew my Bupa.

279
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,560
I mean, this place is a fucking shambles,
buddy.

280
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,960
It's crazy in here.

281
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,280
So what you in for, fella?

282
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,320
Ah, banged my bonce...
[chuckles] on a barge on Simmo's stag do.

283
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,360
[chuckling] Luckily,
I brought my own medicine.

284
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,120
[speaking gibberish and laughing]

285
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,440
Long ass waiting times in here tonight.

286
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,160
To be fair, you can't blame them, can you?

287
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,480
They've had their funding cut,
they're under-resourced.

288
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,680
Erm... is it?

289
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,400
Is it though, buddy?
Is it under-resourcing, or is it...

290
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,160
[whispers] something else?

291
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,280
[breathing heavily]

292
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,720
Indeed.

293
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,080
Indeed, it... Is it something else...

294
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,840
-or is it someone else?
-Yes, exactly.

295
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,480
Exactly. I mean, you're not
one of them, though, are you?

296
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,920
I mean, you were...
you were born here right?

297
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,560
Oh, absolutely, yeah.

298
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,440
I was born and raised in Birmingham.
Yeah, yeah.

299
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,880
I think you'll find
I'm one of the good ones.

300
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,120
Yes, you are. I knew you were.
Good man. Right.

301
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,920
-One word for you.
-Uh-huh.

302
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,400
Brexit.

303
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,040
Well...

304
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,240
I've got two words for you.

305
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,400
-Love it.
-[laughs] Fan-bloody-tastic.

306
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,840
Fan-bloody-tastic.

307
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,280
You know, I just think
the great thing is now,

308
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,640
we can have an open,
honest discussion

309
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,800
about immigration.

310
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,880
Absolute... absolutely.

311
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,400
You know what? Now, we've had it...

312
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,920
[whispers] let's send the bastards back.

313
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,160
Yes!

314
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,520
God, how fucking refreshing.

315
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,240
I mean, from someone of your...

316
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,880
-But, hey, look.
-Mmm-hmm.

317
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,000
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not a racist, buddy.

318
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,400
Of course not.

319
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,000
You haven't got an issue
with trousers of colour,

320
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,680
why would you have an issue
with people of colour?

321
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,480
[laughs] Exactly. Trousers and...

322
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,720
Exactly. That's a good one.

323
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,480
I'm going to steal that,
if you don't mind.

324
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,640
-[chuckles]
-Breader.

325
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,480
[both chuckle]

326
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,840
Boom! [imitates explosion]

327
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,080
-Oh!
-[sighs]

328
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,280
Hey, big guy.

329
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,280
Are you ready to be a family again?

330
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,960
Of course.

331
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,600
Any news?

332
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,320
Yeah, she's had the X-ray.

333
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,040
She waiting for a sling now.

334
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,800
Hey, listen to me, I'm worried for real.

335
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,160
She'll be fine.

336
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,200
Not about her,
but these hospital staffs, man.

337
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,840
Them lot think we hurt her for real,
for real.

338
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,240
-Do you know what we need?
-Yeah, a lawyer.

339
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,280
No, some time apart.
Let's see how you like it.

340
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,680
Hey.

341
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,640
Only joking. Do you want a Twix?

342
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,200
Oh, yeah. All right. Yeah.

343
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,600
Me, sore head.

344
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,400
You, no fix.

345
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,440
Me wait very, very long time.

346
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,160
Okay, right.

347
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,240
[sighs] Still haven't bloody been seen.

348
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,280
Surprise... sur-fucking surprise.

349
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,280
You know, I don't know where
you'd find more foreigners,

350
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,840
the patients or the bloody staff.

351
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,080
What have you and Simmo been putting
in that flask, Rafe?

352
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,560
Liquid racism, yeah?

353
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,320
You know... Sorry, could somebody tell me
which bloody country we are in again?

354
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,000
Hard to tell, innit?
Hard to tell though, Rafe.

355
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,600
What with all the Eastern European
radiographers

356
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,880
and the Nigerian consultants
sorting you out.

357
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,240
Sorry, buddy. Am I detecting
a hint of aggression there?

358
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,719
Oh, bloody... I thought we were on
the same bloody page.

359
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,799
Same page?

360
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,880
Motherfucker, we're not even
in the same book.

361
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,840
-Sorry about the swearing, all right?
-That's okay. He's an asshole.

362
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,200
Oh, I see. All right, I get it.

363
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:24,399
You know, the trouble with you people,
you're all the bloody same.

364
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,320
You're right, Rafe.
We are the same, innit?

365
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,280
We're all sick of posh pricks like you
running our government and our media.

366
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,360
Posh? Whoever said I was posh?

367
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,120
Mr Forbes Plunket.

368
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,960
-Thank you.
-Is that you, yeah?

369
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,440
-Yeah.
-Is that you?

370
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,400
See you later,
you double-barrelled dickhead.

371
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,560
Don't shove your willy
in any pigs heads on the way down.

372
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,360
You know, I wouldn't stick my willy
in a pigs head,

373
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,640
'cause I'd use its vagina,
like a gentleman.

374
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,640
[chuckles]

375
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,400
Dr Lange.

376
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,840
[sniffs]

377
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,920
She won't be too long.

378
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,600
How long do you think she'll take?

379
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,640
I don't... I don't know.

380
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,080
All right, just calm down, all right?
Relax.

381
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,440
-I'm okay. I'm okay.
-Just relax.

382
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,680
I'm okay. Stop man-handling today.

383
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,680
Mobeen. [chuckles]

384
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,280
Aqsa. Hey. Hey, you okay?

385
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,880
Yeah, they've sorted it.

386
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,680
Okay, let's go home. Let's go home.

387
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,400
I'm afraid I can't quite
release your sister just yet.

388
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,840
Sorry, and why is that?

389
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,160
There are a few more details
we need to iron out.

390
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,240
And what are these details, sorry?

391
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,680
Just about following certain procedures.

392
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,400
Moonbeam.

393
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,200
Oh, I'm going to run.
I'm going to run.

394
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,240
[grunting] No. No.

395
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,520
These procedures.

396
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,240
Now, I really need to poo.

397
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,560
It's always about pooing with you,
isn't it, Nathaniel?

398
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,960
Oh, shit.

399
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,760
Finally, about bloody time.

400
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,320
You're not a doctor.

401
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,800
-What?
-Nothing.

402
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,720
This man will take care of you, okay?

403
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,520
Yeah. Yeah, I will.

404
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,480
And of course it's a brown one.

405
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,720
Thank you.

406
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,000
[Mobeen] What did you call him for, huh?

407
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,160
He should be dealing with real criminals,
not law-abiding citizens like us.

408
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,520
Law-abiding. Behave.

409
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,080
I called him because you lied.

410
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,920
Lied? Who... Did you lie?

411
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,720
Cause I ain't lying, so who's lying?
Go on.

412
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,120
Well, either you lied, or there's
a fucking tiger loose in Small Heath.

413
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,600
-Maybe there is.
-A tiger?

414
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,800
What is this, Life of Pi?

415
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,160
You are not taking her away from me.
Simple as that.

416
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,880
Woah, woah, woah. Who's talking about
taking people away from you?

417
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,280
She's talking about that, bro.

418
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,560
If this is domestic abuse and one of them
inflicted this injury on her,

419
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,440
then clearly he is not capable
of being her carer.

420
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,680
-Domestic abuse on his sister?
-[Dr Tanner] Yeah.

421
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,400
[Mobeen] Oh, come on, Harpes.

422
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,080
No chance.

423
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,000
-[exhales heavily]
-[Harper] If you'd have told me

424
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,240
she'd broke his collarbone with a flask,
I'd have believed you.

425
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,920
-She has previous.
-[Mobeen] Yeah.

426
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,360
-You're my guy, you know.
-Don't touch me.

427
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,440
Sorry about that.

428
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,280
[humming]

429
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,880
Where have you been?

430
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,600
Operate... Operation.

431
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,160
[Harper] Listen, to get to the bottom
of this, we need the truth.

432
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,560
How did she break her neck?

433
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,440
-Okay, so--
-The truth, Maybelline.

434
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,840
Nathaniel, speak.

435
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,280
Speak right now or you're going to prison.

436
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,240
We were playing WWE,

437
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,000
then she stood on a bin
and she fell off the bin,

438
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,520
and then we pushed her in a trolley
in the bus lane,

439
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,120
and it was an accident.

440
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,440
-[sighs]
-And...

441
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,880
And then I tried to tombstone her.

442
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,760
[speaking foreign language]

443
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,280
And you're just going
to take their word for it?

444
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,720
Yeah, he is.

445
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,920
Shut up.

446
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,680
-Harper?
-Shut up.

447
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,800
Aztlan, give me your phone.

448
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,640
He films every little thing this lot do.

449
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,320
I do want to film Mobeen--

450
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,360
And we just press play.

451
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,600
[Mobeen laughing]

452
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,560
-[Aks screams]
-[Mobeen] Oh, Aqsa...

453
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,840
[Eight] Did I get it?

454
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,000
Well...

455
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,040
thank you for wasting everybody's time.

456
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,600
Yeah, lads,
it's not just NHS time you've wasted,

457
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,440
it's also police time, so...

458
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,280
Can you piss off, dick tickler?

459
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,760
Right-o.

460
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,240
Well, there you go, Dr T, huh?

461
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,640
Confirmation from Mr Officer Harper--

462
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,040
-Don't touch me.
-Sorry about that.

463
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,840
Now, I am more than capable
of looking after my little sister.

464
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,920
-Ouch!
-Oh, sorry, baby girl.

465
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,040
[man groaning] Oh, God.

466
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,560
Ah, Officer. Officer, please help.

467
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,320
I came into this hospital
with a mild concussion

468
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,240
and a consultant has just
sown up my arsehole--

469
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,280
Oh, fuck.

470
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,240
[groaning]

471
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,200
-I wanted to be like Dr Lange.
-Uh-huh.

472
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,760
[chuckles]

473
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,160
I'm off. You deal
with the human centipede.

474
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,520
Please. I'm losing a lot of blood
from the anus.

475
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,920
Come with me.

476
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,960
Hey, Rafe. Why don't you take a seat?

477
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,880
I can't take a... because all the blood's
falling out of my...

478
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,000
-Follow me.
-It's a fucking travesty back there.

479
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,240
[Dr Tanner] Follow me.

480
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,520
[man] Like an f-ing war zone. Slow down.

481
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,720
Did you do that?

482
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,880
Did I do good?

483
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,920
You did wicked.

484
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,160
Yes! Wicked!

485
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,920
Such an asshole.

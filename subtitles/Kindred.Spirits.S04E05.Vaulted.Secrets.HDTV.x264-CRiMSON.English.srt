1
00:00:01,635 --> 00:00:04,670
Coffins and bodies were
floating down this river.

2
00:00:04,672 --> 00:00:07,139
Lot of shadowy figures
coming up here,

3
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:09,675
it's not something
I like to do by myself.

4
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:12,578
He was just up there
looking down on you.
He knows.

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,280
Do you have any regrets
on what happened?

6
00:00:17,952 --> 00:00:20,219
I'm the boss, do what I say.

7
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:22,287
- Okay.
- Do what I say.

8
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,690
We have a gentleman that comes
down the steps,

9
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:27,726
he's not a man,
you can see through him.

10
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:29,962
My god.

11
00:00:29,964 --> 00:00:33,065
That's going off. Everything is
literally going crazy in here.

12
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:34,800
What the ****
is happening right here?

13
00:00:34,802 --> 00:00:35,968
The dead want a voice.

14
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,870
We just
want to help this family.

15
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:39,071
The living need our help.

16
00:00:39,073 --> 00:00:40,572
Have you always been here?

17
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:42,041
He was watching already.

18
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,528
we'd been to derby,
connecticut before.
We have.

19
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,963
And this time
we are investigating

20
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:06,632
the twisted vine restaurant,

21
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:09,068
which is the former
birmingham national bank.

22
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,037
It was the bank
for a number of years

23
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:14,306
and then in the '70s it was
converted to a restaurant.

24
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:18,410
they have a lot of activity

25
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:21,413
and they have been having it
for a decade.

26
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,382
I know that the activity
that they're having here

27
00:01:23,384 --> 00:01:26,318
is all the time, things are
being thrown, they heard voices,

28
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,987
they see apparitions,
and it affects people that work

29
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:31,924
and it affects people that
kind of eat there, too, right?

30
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:33,092
Yeah, and that's just it.

31
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:34,126
I think mike, the owner,

32
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:35,327
he wants to know
what's going on.

33
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:38,397
He's had staff members
run out after closing

34
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:40,232
because something happens.

35
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:43,735
And the activity, like,
it's increasing in frequency.

36
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:48,107
wasn't there a flood here?

37
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:51,710
Yes, there was a massive flood
in derby in 1955,

38
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:53,512
there were
a number of casualties.

39
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:55,314
Probably one of the more grim
things that happened

40
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:58,383
was the floodwaters
overtook some cemeteries

41
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:00,085
that were further up river,

42
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:03,889
and coffins and bodies
were floating down this river.

43
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:07,960
If all of that debris
and rubble and death

44
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:09,595
was coming down this river

45
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:13,432
and just sort of settled here,
what did that leave behind?
I don't know.

46
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,320
- hey, hi, how are you? Welcome.
- Hi.

47
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:39,591
This is quite the building.

48
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:42,261
Actually this building
was a birmingham national bank

49
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:44,196
that was built in 1892.

50
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:45,697
So was it directly from a bank

51
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:46,832
or did it have any other
incarnations?

52
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:49,568
Went directly from a bank
to a restaurant

53
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,570
in the late '70s early '80s.

54
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:52,871
Okay, and so then
it looks like a lot

55
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:55,274
of these furnishings
are original to the bank.

56
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:58,343
When it was originally a bank,
it had a huge cathedral ceiling,

57
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,645
which is still up
in the attic.

58
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:00,879
- Wow.
- Okay.

59
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,548
And the windows
are original to the bank,

60
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,217
the vault's original
to the bank is as well.

61
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:07,886
Now as far as, like, original
artifacts from the bank,

62
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:10,222
do you have anything
from the bank?

63
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:12,758
Yeah, we have actually
a bank check,

64
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,992
if you'd like to see it
I can get it.

65
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:15,093
Yeah, for sure.

66
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:18,297
Sorry.

67
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:21,066
This is an original bank
check from 1873.

68
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:22,234
Wow.

69
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:24,303
Wow, that's cool.
That's really neat.

70
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:26,905
Obviously we're here for,
yes, the history,

71
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:29,074
but we're also here
for the activity,

72
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:30,275
the paranormal activity
that's happening here.

73
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:31,743
Have you ever had
any experiences?

74
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,378
We've had things moved around.

75
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,515
We've had voices and nobody
was in the place yet.

76
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:37,716
Wow, okay.

77
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,818
We've had customers say
they've seen images

78
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,587
while they were here.

79
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:44,089
Have you ever had people
who are dining here

80
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:48,060
that kind of up and leave
because of the activity?
Quite often.

81
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:52,030
Wow. So, I mean, imagine
if it picks up and gets worse.

82
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:53,532
Like, what would it --
I mean, you don't want

83
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:56,034
that reputation, obviously,
because then nobody would come.

84
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,536
Absolutely.
We definitely wouldn't, like,

85
00:03:57,538 --> 00:03:59,338
want that reputation, for sure.
- Sure.

86
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,506
Okay, so as far as
the paranormal experiences go,

87
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,342
is there anyone else
we should talk to?

88
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:04,843
Stacy would be
a great candidate.
Yeah.

89
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:06,878
All right, so where
can we find stacy?

90
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,146
She's right downstairs.

91
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:09,481
- Okay.
- After you.

92
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,794
amy and adam, thanks so much.
And here's stacy.

93
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:25,297
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

94
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:28,300
So what kind of activity
is happening in this space

95
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:31,637
that has made you want us
to come and figure it out.

96
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:34,072
Well, we have a gentleman
that comes down the steps

97
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:37,042
that you guys came down,
lands on the landing down there,

98
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:39,978
and then you realize
he's not a man,

99
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,581
he's -- you could
see through them.

100
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,616
You could tell
he's not from now.

101
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,285
- Okay.
- He's from the past.

102
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:47,286
- So what --
- what is he wearing?

103
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:51,056
- Yeah.
- A long jacket, a top hat,

104
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:53,825
definitely older style
clothing.

105
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,727
Does he ever acknowledge
anyone else

106
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,529
or look at anyone
or say anything?

107
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:59,998
Just comes straight down,
kind of lands,

108
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,702
and then he's gone.

109
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:06,204
We always say the music
must have tracked him down --
right.

110
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:08,073
...Because that seems to be
when we see him.

111
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:09,508
I have not seen him.

112
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,611
I hear things and doors opening
and closing and walking around,

113
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:14,746
but never actually
physically see anybody

114
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:16,048
except when there's music.

115
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,016
- Sounds like we need a band.
- Yeah, yeah, for sure.

116
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:19,451
- That would be awesome.
- Some sort of music.

117
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:22,788
Love the music, for sure.
The lights tend to go nuts.

118
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:27,192
We get open
and closing doors.

119
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:29,294
And rumor has it in '55

120
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:32,097
when we had the large flood
that took out everything,

121
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:34,199
including some cemeteries,

122
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:35,300
this was used
as a makeshift morgue.

123
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:41,206
so besides the lights
being manipulated with

124
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:44,109
and the apparition seen,
what other --

125
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:46,578
- when you come in here --
- yeah.

126
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,215
...In this area here I've had
some objects flown at me,

127
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:52,684
the jukebox would go on,
I'd shut it off, I'd get my ice,

128
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:56,688
I'd go upstairs, I'd come back,
the jukebox would be on.

129
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,657
Now you said you had something
thrown in here?

130
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:00,525
I was working on
a Saturday night.

131
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:03,261
They threw this
sugar caddy at me

132
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,996
and all the sugar packets
went everywhere.

133
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:07,065
- Weird.
- Weird.

134
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:09,735
That same week, a couple
that came with a small child,

135
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:12,104
I guess she was, like,
maybe 4---

136
00:06:12,106 --> 00:06:14,005
...And she started
getting fussy, wanted to leave,

137
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:15,640
got upset,
her parents asked her why,

138
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,342
she said, "that little girl
is bothering me,"

139
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:18,643
pointing to the table
next to them.

140
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:19,845
There was nobody there.

141
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:21,747
And they actually
didn't eat dinner, they left.

142
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:23,682
They saw the ghost
of a child.

143
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:25,817
- Yeah.
- Okay.

144
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,052
Good to know.

145
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:29,888
So what's the frequency
you'd say of activity?

146
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,223
Like, how often is it happening?

147
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,457
Several times a week.

148
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:34,259
- Okay, so regular, for sure.
- Yeah, it's regular.

149
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:35,594
- Okay.
- Yeah.

150
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:36,795
Do you want to take us
anywhere else in the building?

151
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:37,963
I would love to take you
upstairs --
okay.

152
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:40,665
...And then the attic.

153
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:49,574
okay.

154
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,443
So I come in at 3:00
every day.

155
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:53,812
I lock this door behind me
and check my book

156
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:56,214
because reservations
are generally here.

157
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:59,818
And a gentleman likes to talk
to me from right here.

158
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,486
- Okay.
- What do you mean?

159
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:04,222
"hey," I look up, I'm, "hello?"

160
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:06,425
the first couple of times
I thought somebody was here,

161
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:08,026
there was nobody here.

162
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,327
Strange.

163
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:12,164
I've gone up, I've tried,
no other communication.

164
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,899
- Definitely male?
- Definitely male.

165
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:15,267
Did it sound like
an older gentleman?

166
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:18,737
Definitely an older,
very curt.

167
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:20,806
We've had multiple stories
about who it could be,

168
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:23,308
one of them is
this gentleman sam,

169
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,144
so we all greet him
generally as sam.

170
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,180
Does he respond to sam?

171
00:07:28,182 --> 00:07:29,247
With lights.

172
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:30,549
So he'll turn on the lights
and stuff.

173
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:33,585
- He will flicker lights.
- Okay.

174
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:36,555
Stacy gets more agitated
with every story that she tells.

175
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:38,190
So obviously something
in this building

176
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:40,625
is really affecting her.

177
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:45,063
And this here is
the top floor attic.

178
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:46,331
What I love about this
is you can see, like,

179
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,433
the original structure
so much.

180
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:52,070
It's a little glimpse
into this building's past.

181
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:53,238
And how's the activity here?

182
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,540
There has been
some apparitions,

183
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:58,677
lot of shadowy figures
that we're seeing up here.

184
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,045
I can tell you,
coming up here,

185
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:02,047
it's not something
I like to do by myself.

186
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:04,082
So, at all.

187
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:05,183
Okay.

188
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:09,187
So this chair over here
with a little bunny.

189
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,056
- Yeah.
- As you go through the building,

190
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:12,524
you're gonna see, like,
chairs that'll have

191
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:14,626
some stuffed animals,
some lollipop, stuff like that.

192
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:15,894
- Okay.
- Okay.

193
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:17,095
Those are generally customers
or other employees

194
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,431
that have, like,
left them for the kids.

195
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:21,500
This is an apparition of a child
in this space?

196
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:22,901
- Yeah.
- Okay.

197
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:24,936
And if you've touch
the stuffed animals,

198
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:27,272
a lot of times
you'll get some activity.

199
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:28,773
What kind of
activity happens?

200
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:31,843
Like, they can feel
hot and cold spots.
Okay.

201
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,913
They've caught other
shadowy figures.

202
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:37,549
Multiple people
have seen them.

203
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:40,118
Good to know.
All right, let's get set up.
Okay, let's go.

204
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,253
- Thank you, guys.
- Thank you. Appreciate it.

205
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:44,856
- You're welcome.
- Well, good luck.

206
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,525
Mike and stacy both
really want to find out

207
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,960
who's here and what's here
and why they're here.

208
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:51,363
They've had a lot
of major crazy activity.

209
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,231
Things are being thrown.
They heard voices.

210
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:54,566
They see apparitions.

211
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:56,201
Hopefully we're gonna be able
to get a lot of activity

212
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:57,736
'cause that's exactly
what we're here to do.

213
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:59,070
We're here to find out
who they are,

214
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:00,438
communicate with them

215
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,541
because something is going on
and we got to figure it out.

216
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:08,146
With mike and his
employees gone for the night,

217
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,382
we are ready to start
our investigation.

218
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:11,550
Here we go.

219
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:13,985
Adam and I are headed
downstairs to the lounge

220
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:16,955
where stacy seems to experience
the most activity.

221
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:26,898
let's see if we can play
with that sugar thing

222
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,834
and see if we can get it
to fall or...

223
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:32,304
Absolutely.

224
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:36,207
This thing.

225
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:38,643
What if it just
wasn't all the way up?

226
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:40,312
If that fell, though,
that's gonna hit all those.

227
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:45,617
I know. But I have seen mice
and rats in restaurants

228
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:48,887
knock entire glasses
and stuff off shelves.

229
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:51,189
Yeah, but what
about the other...

230
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:57,028
My god.

231
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,763
That's going off. Everything is
literally going crazy in here.

232
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,799
What the ****
is happening right here?

233
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:02,667
So bodies were found.

234
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:05,170
There's an unidentified body
found over here.

235
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:07,839
Although the flood
took about 87 lives,

236
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,908
there were a lot of people
from this cemetery

237
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,142
that were disturbed.

238
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:20,585
This former bank
turned restaurant

239
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:22,454
is serving up a ton of activity.

240
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:23,989
Something is here all right

241
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:27,258
and it has the employees
and patrons running scared.

242
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,830
I have seen mice
and rats in restaurants

243
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:35,133
knock entire glasses
and stuff off shelves.

244
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,901
Yeah.

245
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:42,941
My god.

246
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:44,376
That's going off. Everything is
literally going crazy in here.

247
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:47,212
What the ****
is happening right here?

248
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:48,747
Wait, how did that happen?

249
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:51,249
The jukebox would go on.
I'd shut it off. I'd get my ice.

250
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,318
I'd go upstairs. I'd come back.
The jukebox would be on.

251
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,886
I don't know.
That's going off.

252
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:58,423
That's going off.
That turned on by itself.

253
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:00,992
This made a noise.
Like, it came on.

254
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:05,430
That's still going off.
Okay. We get it. I'm sorry.

255
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:09,534
All right. So whoever you are,
message received.

256
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:12,070
Can you tell us
what your name is?

257
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:19,044
did I upset you?

258
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:21,579
Are you very protective
of this space?

259
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:30,021
did you work here
when it was a restaurant

260
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:33,458
or were you a patron here?

261
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,693
So weird.

262
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:36,695
All right,
let's listen to this.

263
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,160
Strange.

264
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:13,231
So what that tells me is someone
attached to the building --
yep.

265
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,365
...Cares about the building.

266
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:17,168
Yeah, does not like
even insinuating

267
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,837
something bad
about this place,

268
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,740
whether it's a restaurant
or a bank or whatever it is.

269
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:23,341
And this is what they live
with every day?

270
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:24,509
Like, this is
what they're working in?

271
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:25,477
That happens?

272
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:27,345
And if people are
noticing activity

273
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:29,781
and they're sitting
at a crowded bar --

274
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:31,716
- I know. That's crazy.
- That's insane.

275
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:34,185
And we're here quiet
and look what happens.

276
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:35,954
All right, well let's
go get our stuff together

277
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:37,355
and then we'll figure out
what we're gonna do next.

278
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:39,758
- Okay.
- Ay-yi-yi.

279
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,259
If that happened
while I was here by myself,

280
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,896
I might pee my pants.

281
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:46,297
So the activity
we got tonight

282
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:48,333
tells us that somebody's
familiar with the building.

283
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:50,635
Somebody is very passionate
about the space,

284
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:52,403
whether it's
a restaurant or bank.

285
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:56,608
But at this point, we're still
uncertain about who it is.

286
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,176
One of the big things
that happened here

287
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:00,044
was that there was
a giant flood

288
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:02,781
that actually brought coffins
up out of the ground

289
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,415
and washed them down the river

290
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:08,753
and apparently, this building
was used to store those caskets.

291
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:11,523
Maybe that'll have something
to do with the haunting here.

292
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:13,224
We asked the local historian
to meet us

293
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:14,759
at the derby public library

294
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:16,895
to tell us more about
the catastrophic flood.

295
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:18,496
We don't have much
to go on yet.

296
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:21,099
But a tragic event that littered
the town with dead bodies

297
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:22,300
is a good place to start.

298
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,535
- Hi.
- Hi, folks.

299
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:25,236
- Are you dan?
- I'm dan. Pleasure to meet you.

300
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:26,805
- I'm amy. Good to meet you.
- Adam. Nice to meet you.

301
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:30,675
I'm dan.
Pleasure to meet you, adam.

302
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:32,577
Now we were really focusing
on the flood

303
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:35,113
because the building that
we're investigating right now,

304
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:39,551
there's this idea that maybe
at one point some of the bodies

305
00:13:39,553 --> 00:13:41,886
that had washed away
from the flood

306
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:45,990
ended up kind of in a makeshift
morgue in the building.

307
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:49,127
Okay, so bodies were found.

308
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:51,696
There's an unidentified body
found over here.

309
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:53,832
It's an embalmed body
found in the river

310
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:56,968
and it's likely that
these bodies were disturbed

311
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,838
from union cemetery,
which is upstream.

312
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,506
Right here, we have
a newspaper clipping

313
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:04,709
which says is the scene
at union cemetery.

314
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:06,110
That's crazy.

315
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:10,348
And it disturbed coffins
and it disinterred many people.

316
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,084
Although the flood
took about 87 lives,

317
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:15,019
there were a lot of people
from this cemetery

318
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,455
that were
unfortunately disturbed.

319
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:23,394
In 1955, anything
that is going to be told

320
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,697
from one person to another,
typically,

321
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:26,965
you would also find the evidence

322
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:28,533
you know,
in the form of newspapers.

323
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:29,868
- Right.
- Right.

324
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,705
Because the newspapers
report exactly what happened.

325
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,373
Is there any evidence
in all of this

326
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,977
that the old birmingham bank
was a morgue at any point?

327
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:41,346
I have not been able to find
any evidence

328
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:44,949
to substantiate that claim.

329
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:47,352
Because I'm basing
my research on fact,

330
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:51,589
I can't prove something happened
that I don't find proof before.

331
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,191
Right. No, that's fine.

332
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:55,193
I mean, there may be
other things, too, you know,

333
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:57,562
during the time it was a bank.

334
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,497
So I was hoping
to kind of dig in some more

335
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:01,733
and see if I could find
some more information on it.

336
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,368
Dan, thank you so much
for all of your help.

337
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,535
- The pleasure's mine.
- It's super helpful.

338
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:06,037
Thank you. Thank you.
Nice to see you.

339
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,505
- Thank you so much, guys.
- All right.

340
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:10,375
There's so many cases where
we have to sift through, like,

341
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:13,444
lore and hearsay
versus actual fact

342
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:15,747
and at the end of the day
we want to do a service

343
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,082
to not only the people
we're helping at the restaurant

344
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,984
but to the ghosts
of the restaurant.

345
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:22,654
We want to make sure we're
telling their story accurately

346
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:25,323
and if they weren't the ghosts
of past flood victims,

347
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:26,557
who were they?

348
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:35,033
when someone comes to us
and they say that activity

349
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:37,535
happens at a certain time
or under certain conditions,

350
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:39,938
we always try to replicate
those conditions.

351
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,441
In this case, stacy told us
that activity really ramped up

352
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,509
when there were bands playing.

353
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:47,011
So right now we have
a band set up here

354
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:49,180
and we're gonna use them
as a trigger object.

355
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:51,849
No one else is here
in the restaurant.

356
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:53,184
So we're gonna investigate

357
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:55,987
while they're playing
and record them with the sls

358
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:57,722
to see if anything appears.

359
00:15:57,724 --> 00:15:59,824
I can say we've never
done this before.

360
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,793
So I'm hoping it works.

361
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:54,545
I got cold chills in here

362
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:55,947
and I feel scared.

363
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:58,316
So I'm empathing somebody
that's been in here

364
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:02,020
that's, like, freaking out.

365
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:08,659
We've been told
the apparition

366
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:10,161
that haunts this former bank

367
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:12,897
is drawn out
when live music is played.

368
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:15,733
We're conducting an experiment
we've never tried before

369
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:19,203
using a band as our trigger
object to help lore it out.

370
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:32,650
- gone.
- Weird.

371
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:37,188
- Gone when the music stopped.
- When the music stopped, yep.

372
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,857
We caught an anomaly
on the sls camera

373
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:42,794
and it's just standing
in the same vicinity

374
00:17:42,796 --> 00:17:45,496
of where they see the apparition
of this gentleman

375
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:46,664
in a hat and a coat.

376
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:49,100
We have a gentleman
that comes down the steps

377
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:50,334
that you guys came down,

378
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,703
lands on the landing down there
and then he's gone.

379
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:53,971
There's nothing.

380
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:56,674
Who was this person?
Was he involved here?

381
00:17:56,676 --> 00:18:00,111
Was he someone who died
in the flood? I don't know.

382
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:02,613
So we're gonna have to keep
investigating, digging deeper,

383
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:04,916
and trying to figure out who
exactly here is in the space.

384
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:11,089
now that we lured it out,
we've released the band

385
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:13,191
so that we can try to
communicate with the spirit

386
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:17,795
using another trigger object,
one original to the bank.

387
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:19,097
We're setting up one of
the original bank notes

388
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:22,200
from the bank that was here
to a proximity sensor

389
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:26,804
so that if anything touches it,
this little alarm will go off.

390
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:28,873
We also set up the flux,

391
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,909
the device that can sense
if something is near it

392
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:34,545
and it also senses
temperature fluctuations.

393
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:43,521
That's weird.
It shouldn't have gone off.

394
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:46,591
The flux is going off.

395
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:48,392
Temperature.

396
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:50,962
Is there someone here?

397
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:53,731
Can you tell us your name?

398
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:56,968
There is a person

399
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:01,005
that interacts
and they call him sam.

400
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:02,840
Is that you?

401
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:13,484
what was your role
in this building?

402
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:17,555
Do you know any stories
about this bank?

403
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:23,594
do you recognize

404
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:26,130
what's on the table,

405
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:29,834
in the frame right here?

406
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,436
You can touch it
and the alarm will go off,

407
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:35,973
but it won't hurt you
and you're not in trouble.

408
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:02,433
what was that,
right there?

409
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,542
- I do.
- I do.

410
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,111
Clearly.

411
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:15,846
Intelligent, male.

412
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:17,081
And he knows
what a bank note is.

413
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,282
And he knows
what a bank note is.

414
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:22,587
So either he's been here
long enough to know

415
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:24,655
that that's a bank note
and he's seen it

416
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:26,924
or he's from the time period
and there it is.

417
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:30,094
Yeah.
I mean, he knows
that it's based on that.

418
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:32,663
We've got an evp that said,
"I do."

419
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,165
like, it knew
what the bank note was.

420
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:36,534
But other than that,
it was very quiet.

421
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:39,470
Whoever this person
is does not want to talk to us.

422
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:41,872
We've experienced
a lot of paranormal activity,

423
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:44,242
but we've got nothing
to confirm

424
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:45,142
who we are speaking with.

425
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,154
today we decided to use
chip to our advantage.

426
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:59,624
And so, he came in not knowing
anything about the building,

427
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:01,425
where we were,
the history of it, nothing.

428
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,361
We want to know
who does he pick up on

429
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:06,364
and whatever he picks up on,
how much of that correlates

430
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:08,499
with the activity
that we've been having.

431
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,151
old man,

432
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:28,686
the impression is,
"I'm the boss."-

433
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:36,394
I hear a very snide voice
in my head say,

434
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:40,598
"I've got the keys.
I'm the boss. Do what I say."

435
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,200
"do what I say."

436
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:46,304
you've got some illegal activity
that happened in this building.

437
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:53,911
- money changing hands.
- Okay.

438
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,651
The spirit that
roams the halls

439
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,386
of the twisted vine restaurant

440
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:04,655
refuses to speak
with adam and me,

441
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:07,258
so we're bringing in psychic
medium chip coffey

442
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,759
to help level the playing field

443
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:11,729
and move our investigation
forward.

444
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:15,333
The thing he said to me is,
"I have the keys."

445
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:16,634
okay.

446
00:22:16,636 --> 00:22:20,137
"I have the keys."

447
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:22,073
interesting stuff
in this building.

448
00:22:22,075 --> 00:22:24,275
Yeah.

449
00:22:24,277 --> 00:22:27,878
Like off the wall interesting
stuff in this building.

450
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,846
Where are the other levels at?

451
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:29,980
How do you get
to the other levels?

452
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:31,582
Downstairs is this way.

453
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:49,934
this place makes me woozy,

454
00:22:49,936 --> 00:22:53,170
like physically...

455
00:22:55,308 --> 00:22:57,274
it's like I'm drunk.

456
00:22:59,846 --> 00:23:02,913
They have stuff
that moves down here.

457
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:06,450
It's definitely
an active spot down here.

458
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:09,587
You've got some illegal activity
that happened in this building.

459
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,761
money changing hands.

460
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:18,062
Okay.

461
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:22,199
Whoever is here, whatever
is here is very secretive.

462
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:24,402
It's got stages of stuff
is what I'm feeling.

463
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:26,237
And it's confusing because
there's a lot of stuff

464
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:27,571
that's going on in my head.

465
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,507
The most prominent
that I've gotten so far

466
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:31,675
is the grumpy old man
that feels like he is, like,

467
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:33,844
in charge of stuff

468
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:37,681
and, you know, "don't mess
with me. I'm in charge."

469
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:43,487
And totally random
and out there, a drowning.

470
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:46,323
I wouldn't be surprised
if it's a child.

471
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:48,058
A little girl.

472
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,393
- Okay.
- Okay.

473
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:50,628
Anything else you want
to ask me about down here?

474
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,695
Do you mind if we take
just a walk through?

475
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:52,863
Yeah, just walk around the bar.

476
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:55,166
- Not a problem.
- Yeah, just kind of...

477
00:23:55,168 --> 00:23:58,402
Okay.

478
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:00,938
And I just got pushed
in the back.

479
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:13,117
I got cold chills in here.

480
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,618
I don't pick up
anything specific,

481
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,888
but I pickup that people
get weirded out in this space --
okay.

482
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,723
...By things either moving

483
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:21,959
or touching
or something like that.

484
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:24,361
And I feel scared.

485
00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:26,730
Some empathing,
somebody that's been in here

486
00:24:26,732 --> 00:24:29,133
that's, like, freaking out.

487
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,572
So as chip walked through
the building,

488
00:24:34,574 --> 00:24:36,207
he picked up on a little girl.

489
00:24:36,209 --> 00:24:38,442
He also picked up
on an older male,

490
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:40,711
who seemed very protective
of the space,

491
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:42,847
who seemed very secretive.

492
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:45,249
It's interesting that chip
brought up money changing hands

493
00:24:45,251 --> 00:24:47,918
because this was a bank
and so, that makes sense.

494
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,321
But he also said
that he got kind of a vibe

495
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:52,056
of something
not really on the level,

496
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:53,257
something shady going on.

497
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:55,659
And so, armed
with that information,

498
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:57,895
we'll go into
the investigation tonight

499
00:24:57,897 --> 00:24:59,396
and start bringing
that up to see

500
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:01,165
if it triggers
any more activity.

501
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:07,872
- okay, I need to show you this.
- Okay.

502
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:11,175
I've never seen anything
like it on this dvr.
Really?

503
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:13,878
So this is the camera that's up
in the attic, right?

504
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,312
- Right.
- Nobody's here in this space.

505
00:25:15,314 --> 00:25:17,715
It's like 4:00
in the morning.

506
00:25:17,717 --> 00:25:19,817
Now when you watch it,
see how there's movement here?

507
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:21,819
- Yeah.
- Okay. Watch right here.

508
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:23,821
Okay.

509
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:25,155
- See that?
- Yeah.

510
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:28,125
Okay. What happens to the dvr
when that shows up?

511
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:29,527
It just stops.

512
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:33,931
It literally stops our entire
system for about 25 seconds.
Wow.

513
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:35,599
It just is, like, poof!

514
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:38,369
That's so strange.

515
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:39,570
I've never seen
anything like that.

516
00:25:39,572 --> 00:25:41,872
I've never been to a place
where things

517
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:43,807
just constantly
get messed with.

518
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:45,042
Like, I mean, obviously,

519
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,610
that's been a report of ours
for a long time.

520
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:47,978
We've seen it
on a smaller scale,

521
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,247
but this place is like...

522
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:51,582
Like, I've just never seen
anything like it.

523
00:25:51,584 --> 00:25:54,818
The fact that the dvr
just stops...

524
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,254
I don't even know.

525
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:04,061
okay.

526
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:08,332
Well, I just did a search on,
like, death, tragedy.

527
00:26:08,334 --> 00:26:11,635
Derby, connecticut,
November 18, 1913.

528
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:12,803
Samuel. H. Lessey,

529
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:15,039
cashier of the birmingham
national bank here,

530
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:18,375
committed suicide in a vault
in oak cliff cemetery

531
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:19,877
on the outskirts of the city.

532
00:26:19,879 --> 00:26:22,346
We all greet him
generally as sam.

533
00:26:22,348 --> 00:26:26,183
My god.

534
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:28,986
Some time today, his body
lying in a coffin box

535
00:26:28,988 --> 00:26:30,921
was found in a vault
shortly after midnight

536
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:33,824
by chief of police,
odell and officer kennedy.

537
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:35,359
A bullet hole was in his temple

538
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:38,128
and one of his hands
clutched a revolver.

539
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,196
He put himself in a coffin.

540
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:41,498
He literally killed himself
in a coffin.

541
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:45,369
- In a vault.
- In a vault. That's crazy.

542
00:26:45,371 --> 00:26:47,738
Deceased highly respected
in derby.

543
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:51,809
Lessey had been connected
with the bank 25 years.

544
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:54,411
He was married,
had two children.

545
00:26:54,413 --> 00:26:55,980
Wow!

546
00:26:55,982 --> 00:26:58,616
Two worthless checks had
recently been deposited

547
00:26:58,618 --> 00:26:59,984
at the bank.

548
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:04,254
So this criminal, he received
a check for $15 and one for $10,

549
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:06,156
and he added zeros to them.

550
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:09,593
So he basically took $2,500

551
00:27:09,595 --> 00:27:12,329
under mr. Lessey's watch.

552
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:13,797
It was a scandal.

553
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,767
You've got some illegal activity
that happened in this building.

554
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:22,473
money changing hands.

555
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:23,641
So is that why
he killed himself?

556
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:25,743
Because he thought
it was his fault.

557
00:27:25,745 --> 00:27:28,145
Mr. Lessey was made cashier
of the bank.

558
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:30,648
He worried a great deal
over the matters

559
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:33,584
which had come to him
with the new position.

560
00:27:33,586 --> 00:27:36,954
Wow! It could be the sam
who goes downstairs,

561
00:27:36,956 --> 00:27:38,555
because what if the --
- I know.

562
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:39,857
- It's like the way he's dressed.
- What if the --

563
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:40,858
- he's going to the vault.
- Yeah, the way he's dressed.

564
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,126
- He's going to the vault.
- Yes.

565
00:27:42,128 --> 00:27:43,460
- What is he wearing?
- Yeah.

566
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:47,097
Like a long jacket,
a top hat.

567
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:50,034
Definitely
older style clothing.

568
00:27:50,036 --> 00:27:53,404
- I know.
- Girl, chills, these chills.

569
00:27:53,406 --> 00:27:55,973
We did get a name tonight
from a newspaper article

570
00:27:55,975 --> 00:27:58,609
that I found just before
we started to investigate,

571
00:27:58,611 --> 00:28:00,010
and the name happened to be sam.

572
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:03,280
We thought we'd just go right
for that and see if bringing up

573
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:05,282
that gentleman
and his job at the bank

574
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:07,785
and what happened would give us
any sort of response.

575
00:28:07,787 --> 00:28:08,919
So let's go to the attic.

576
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:10,654
All right, let's try it.
You know what?

577
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:13,957
We'll bring the bank note
and use the proximity sensor.

578
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:15,492
The third floor in the attic
is one of the most

579
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:17,661
original spaces in the building

580
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:21,398
because it has virtually been
untouched since it was a bank.

581
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,933
It's a space
that we want to get into.

582
00:28:22,935 --> 00:28:25,936
We want to investigate and we
want to try to connect with sam

583
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:28,539
because sam is an original
person to the building.

584
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:30,107
He was connected to this
building from the day

585
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:31,709
it was built.

586
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:40,150
We keep hearing stories
about this gentleman

587
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:41,719
named samuel lessey.

588
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:45,022
Is he still here?

589
00:28:45,024 --> 00:28:48,425
The temperature changed.

590
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:51,095
He worked here
for quite a long time.

591
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,502
I hate to bring it up. I know
it's not a pleasant topic,

592
00:28:58,504 --> 00:29:01,939
but it's just so hard
to believe

593
00:29:01,941 --> 00:29:04,441
and your family
moved right after.

594
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:10,047
Your wife took the kids
and went to new york

595
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:12,082
and then after that...

596
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:15,419
it's going off.

597
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:19,089
Okay. After that,
your daughter...

598
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,257
- Shah.

599
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,126
again.

600
00:29:22,128 --> 00:29:24,361
Temperature.

601
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:28,799
Your daughter grew up
and became a teacher.

602
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:31,468
I don't believe
she ever married or had kids.

603
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,306
it's really going off.

604
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,247
he was just up there
looking down on you.
He was?

605
00:29:43,249 --> 00:29:45,015
Yep.

606
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:47,384
This is going off.
That's going off.

607
00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:48,652
This is going off.

608
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:53,257
Do you want us to get the hell
out of your building?

609
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,164
The old cashier at this
former bank,

610
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:02,099
sam lessey,
may have killed himself

611
00:30:02,101 --> 00:30:04,368
because of some shady
business deals.

612
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:07,538
We think his spirit could be
attached to this restaurant.

613
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,906
It's really going off.

614
00:30:16,582 --> 00:30:20,250
so it seems we hit
some sort of nerve.

615
00:30:20,252 --> 00:30:21,885
Samuel, mr. Lessey,

616
00:30:21,887 --> 00:30:23,720
I'm gonna stop talking
about this for now. Okay?

617
00:30:23,722 --> 00:30:26,490
So can you leave that alone
and I'll stop talking about it.

618
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:29,793
Okay? Okay,
I turned off the recorder.

619
00:30:36,402 --> 00:30:37,801
okay, we're back. All right.

620
00:30:37,803 --> 00:30:41,004
It's back to normal.
I'm gonna listen to this.

621
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:23,213
I mean, it really goes in line
with the electronics.

622
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:28,118
And it was when we were talking
about sam and his family,

623
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,588
what happened to him,
what happened to her, basically.
Yeah.

624
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:34,024
It's just so strange.
Like every time

625
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:36,560
we bring up, like, the building
and we bring up him, like,

626
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:39,763
something starts getting messed
with electronically.

627
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:42,032
So why is he choosing
to communicate that way

628
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:44,401
and what can we do

629
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:49,339
to encourage him to just
use words and speak?

630
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:50,874
This might be a case
where it comes down to chip

631
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:53,510
because chip's the only one,
like, if he picks up on this guy

632
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:55,779
and can actually talk to him
and communicate with him...

633
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:57,447
Yeah.

634
00:31:57,449 --> 00:32:00,417
All right, so let's
pack this up.

635
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:03,687
If he's here, if sam is here,
chip is gonna pick up on him.-

636
00:32:18,837 --> 00:32:21,638
this guy likes to mess
with equipment

637
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,642
so I think the idea here is that
we need to blanket this place

638
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:28,512
with anything that can be
manipulated, rem pods, k2s --
yep.

639
00:32:28,514 --> 00:32:31,248
- Anything electronic.
- The flux, all of it.

640
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,450
This entity has been
manipulating our equipment.

641
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:37,187
We've got so much activity
in terms of equipment

642
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:39,022
going off and interaction.

643
00:32:39,024 --> 00:32:41,191
And I mean,
the space is haunted

644
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:43,026
and we're hoping
that chip can connect

645
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:44,728
with whoever is doing this

646
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:48,832
and tell us who it is
or at least give the message

647
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:51,234
and figure out why this person
is in this space.

648
00:32:51,236 --> 00:32:52,970
Has there been activity
that's been malicious

649
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:54,671
or threatening
in this building?

650
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:57,307
- No, it's just very...
- Authoritative.

651
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:58,675
It is. It's very, like,

652
00:32:58,677 --> 00:33:00,477
the second that you can do
something wrong

653
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:03,080
or, like,
I said something potentially bad

654
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:06,149
about the building downstairs
and everything lit up.
Yeah.

655
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,485
He's just very protective
of the building.

656
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:11,088
He's very ocd and anal retentive
and wants things done.

657
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,090
And even if the staff that works
in the restaurant here

658
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:15,258
is doing something
and they're making an oops ---

659
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:18,061
You know, that may be when
he's like, "hey, hey, hey."

660
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:22,532
he was just up there
looking down on you.

661
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:24,534
- He was?
- Yep.

662
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:27,704
So he's watching already.

663
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:28,905
He knows.

664
00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:32,175
- Yeah, he does know.
- For sure.

665
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:33,844
On the stairs, on the stairs.

666
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:35,345
- I saw a shadow.
- I did, too.

667
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:37,714
- What? You saw it?
- Yeah. Right there.

668
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:39,049
Yes.

669
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:41,385
It was as tall as that crook
corner where it comes in.

670
00:33:41,387 --> 00:33:43,420
- That's what they see.
- And it was, like, boop,

671
00:33:43,422 --> 00:33:45,222
and it would
just went right down the stairs.

672
00:33:45,224 --> 00:33:47,891
So does that mean you want to
talk to us now or are you ready?

673
00:33:47,893 --> 00:33:50,394
Mr. Lessey? Well, this is
your time to shine.

674
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:55,198
This is your time
to get it all out.

675
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,366
Did you see that?

676
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:57,701
I did.

677
00:33:57,703 --> 00:34:00,137
That went off.
This went off at the same time.-

678
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:01,638
Sam's who you're
looking at here.

679
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,341
Just let me tell you
that's what I feel.

680
00:34:04,343 --> 00:34:08,245
So sam, mr. Lessey,

681
00:34:08,247 --> 00:34:10,881
did you actually

682
00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:12,849
kill yourself?

683
00:34:18,624 --> 00:34:20,891
this is going off.
That's going off.

684
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,959
This is going off.

685
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:24,227
My.

686
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,200
did you commit suicide?

687
00:34:30,202 --> 00:34:33,437
- It's going off.
- That is pinging loudly.

688
00:34:33,439 --> 00:34:35,639
He's dodging.

689
00:34:35,641 --> 00:34:39,910
That's...

690
00:34:44,883 --> 00:34:48,618
We're in derby,
connecticut and we're not alone.

691
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,320
- Did you see that?
- I did.

692
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:53,223
Going off. That went off.
This went off at the same time.-

693
00:34:53,225 --> 00:34:55,692
Something has attached
itself to this old building

694
00:34:55,694 --> 00:34:57,861
and hopefully
chip can connect with the spirit

695
00:34:57,863 --> 00:35:00,730
so we can find out
what it wants.

696
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:08,405
mr. Lessey, I know you love
lighting up all this stuff,

697
00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:10,340
but if you talk in this
as close as you can,

698
00:35:10,342 --> 00:35:11,508
as loudly as you can,

699
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:14,578
and just answer
these questions for us.

700
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,047
Did you commit suicide?

701
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:22,185
if you did that, why?

702
00:35:22,187 --> 00:35:25,322
That's going off.

703
00:35:25,324 --> 00:35:27,591
Yep.

704
00:35:27,593 --> 00:35:29,659
That's...

705
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:32,229
- It's acknowledgement.
- It is acknowledgement.

706
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:37,767
It's like he still
will not tell us.

707
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:39,736
Frustrating.
He doesn't want
to talk about it.

708
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:41,571
- I know. I feel terrible. Okay.
- Play it.

709
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:48,845
Sam, light that up
all the way.

710
00:35:57,556 --> 00:36:01,825
I've never been anywhere
so devoid of evp's.

711
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:02,959
He's dodging.

712
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:04,828
This is going off.

713
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:08,165
It's the first time
that's gone off the entire time.

714
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:10,767
But he's just setting off
everything.
I know.

715
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:13,336
Can we ask him one thing?

716
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,639
Do you want
to just be left alone?

717
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:18,074
Yeah, let's just ask him that.

718
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:24,814
sir, do you want us
to just leave you alone?

719
00:36:30,956 --> 00:36:32,155
- it's going off.
- That is going off.

720
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:34,157
Do you want people
to just stop bothering you?

721
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:37,794
- Yeah, it's going off.
- That is pinging loudly.

722
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:41,064
Wow. That's crazy.

723
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:42,632
He just wants us
to leave him alone.

724
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:45,635
Do you want us to get the hell
out of your building?

725
00:36:46,939 --> 00:36:50,607
that's a yes. We've got it.

726
00:36:50,609 --> 00:36:51,908
I mean, I think
we have answers for them.

727
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,043
I think they're
gonna be thrilled.

728
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:54,544
It's definitely
not what they expected.

729
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,613
I think at the end of the day
you have a man

730
00:36:56,615 --> 00:37:02,519
who chose his position here
within this building over life.

731
00:37:02,521 --> 00:37:05,088
Like, he had a family,
he had everything,

732
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:09,292
and the second that his place
in this building

733
00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:12,395
that he worked for
for so long was jeopardized,

734
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:14,798
he would rather have
just killed himself.

735
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,299
Yes.

736
00:37:16,301 --> 00:37:22,038
And that's what he did and so
he's just here continuing on.

737
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,540
This is a really
interesting case for us

738
00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:25,342
because it's one of those cases

739
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:27,611
where we had a ton of activity
from start to finish.

740
00:37:27,613 --> 00:37:29,212
All of our equipment
was being manipulated

741
00:37:29,214 --> 00:37:30,714
and that is very, very rare.

742
00:37:30,716 --> 00:37:32,749
Also, what's rare
is getting very little

743
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:35,652
evps but sam was able
to communicate with us

744
00:37:35,654 --> 00:37:36,920
that yes, it was him.

745
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:39,623
Yes, these things happened
to him in the past and no,

746
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:40,991
he doesn't want to talk
about it anymore.

747
00:37:40,993 --> 00:37:42,125
He just wants to do his thing,

748
00:37:42,127 --> 00:37:43,560
make sure this business
is running smoothly

749
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:46,029
and live out
the rest of eternity,

750
00:37:46,031 --> 00:37:47,697
I guess in a space
he really loved.

751
00:37:55,007 --> 00:37:56,806
- hi.
- Hi, guys.

752
00:37:56,808 --> 00:37:58,842
How are you? Good morning.
Have a seat.
We're good.

753
00:37:58,844 --> 00:38:02,445
It's been a really exciting
few days.

754
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:05,882
So just to kind of get into it,
we'll just say right off the bat

755
00:38:05,884 --> 00:38:08,518
that you have
a very haunted restaurant.

756
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,719
Wow.

757
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:11,755
Yeah, so we can definitely
confirm that for you.

758
00:38:11,757 --> 00:38:13,189
That's crazy.

759
00:38:13,191 --> 00:38:17,560
One of the most active cases we
have done in a really long time.

760
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:18,895
Wow.

761
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:20,330
The first night,
we went downstairs,

762
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:22,599
we were in the basement
and we were investigating

763
00:38:22,601 --> 00:38:25,402
the claim of the sugar bowl
flying and things,

764
00:38:25,404 --> 00:38:27,237
and so, we were
putting it up there.

765
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:30,273
And I've said, I investigated
a restaurant once

766
00:38:30,275 --> 00:38:33,743
and what they didn't realize
was that they had rodents.

767
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:38,048
And then right at that moment,
the jukebox turned on,

768
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:40,717
all of our equipment
went off all at once --
wow.

769
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:43,053
...Everything,
which is really impossible.

770
00:38:43,055 --> 00:38:44,821
- Yeah.
- Then I said, I'm sorry.

771
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:46,389
Again, I'm not saying
that's what's happening here.

772
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:47,590
We're just trying
to figure out,

773
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:49,092
so if you want to tell us
who you really are

774
00:38:49,094 --> 00:38:51,328
and what's happening,
that would be great.

775
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,997
- Right.
- Nothing, just quiet.

776
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:56,099
While the activity
was massive and frequent,

777
00:38:56,101 --> 00:38:57,967
it was just nothing
identifiable.

778
00:38:57,969 --> 00:39:00,737
And so we really had
to kind of think outside the box

779
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:04,274
to figure out
who's haunting the twisted vine.

780
00:39:04,276 --> 00:39:06,376
We had the help
with historical society

781
00:39:06,378 --> 00:39:09,646
and they actually pulled out
newspapers from the time period

782
00:39:09,648 --> 00:39:11,681
and we scoured
every one of them,

783
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:15,452
but there was zero mention
of this place being a morgue.
Okay.

784
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:18,254
It's hearsay, it's legend,
it's folklore.

785
00:39:18,256 --> 00:39:21,458
But in terms of factual
identifiable information,

786
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,094
that wasn't something
that we were able to find.

787
00:39:24,096 --> 00:39:26,529
And that's fine because you want
to get to the root of it

788
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,998
and you want to figure out
who's really haunting the place.
Absolutely.

789
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,835
As we kind of dug
more into this case,

790
00:39:31,837 --> 00:39:34,270
we thought maybe it's someone
associated with the bank.

791
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:35,739
What I'm gonna do
is I'm going

792
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:37,107
to put a newspaper article up

793
00:39:37,109 --> 00:39:39,576
and I want you to read it out
loud for us. Okay?

794
00:39:39,578 --> 00:39:42,912
Okay.

795
00:39:42,914 --> 00:39:45,849
Bank cashier ends life
in cemetery.

796
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:50,286
Samuel h. Lessey of derby
found dead in coffin box.

797
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:55,625
He had been censored Saturday
for carelessness,

798
00:39:55,627 --> 00:39:59,095
which enabled an alleged
forgery of checks.

799
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:00,463
Wow.

800
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:02,198
- Boy.
- Right.

801
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,366
Sam.

802
00:40:03,368 --> 00:40:05,101
- Yeah.
- Wow.

803
00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:06,803
He was here when the bank
was made.

804
00:40:06,805 --> 00:40:10,340
He's part of this bank
becoming a thing --
yeah, part of the process, wow.

805
00:40:10,342 --> 00:40:13,810
...And so he essentially died
for this building.

806
00:40:13,812 --> 00:40:16,312
- Wow.
- Everything was taken from him

807
00:40:16,314 --> 00:40:19,449
when he was accused
of letting this happen.

808
00:40:19,451 --> 00:40:22,218
He would not talk to us.

809
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,521
Like, chip picked up on him
right away when chip came in

810
00:40:24,523 --> 00:40:26,890
and he let him know I have
the keys to this building,

811
00:40:26,892 --> 00:40:28,224
is what he said right away.

812
00:40:28,226 --> 00:40:30,660
Chip also picked up
on your little girl, who's here.

813
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:31,661
He did.

814
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:33,263
We did not get any evidence
of her.

815
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:35,031
But that doesn't mean
she's not here.

816
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:37,167
No.
Do you think
he'll get comfortable

817
00:40:37,169 --> 00:40:38,768
if we treat him properly?

818
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:42,238
I think so.
And I think it would be great,

819
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,607
whenever you guys can, to just
kind of pay your respects.

820
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:45,975
We will.

821
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:48,945
And maybe just have something
here in the restaurant for him

822
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:51,714
so people remember his legacy
and what he went through.

823
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:52,982
New dinner special.

824
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:56,019
Because he wants to be here
and he trusts you guys.

825
00:40:56,021 --> 00:40:57,086
How do you know he trusts us?

826
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,922
The way that he interacts
with you guys.

827
00:40:58,924 --> 00:41:00,223
You say hi,
he says hi to you

828
00:41:00,225 --> 00:41:02,492
sometimes when you in
that gruff hello voice.

829
00:41:02,494 --> 00:41:03,560
Yes.

830
00:41:03,562 --> 00:41:04,994
Like, he doesn't do that
for anyone else.

831
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:07,130
And that's really great so
nothing to be afraid of, though.

832
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:08,631
- No.
- No, definitely not.

833
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:11,301
I can't thank you guys enough
for bringing this to us

834
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:14,270
because it's important
to us, you know?

835
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:15,605
Yeah. Unbelievable.
Thank you.

836
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:17,674
I'm glad we could do that
for you.

837
00:41:17,676 --> 00:41:19,142
What I love about
mike and stacy

838
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:22,745
is that they have a genuine
want to get this right.

839
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:25,748
And so when we came here,
they were pretty desperate

840
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,451
because they were having
activity constantly,

841
00:41:28,453 --> 00:41:31,454
day and night,
but they just wanted to do right

842
00:41:31,456 --> 00:41:32,856
by whoever it was.

843
00:41:32,858 --> 00:41:34,424
They've been here so long
and they've interacted

844
00:41:34,426 --> 00:41:35,859
with him so much already.

845
00:41:35,861 --> 00:41:37,160
He's like family to them.

846
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:39,128
This is one of those cases
where they definitely don't have

847
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,530
anything to worry about,
you know.

848
00:41:40,532 --> 00:41:43,800
This is a man who had
such a deep attachment

849
00:41:43,802 --> 00:41:46,202
to this building that all
he wants is the best for it,

850
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:48,304
and that all he wants
is the best for them.

851
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:51,341
And so if anything, they should
feel safer in this building now

852
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:53,443
knowing that he's here,

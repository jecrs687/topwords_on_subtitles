1
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,776
Free Bobby to ride free!

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,492
Free Bobby to ride free!
Free Bobby to ride free!

3
00:00:09,516 --> 00:00:11,127
Free Bobby to ride free!

4
00:00:11,151 --> 00:00:13,263
- Who's Bobby?
- He's their president.

5
00:00:13,287 --> 00:00:14,364
He's on trial in there for running

6
00:00:14,388 --> 00:00:15,965
a meth lab out of his garage.

7
00:00:15,989 --> 00:00:18,268
Bobby's riding five to seven,
what Bobby's riding.

8
00:00:18,292 --> 00:00:20,136
Back behind your bikes, guys!

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,437
...free! Free Bobby to ride...

10
00:00:21,461 --> 00:00:23,940
It's a free country, Porky!

11
00:00:23,964 --> 00:00:26,142
- Back behind your bikes now.
- We got a right

12
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:28,645
- to be heard!
- Behind your bikes, you do.

13
00:00:28,669 --> 00:00:31,437
Free Bobby to ride free!
Free Bobby to ride free!

14
00:00:32,773 --> 00:00:34,350
Hey! Hey! Hey, what's going on?

15
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:40,657
I'm an uncle. I'm an uncle.

16
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:42,058
Walsh, behind you!

17
00:00:50,023 --> 00:00:51,728
Where is Officer Janko?!

18
00:00:51,753 --> 00:00:53,198
Excuse me, ma'am, we're a little busy.

19
00:00:53,222 --> 00:00:55,479
- Please take a seat.
- I need to speak to her now.

20
00:00:55,504 --> 00:00:57,535
Ma'am, we're gonna have to
ask you to calm down, please.

21
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:00,839
I'm not going to calm down until
you bring me Officer Janko.

22
00:01:00,863 --> 00:01:02,639
She's not here now. Maybe
I can help you with something?

23
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:05,671
Yeah. You could start by explaining

24
00:01:05,672 --> 00:01:07,674
why I got a doctor

25
00:01:07,698 --> 00:01:10,353
badgering me and calling my house

26
00:01:10,377 --> 00:01:12,622
after my car accident last week.

27
00:01:12,646 --> 00:01:14,487
I'm sorry, what does this
have to do with Officer Janko?

28
00:01:14,511 --> 00:01:16,259
I was in a single-car crash.

29
00:01:16,283 --> 00:01:17,727
- Uh-huh.
- She's the only person

30
00:01:17,751 --> 00:01:20,062
that knows about this accident
besides me,

31
00:01:20,086 --> 00:01:21,964
and she filed a damn report.

32
00:01:21,988 --> 00:01:23,644
- Did you go to the hospital?
- No.

33
00:01:23,668 --> 00:01:25,935
- File a claim?
- I didn't even tell my husband,

34
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:27,470
'cause I knew he'd have a fit.

35
00:01:27,494 --> 00:01:29,846
Look, I'm-I'm sure
it's probably a coincidence.

36
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,642
I've read about cops
selling accident reports

37
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:34,577
- like this before.
- I think you might

38
00:01:34,601 --> 00:01:35,912
be getting ahead of yourself.

39
00:01:35,936 --> 00:01:37,547
Here's the information.

40
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:39,182
Dr. Mehta.

41
00:01:39,206 --> 00:01:41,317
Janko must have tipped off the doctor,

42
00:01:41,341 --> 00:01:42,908
who knows who else?

43
00:01:44,511 --> 00:01:45,988
All right.

44
00:01:46,012 --> 00:01:49,625
And you were alone in the store
when the robbers entered?

45
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:51,817
I'm-I'm always the first one in.

46
00:01:53,186 --> 00:01:55,162
I thought the front door was locked

47
00:01:55,186 --> 00:01:57,500
when I opened up the safe
and started taking inventory

48
00:01:57,524 --> 00:02:00,136
of the jewels, but he entered,

49
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,673
pulled the gun, pointed
it right at my face.

50
00:02:03,697 --> 00:02:06,742
And did he push you or hit you?

51
00:02:06,766 --> 00:02:09,715
No. He just said...

52
00:02:10,103 --> 00:02:12,718
"Call the cops and you're dead."

53
00:02:13,173 --> 00:02:16,475
So I just stood there and
watched him empty out the safe.

54
00:02:17,711 --> 00:02:19,778
Well, you did the smart thing.

55
00:02:20,814 --> 00:02:22,692
Can he find me?

56
00:02:23,396 --> 00:02:24,894
What do you mean?

57
00:02:24,918 --> 00:02:26,796
I-I don't know how this works.

58
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,564
Is a crime report public?

59
00:02:28,588 --> 00:02:30,283
My name as a witness?

60
00:02:30,308 --> 00:02:32,653
No. Police report is not made public.

61
00:02:32,678 --> 00:02:34,178
So he can't, right?

62
00:02:37,898 --> 00:02:39,642
Full disclosure.

63
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:42,545
A new fairness law
went into effect recently.

64
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:45,448
It requires us to hand over
witnesses' contact information

65
00:02:45,472 --> 00:02:47,450
to the defense attorneys.

66
00:02:47,474 --> 00:02:48,929
You mean, like my address?

67
00:02:48,953 --> 00:02:51,263
Well, yes, but just to the attorneys.

68
00:02:51,288 --> 00:02:52,999
How is that fairness?

69
00:02:53,313 --> 00:02:55,791
I mean, what about
the witnesses, the victims?

70
00:02:55,815 --> 00:02:57,727
How-How's that fair to us?

71
00:02:58,264 --> 00:03:01,030
Katie, Goodman is in Rikers
until the trial.

72
00:03:01,054 --> 00:03:03,519
There is nothing to worry about.

73
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,241
Ms. Hodge?

74
00:03:12,265 --> 00:03:13,910
I was in the building,

75
00:03:13,934 --> 00:03:16,012
thought I'd save myself a trip later.

76
00:03:16,036 --> 00:03:17,380
Goodman case files?

77
00:03:17,404 --> 00:03:19,282
Yes. It's been 15 days.

78
00:03:19,306 --> 00:03:20,847
You're now required by law

79
00:03:20,871 --> 00:03:22,493
to give over the witnesses' information.

80
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:25,054
Actually, the law says
15 days from arraignment,

81
00:03:25,078 --> 00:03:26,656
so I have two more hours.

82
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,658
So you're one of those.

83
00:03:28,682 --> 00:03:29,926
One of what?

84
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,828
I just think it's a sin
to waste a colleague's time.

85
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:35,731
I am happy to save you a trip.

86
00:03:36,485 --> 00:03:38,000
Do me a favor?

87
00:03:38,024 --> 00:03:40,770
Treat this like the loaded weapon it is.

88
00:03:40,794 --> 00:03:42,838
Kind of an overstatement.

89
00:03:42,862 --> 00:03:44,707
Well, maybe.

90
00:03:44,731 --> 00:03:48,010
But your client is
a repeat violent offender.

91
00:03:48,034 --> 00:03:51,180
So yes, the new law says I have
to hand over the contacts.

92
00:03:51,204 --> 00:03:53,149
It does not say you need to download

93
00:03:53,173 --> 00:03:55,178
all the names and addresses to him.

94
00:03:55,475 --> 00:03:56,791
I will do whatever I see fit

95
00:03:56,815 --> 00:03:59,493
to make sure that my client
receives a fair trial.

96
00:03:59,517 --> 00:04:01,229
I am sure you will.

97
00:04:01,253 --> 00:04:02,486
You have a good day.

98
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,341
I will certainly try.

99
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,825
And at 10:30 you are
meeting with Chief Kimura

100
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,227
to review her proposal

101
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:13,727
on new mental health
training initiatives.

102
00:04:13,842 --> 00:04:15,023
At 11:00...

103
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:16,556
Push back my 11:00.

104
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,727
I'm gonna need more time with Kimura.

105
00:04:18,751 --> 00:04:20,961
All right. So 11:30?

106
00:04:20,985 --> 00:04:23,165
- Good.
- Great. So at 11:30

107
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:24,933
you will meet
with Chief Fitzgerald about...

108
00:04:24,957 --> 00:04:28,159
Could it wait five minutes?
We are almost done.

109
00:04:28,183 --> 00:04:30,472
Actually, no, it can't.

110
00:04:30,496 --> 00:04:32,941
A lawsuit's just been filed
against the department

111
00:04:32,965 --> 00:04:35,944
claiming excessive force
was used during an arrest.

112
00:04:35,968 --> 00:04:38,403
So? We get those complaints all the time.

113
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:42,784
The plaintiff is an NYPD detective

114
00:04:42,808 --> 00:04:45,710
who's been deep undercover
the last nine months.

115
00:04:48,586 --> 00:04:50,177
Our officer

116
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:53,451
didn't know he was
taking down a fellow cop.

117
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,068
What do we got?

118
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:02,003
Vic is a white male in his 50s

119
00:05:02,027 --> 00:05:03,405
found this morning by a jogger.

120
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:05,574
Wife, kids and the nanny were
asleep up their apartment.

121
00:05:05,598 --> 00:05:07,042
His name is Felix Roth.

122
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:08,910
- Like the photographer?
- Beats me.

123
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,646
His wife's upstairs... you can
ask her if he takes pictures.

124
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,714
You think?

125
00:05:12,738 --> 00:05:14,049
We got it from here.

126
00:05:14,073 --> 00:05:15,851
Danny, this guy's been all over the news

127
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,219
the past couple of weeks.

128
00:05:17,243 --> 00:05:18,954
- What'd he do?
- Well, more like

129
00:05:18,978 --> 00:05:20,088
what didn't he do?

130
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:21,590
A ton of his former models

131
00:05:21,614 --> 00:05:23,158
came forward claiming sexual assault.

132
00:05:23,182 --> 00:05:24,860
It's up to, like, 20 now,

133
00:05:24,884 --> 00:05:28,219
- and counting. Real nasty stuff, too.
- Really?

134
00:05:29,255 --> 00:05:31,923
So 'twas beauty killed the beast.

135
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:54,037
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

136
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,282
That's the wife, Allie Roth.

137
00:06:01,823 --> 00:06:03,201
All right, thanks.

138
00:06:03,872 --> 00:06:05,549
Mrs. Roth?

139
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:06,966
Detective Reagan.

140
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,739
This is my partner, Detective Baez.

141
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,385
Wanted to offer our condolences.

142
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:12,686
Thank you.

143
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,254
I'm sure this has been
a very difficult time

144
00:06:14,278 --> 00:06:15,923
for your family already,.

145
00:06:15,947 --> 00:06:18,325
The past few weeks have been hell.

146
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:20,461
When's the last time
you saw your husband?

147
00:06:20,485 --> 00:06:21,895
Three days ago.

148
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,565
I asked him to stay at a hotel
until everything blew over.

149
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:25,866
Any idea why he

150
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,835
would come back here last night?

151
00:06:27,859 --> 00:06:29,470
Not a clue.

152
00:06:29,494 --> 00:06:32,506
I have no idea why he'd
be dropping by at that hour.

153
00:06:33,865 --> 00:06:35,676
Where are Thatcher and Everest?

154
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,977
In the playroom.

155
00:06:37,001 --> 00:06:40,112
Detectives, this is our nanny, Melissa.

156
00:06:40,136 --> 00:06:42,516
If you don't mind,
I'd like to check on my kids.

157
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,251
Of course.

158
00:06:44,275 --> 00:06:46,228
Uh, I'm Detective Reagan.

159
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:47,759
This is my partner, Detective Baez.

160
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:49,523
Would you mind if we
ask you a few questions?

161
00:06:49,547 --> 00:06:50,858
- Mm-hmm.
- How long have you worked

162
00:06:50,882 --> 00:06:51,992
for the Roths?

163
00:06:52,016 --> 00:06:54,532
- Um, about a year.
- Is there anything unusual

164
00:06:54,556 --> 00:06:56,697
- we should know about them?
- There's nothing usual

165
00:06:56,721 --> 00:06:57,831
about them.

166
00:06:57,855 --> 00:06:59,500
But Felix was a great father.

167
00:06:59,524 --> 00:07:01,034
He loved his children.

168
00:07:01,058 --> 00:07:02,736
Mm-hmm. Do you live here?

169
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,705
No. I-I live with my dad in the Bronx.

170
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:07,975
But I do stay over when I work
late and have to be in early.

171
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:09,810
So you were here last night?

172
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:11,907
- I was.
- Did you see

173
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,581
or hear anyone enter
or leave the apartment?

174
00:07:14,605 --> 00:07:17,017
No. Uh, Mrs. Roth went to bed before me,

175
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,152
and I didn't hear anything

176
00:07:18,176 --> 00:07:19,820
until the doorman came in with the news.

177
00:07:19,844 --> 00:07:23,390
Any chance Mrs. Roth might have
been involved in this?

178
00:07:23,414 --> 00:07:25,354
God, no. Of course not.

179
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:26,860
I... I mean, they had their issues,

180
00:07:26,884 --> 00:07:28,128
but she loved him.

181
00:07:28,152 --> 00:07:29,463
She could never.

182
00:07:29,487 --> 00:07:32,568
Did you ever see Mr. Roth
bring another woman back here?

183
00:07:32,592 --> 00:07:34,778
No. He wasn't sneaking around.

184
00:07:34,802 --> 00:07:37,104
But you have heard the accusations?

185
00:07:37,128 --> 00:07:38,405
You mean the lies?

186
00:07:38,429 --> 00:07:40,541
He wasn't that kind of man.

187
00:07:40,565 --> 00:07:43,177
Okay? He... he was a lot of things,

188
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:45,702
but he wasn't the monster
they made him out to be.

189
00:07:51,809 --> 00:07:54,254
Hey, Sarge. Heard you wanted to see me.

190
00:07:55,188 --> 00:07:56,723
Do you remember a woman
by the name of Donna Davis?

191
00:07:56,747 --> 00:07:58,926
You wrote an accident report
for her last week.

192
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,442
Oh, yeah, how could I forget?

193
00:08:00,466 --> 00:08:03,263
She was a hot mess. She
ran a car into a stop sign.

194
00:08:03,287 --> 00:08:04,565
Who does that?

195
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:06,500
So you...

196
00:08:06,524 --> 00:08:08,035
completed that report?

197
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:10,237
Yeah. I was... I was riding with Long,

198
00:08:10,261 --> 00:08:12,606
but... I completed the report.

199
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,308
You have any idea
how that accident report

200
00:08:14,332 --> 00:08:16,076
could have ended up in the hands

201
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,312
of some ambulance chaser named Dr. Mehta?

202
00:08:18,336 --> 00:08:20,347
- Wait. What?
- Or do you think

203
00:08:20,371 --> 00:08:22,950
that Long could have sold it
or shared it?

204
00:08:22,974 --> 00:08:24,718
Long? No.

205
00:08:24,742 --> 00:08:26,598
No chance he could've let it
slip into the wrong hands?

206
00:08:26,622 --> 00:08:30,153
No, there's no way.
What is with the third degree?

207
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,392
I hate to say it,
but your partners since me

208
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,728
haven't exactly had
the best track record.

209
00:08:34,752 --> 00:08:36,330
First it was Maya, then Troy...

210
00:08:36,354 --> 00:08:37,331
It's like it's becoming a pattern.

211
00:08:37,355 --> 00:08:39,284
Okay, well, here's a pattern.

212
00:08:39,308 --> 00:08:40,868
Once a report has been processed,

213
00:08:40,892 --> 00:08:43,537
every officer in this precinct
has access to it.

214
00:08:43,561 --> 00:08:45,439
Okay, we'll have to start by following up

215
00:08:45,463 --> 00:08:46,826
with the officer who wrote it.

216
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,209
Wait, you're no longer my sergeant...
You should have given this

217
00:08:49,233 --> 00:08:51,492
- to McNichols to look into.
- If I gave it to McNichols,

218
00:08:51,516 --> 00:08:53,747
she would send it right over
to IAB, as per protocol.

219
00:08:53,771 --> 00:08:54,848
I'm trying to help you out

220
00:08:54,872 --> 00:08:56,027
by getting to the bottom of this.

221
00:08:56,051 --> 00:08:59,085
Well, I don't need your help.
I haven't done anything wrong.

222
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:02,856
<i>Detective Alex Porter</i>

223
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,559
filed the suit, but he
won't pop as a cop.

224
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,761
- How come?
- He used his undercover name.

225
00:09:07,785 --> 00:09:10,287
- So, one good thing.
- Two good things.

226
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:13,133
Porter's been embedded for nine months

227
00:09:13,157 --> 00:09:15,936
with the Satan's Bishops motorcycle gang.

228
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,237
They hate cops.

229
00:09:17,261 --> 00:09:18,572
And how is that a good thing?

230
00:09:18,596 --> 00:09:21,575
Means he probably started
the fight and escalated it...

231
00:09:21,599 --> 00:09:23,410
Another layer of his cover.

232
00:09:23,434 --> 00:09:26,847
And filing a lawsuit for damages
was also part of the play.

233
00:09:26,871 --> 00:09:28,909
Please walk me through the allegations.

234
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:31,418
Porter was part of a protest
outside the courthouse

235
00:09:31,442 --> 00:09:33,487
where the club's president is being tried

236
00:09:33,511 --> 00:09:35,389
on drugs and weapons charges.

237
00:09:35,413 --> 00:09:36,957
Conner and the cops stepped in...

238
00:09:36,981 --> 00:09:39,159
Conner's a first-rate cop, boss.

239
00:09:39,183 --> 00:09:41,428
...when the gang
advanced on the courthouse.

240
00:09:41,452 --> 00:09:42,529
Fights broke out.

241
00:09:42,553 --> 00:09:43,889
Body cams.

242
00:09:43,913 --> 00:09:46,066
Conner was working the detail in uniform,

243
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,835
but he's a detective assigned
to the 3-6 squad.

244
00:09:48,859 --> 00:09:50,429
So he's not required to wear a body cam.

245
00:09:50,453 --> 00:09:51,538
Exactly.

246
00:09:51,562 --> 00:09:52,673
Cell phone video.

247
00:09:52,697 --> 00:09:53,941
None that have surfaced.

248
00:09:53,965 --> 00:09:55,943
Well, there's one out there.

249
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,778
There always is, so find it.

250
00:09:57,802 --> 00:10:00,948
Because we shouldn't
talk to our undercover.

251
00:10:00,972 --> 00:10:03,066
It's not worth the risk.

252
00:10:03,674 --> 00:10:07,070
Well... I'm afraid
that's gonna be my decision.

253
00:10:08,045 --> 00:10:11,158
I'm just saying these bikers
watch each other like hawks.

254
00:10:11,182 --> 00:10:14,261
Their main business
is running illegal firearms

255
00:10:14,285 --> 00:10:15,529
up here from down south.

256
00:10:15,553 --> 00:10:17,230
- I know that.
- There's no loyalty

257
00:10:17,254 --> 00:10:19,299
to a cause, a movement, a religion.

258
00:10:19,323 --> 00:10:21,468
Just a bunch of mercenaries and pirates.

259
00:10:21,492 --> 00:10:23,236
Nobody trusts anybody
despite all the blood oaths

260
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,304
and sacred bonds.

261
00:10:24,328 --> 00:10:25,739
I know that, too.

262
00:10:26,142 --> 00:10:28,577
I saw this documentary.

263
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,311
Let me talk to Conner.

264
00:10:31,335 --> 00:10:33,614
So he can tell you how innocent he is

265
00:10:33,638 --> 00:10:35,048
and you can tell me?

266
00:10:35,072 --> 00:10:37,271
I'm afraid that's only half the story.

267
00:10:37,295 --> 00:10:38,852
Boss, I know Conner. He's a good cop.

268
00:10:38,876 --> 00:10:41,021
Let me get a read. That's my job.

269
00:10:41,045 --> 00:10:42,923
No, that's procedure.

270
00:10:42,947 --> 00:10:45,592
The job is to get a read,
and if it's squirrelly,

271
00:10:45,616 --> 00:10:47,628
report that fact back to me.

272
00:10:47,652 --> 00:10:49,653
Copy that, boss.

273
00:10:56,594 --> 00:10:57,838
Well, it's about time.

274
00:10:57,862 --> 00:10:59,131
I was with Chatwal.

275
00:10:59,155 --> 00:11:01,682
Why's it always got to be you
that stands up to the D.A.?

276
00:11:01,706 --> 00:11:03,744
I don't know.
I guess all of my colleagues

277
00:11:03,768 --> 00:11:06,296
care about the future of their jobs.

278
00:11:06,804 --> 00:11:08,440
And what was your angle?

279
00:11:09,966 --> 00:11:11,652
That you can't have

280
00:11:11,676 --> 00:11:13,887
huge policy changes

281
00:11:13,911 --> 00:11:16,223
without being prepared
on the retail level.

282
00:11:16,247 --> 00:11:18,091
I mean, it's our fault we're not ready,

283
00:11:18,115 --> 00:11:20,131
and the cracks are starting to show.

284
00:11:20,155 --> 00:11:22,763
And when you say our fault,
you mean his fault?

285
00:11:22,787 --> 00:11:24,564
Implied.

286
00:11:24,588 --> 00:11:26,566
But he's not willing to do anything

287
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,335
that might indicate that...

288
00:11:28,359 --> 00:11:30,704
the new laws are anything but perfect.

289
00:11:30,728 --> 00:11:33,306
So we all got to suffer
because of this guy's ego?

290
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,876
Yes, and his reelection chances,

291
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,634
- of course.
- Damn it.

292
00:11:37,658 --> 00:11:38,779
What?

293
00:11:38,803 --> 00:11:39,780
Katie Gray's on her way

294
00:11:39,804 --> 00:11:41,415
to St. Benjamin in an ambulance.

295
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,440
Let's go.

296
00:11:46,965 --> 00:11:49,310
And when I reached down for my keys...

297
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,768
I felt someone behind me.

298
00:11:53,104 --> 00:11:55,939
He shoved me up against the door.

299
00:11:58,142 --> 00:12:00,143
Hit me in my face.

300
00:12:03,381 --> 00:12:05,159
And he threw me on the ground.

301
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,594
We're gonna find whoever did this.

302
00:12:07,618 --> 00:12:09,419
Not with my help.

303
00:12:10,888 --> 00:12:12,533
You told me not to worry.

304
00:12:12,557 --> 00:12:14,435
Now look at me.

305
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:15,803
I understand...

306
00:12:16,385 --> 00:12:18,038
why you feel that way.

307
00:12:18,062 --> 00:12:20,771
But this robbery doesn't
necessarily connect to Goodman.

308
00:12:20,795 --> 00:12:22,810
Okay, you got proof?

309
00:12:22,834 --> 00:12:24,355
No.

310
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:26,353
Then please, just leave.

311
00:12:34,111 --> 00:12:36,362
Let's just give her
some time to calm down.

312
00:12:36,386 --> 00:12:38,158
She's right not to trust me.

313
00:12:38,182 --> 00:12:39,975
Yeah, but you're not
the one that hurt her.

314
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:41,862
Are you the assigned A.D.A.?

315
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,998
Uh, no, she's a witness in another case.

316
00:12:44,022 --> 00:12:45,232
Did you bring her in?

317
00:12:45,256 --> 00:12:46,707
I was the first on the scene.

318
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,859
And it matches a string of robberies

319
00:12:48,883 --> 00:12:49,960
in her neighborhood and...

320
00:12:49,984 --> 00:12:51,294
And then beaten up?

321
00:12:51,318 --> 00:12:53,797
No, just the purses with the others.

322
00:12:53,821 --> 00:12:55,565
So it's not really a match.

323
00:12:55,589 --> 00:12:56,733
Well, not...

324
00:12:56,757 --> 00:12:58,134
exactly, no.

325
00:12:58,158 --> 00:13:00,604
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

326
00:13:01,513 --> 00:13:04,140
This was a loud and clear
warning not to testify.

327
00:13:04,164 --> 00:13:07,143
Yeah, but Marcus Goodman
is still at Rikers.

328
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:09,104
So, he outsourced it.

329
00:13:09,703 --> 00:13:13,316
Look, we owe it
to the rest of the witnesses

330
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,185
on that list to keep them safe.

331
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:17,582
I agree.

332
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:20,857
Did you know that Roth's wife Allie

333
00:13:20,881 --> 00:13:22,025
was a model, too?

334
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:24,628
Yeah, it says here she was
one of his first muses.

335
00:13:24,652 --> 00:13:26,062
Yeah, well, it says in this interview

336
00:13:26,086 --> 00:13:27,797
that they had sex the day they met.

337
00:13:27,821 --> 00:13:29,199
During a photo shoot.

338
00:13:29,223 --> 00:13:30,500
Right on the studio floor.

339
00:13:30,524 --> 00:13:32,745
Soho in the '80s. Times were different.

340
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:34,804
Thanks, Debbie Harry.
The point I'm trying to make is,

341
00:13:34,828 --> 00:13:36,740
that's the same exact move

342
00:13:36,764 --> 00:13:39,477
that all these young women
are accusing him of now.

343
00:13:39,501 --> 00:13:41,211
The move he made on his
wife back in the day.

344
00:13:41,235 --> 00:13:42,245
So?

345
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:43,647
So, if he liked them young

346
00:13:43,671 --> 00:13:44,981
back when he met his wife,

347
00:13:45,005 --> 00:13:46,850
maybe he still likes them young.

348
00:13:46,874 --> 00:13:49,085
And she got sick of being
traded in for newer models,

349
00:13:49,109 --> 00:13:50,487
and finally snapped.

350
00:13:50,511 --> 00:13:51,888
Yes.

351
00:13:51,912 --> 00:13:53,189
I've heard of weaker motives.

352
00:13:53,213 --> 00:13:55,125
Think she's done grieving?

353
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:56,916
Let's go find out.

354
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:04,452
<i>I was new to the city,</i>

355
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:07,922
I was broke,
and he made me an overnight success.

356
00:14:07,946 --> 00:14:09,156
He gave me my life.

357
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,258
Yeah, how did it feel
to watch him continue

358
00:14:11,282 --> 00:14:13,784
to do that to younger girls
year after year?

359
00:14:17,422 --> 00:14:19,166
I didn't watch.

360
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,968
We didn't talk about it.

361
00:14:20,992 --> 00:14:22,636
But, yeah, I knew.

362
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,405
That's why I wanted out.

363
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:26,740
And that's why you murdered your husband?

364
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:28,986
Seriously?

365
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,046
Dead serious.

366
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,413
God, no. No, that's...

367
00:14:32,437 --> 00:14:34,615
that's why I brought the models he abused

368
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,840
to the reporter who broke the story.

369
00:14:38,109 --> 00:14:39,353
What are you talking about?

370
00:14:39,377 --> 00:14:40,621
I'd never see our kids again

371
00:14:40,645 --> 00:14:41,922
if I filed for divorce.

372
00:14:41,946 --> 00:14:43,180
What makes you say that?

373
00:14:44,729 --> 00:14:47,641
Felix is famous and powerful

374
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,295
and highly functional.

375
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,333
And I'm washed up and under
treatment for depression.

376
00:14:52,357 --> 00:14:54,535
So he would've gotten
custody, no doubt about it.

377
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,270
Even my lawyer said so.

378
00:14:56,294 --> 00:14:57,538
Okay, so let me get this straight.

379
00:14:57,562 --> 00:14:59,507
You're telling us that you purposely

380
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:02,510
orchestrated your husband's downfall?

381
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:04,812
It's easy math, Detectives.

382
00:15:04,836 --> 00:15:08,349
No more Felix,
no more Felix-signed prints.

383
00:15:08,373 --> 00:15:10,651
Yes, I killed his reputation.

384
00:15:10,675 --> 00:15:12,937
But I did not kill my husband.

385
00:15:14,062 --> 00:15:15,890
She's holding out on something.

386
00:15:15,914 --> 00:15:17,758
Well, according to the nanny, she was

387
00:15:17,782 --> 00:15:19,460
in the apartment the entire time.

388
00:15:19,484 --> 00:15:21,729
Okay, well, where's the nanny today?

389
00:15:21,753 --> 00:15:23,397
Could be her day off?

390
00:15:23,421 --> 00:15:25,232
Well it's not <i>our</i> day off.

391
00:15:25,256 --> 00:15:27,168
I say we lean in on the nanny.

392
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:30,171
Find out what she really
thinks of her dear family

393
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:32,196
and beloved boss.

394
00:15:36,593 --> 00:15:38,312
That's what they got you doing, Sid...

395
00:15:38,336 --> 00:15:40,781
Retail interviews on civilian complaints?

396
00:15:40,805 --> 00:15:42,016
Just when they pop.

397
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,350
How'd this pop?

398
00:15:43,374 --> 00:15:44,485
How about I ask the questions?

399
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:45,586
Shoot.

400
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,720
Chain of events.

401
00:15:46,744 --> 00:15:48,455
These Satan's Bishops guys

402
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,723
were advancing on the courthouse.

403
00:15:49,747 --> 00:15:51,974
We were under orders to
keep them at the curb.

404
00:15:51,998 --> 00:15:54,033
We ordered them back, they kept going.

405
00:15:54,057 --> 00:15:55,799
- Who laid hands first?
- The biker.

406
00:15:55,823 --> 00:15:58,076
- And you did what?
- Pushed him away.

407
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,800
He kept coming, so I took him down.

408
00:15:59,824 --> 00:16:01,557
- Choke hold?
- No.

409
00:16:01,581 --> 00:16:04,772
- Choke hold light?
- I got a grip.

410
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:06,740
For, like, five seconds.

411
00:16:06,764 --> 00:16:08,542
He was pretty greasy...
You've seen these guys.

412
00:16:08,566 --> 00:16:09,677
Hard to get a handle on them.

413
00:16:09,701 --> 00:16:12,112
- Uh-huh.
- It's all about money.

414
00:16:12,136 --> 00:16:14,727
The way the city pays out,
it's like cops are ATMs.

415
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:16,116
Burns my ass, too.

416
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,218
So you know what I'm saying.

417
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:18,252
Loud and clear.

418
00:16:18,276 --> 00:16:19,687
- But here's the thing.
- Hmm?

419
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,856
Is there any chance you might've
been a little too aggressive?

420
00:16:23,173 --> 00:16:25,192
I know I acted fairly.

421
00:16:25,216 --> 00:16:27,061
And besides, you've seen these guys,

422
00:16:27,085 --> 00:16:28,896
these bikers... They're dirt bags.

423
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,231
Can't affect how you treat them.

424
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:31,432
I know that.

425
00:16:31,682 --> 00:16:33,133
It was all clean.

426
00:16:33,157 --> 00:16:34,568
- Mm-hmm.
- By the book.

427
00:16:34,592 --> 00:16:36,637
And every other guy on the scene
will attest to that.

428
00:16:36,661 --> 00:16:38,205
They got my back.

429
00:16:38,229 --> 00:16:40,908
Uh-huh, they got your back.

430
00:16:40,932 --> 00:16:42,576
Or...

431
00:16:43,193 --> 00:16:45,012
they're hiding the truth.

432
00:16:45,362 --> 00:16:47,014
You have any more questions,

433
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:49,078
I'll see you with a union rep present.

434
00:16:49,102 --> 00:16:50,392
All right, fair enough.

435
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:51,885
What the hell happened to you, Sid?

436
00:16:51,909 --> 00:16:53,910
You used to be one of us.

437
00:16:58,616 --> 00:16:59,860
Hey, Long.

438
00:16:59,884 --> 00:17:01,262
What's up, Sarge?

439
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:03,797
Ask you something? Have you
ever been to a Dr. Mehta?

440
00:17:03,821 --> 00:17:06,000
Yeah. You looking for a new doc?

441
00:17:06,024 --> 00:17:07,401
Just curious.

442
00:17:07,425 --> 00:17:09,236
Well, he's a great guy.

443
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,238
Been helping cops and
their families for years.

444
00:17:11,262 --> 00:17:12,673
Doesn't matter if the stuff is covered.

445
00:17:12,697 --> 00:17:14,675
He's never turned away a boy in blue.

446
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:16,310
Ah, so, you recommend him?

447
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:18,045
You bet your ass I would.

448
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:20,381
Plus, he's been struggling lately.

449
00:17:20,405 --> 00:17:22,231
All these fancy new
urgent cares popping up

450
00:17:22,255 --> 00:17:23,884
all over the city... it's
tough for an old school

451
00:17:23,908 --> 00:17:25,686
GP like him to keep afloat.

452
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:28,022
That why you've been
feeding him accident reports?

453
00:17:28,046 --> 00:17:29,523
Excuse me?

454
00:17:29,547 --> 00:17:31,492
It's been going on, and you
just laid out a perfect reason

455
00:17:31,516 --> 00:17:33,093
why a good guy might
do something like that.

456
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,155
Hey, boss...

457
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:36,970
just move along?

458
00:17:37,407 --> 00:17:39,408
Is that a threat?

459
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,426
There's nothing to see here, I promise.

460
00:17:45,096 --> 00:17:46,407
<i>You know, there's still</i>

461
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:49,376
no proof that Katie's
assault was tied to Marcus.

462
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,114
This isn't on you.

463
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:54,882
I know, just find Ms. Stewart,
offer her protection.

464
00:17:54,906 --> 00:17:57,418
Just play it safe until we know more.

465
00:17:57,442 --> 00:18:00,120
You're not gonna be able to
protect every witness like this.

466
00:18:00,144 --> 00:18:02,289
Why? There's only five of them.

467
00:18:02,313 --> 00:18:05,492
Yeah, I mean, as this problem grows.

468
00:18:05,516 --> 00:18:09,196
Asking cops to watch out
for witnesses and victims

469
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,965
of every case that
this office is prosecuting

470
00:18:11,989 --> 00:18:14,768
is completely unrealistic.

471
00:18:14,792 --> 00:18:18,339
Chatwal is not gonna ask for
special help from One PP.

472
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:19,612
You know 'cause you asked?

473
00:18:19,636 --> 00:18:22,299
Yeah, and he tore me up.

474
00:18:25,236 --> 00:18:27,762
I can see why she likes
staying over at the Roths.

475
00:18:27,786 --> 00:18:29,758
Yeah, me, too.

476
00:18:32,844 --> 00:18:35,779
Melissa, it's Detective
Reagan and Baez. Open up.

477
00:18:40,418 --> 00:18:42,396
Melissa isn't home.

478
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,831
You're her father?

479
00:18:43,855 --> 00:18:45,332
Hector Rodriguez.

480
00:18:45,356 --> 00:18:46,500
Do you mind if we come in

481
00:18:46,524 --> 00:18:48,369
just for a minute,
ask you a few questions?

482
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:49,636
Yes, please.

483
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,694
Thank you.

484
00:18:54,031 --> 00:18:55,442
Thanks.

485
00:18:55,466 --> 00:18:57,179
That's a beautiful statue.

486
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:58,962
Reminds me of my mother's.

487
00:18:58,987 --> 00:19:00,631
That was passed down
to me from my mother.

488
00:19:00,656 --> 00:19:02,067
Oh, yeah? Where you from?

489
00:19:02,483 --> 00:19:04,952
- Monte Cristi.
- Dominican Republic?

490
00:19:04,976 --> 00:19:06,687
Melissa was born here, though.

491
00:19:06,711 --> 00:19:08,188
- I have the papers.
- That's okay.

492
00:19:08,212 --> 00:19:11,225
We're not worried about
her immigration status.

493
00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:13,961
We're more interested in her former boss.

494
00:19:13,985 --> 00:19:15,218
Felix Roth?

495
00:19:16,521 --> 00:19:18,966
I never approved
of her work for that man.

496
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,034
- Why not?
- The money she earned

497
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:22,503
was coming directly from sales

498
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:24,505
of his sinful photos.

499
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:26,774
I told her she wasn't allowed to go back

500
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:28,041
and must quit.

501
00:19:28,065 --> 00:19:30,225
Well, she didn't quit, did she?

502
00:19:30,249 --> 00:19:31,492
No.

503
00:19:31,516 --> 00:19:33,247
She disobeyed me, went back to work,

504
00:19:33,271 --> 00:19:35,912
and now she's mixed up
in this murder investigation.

505
00:19:35,912 --> 00:19:37,824
- Right.
- Have you noticed anything

506
00:19:37,848 --> 00:19:39,425
off about her recently?

507
00:19:39,449 --> 00:19:40,927
She acting any differently?

508
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:43,696
I barely recognize her anymore.

509
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,931
Do you know where she is?

510
00:19:44,955 --> 00:19:46,165
We had a fight.

511
00:19:46,189 --> 00:19:47,435
She took off.

512
00:19:47,459 --> 00:19:49,325
What did you two fight about?

513
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,039
She told me she was pregnant.

514
00:19:53,063 --> 00:19:55,760
Does she have a boyfriend?

515
00:19:57,601 --> 00:19:59,312
What's it matter?

516
00:19:59,336 --> 00:20:01,314
She said she wanted to get rid of it.

517
00:20:01,338 --> 00:20:03,049
My grandchild.

518
00:20:03,073 --> 00:20:04,784
Do you know where she went

519
00:20:04,808 --> 00:20:06,252
after you two had a fight?

520
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:10,179
I've been calling her
but she won't answer.

521
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:15,295
Melissa was calling and texting

522
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:18,498
a number registered to
Felix Roth Studios all hours.

523
00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:20,233
Felix had a second number?

524
00:20:20,257 --> 00:20:21,234
Yep.

525
00:20:21,258 --> 00:20:23,736
- His business.
- Mm-hmm.

526
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,440
So maybe Melissa was
more than just his nanny.

527
00:20:27,918 --> 00:20:29,542
Explains why she defended him.

528
00:20:29,566 --> 00:20:31,377
Also explains something else.

529
00:20:31,401 --> 00:20:32,679
What?

530
00:20:32,703 --> 00:20:34,280
She's pregnant.

531
00:20:34,603 --> 00:20:36,804
What if Felix is the father?

532
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,019
Explains why Mrs. Roth

533
00:20:40,043 --> 00:20:41,721
would have been angry enough to kill him.

534
00:20:41,745 --> 00:20:43,690
Yeah. Now we just have to explain

535
00:20:43,714 --> 00:20:45,591
why Mrs. Roth sent Melissa

536
00:20:45,615 --> 00:20:47,627
a $10,000 Venmo payment.

537
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:50,853
Uh, maybe a very generous
Christmas bonus?

538
00:20:51,888 --> 00:20:53,633
At the end of January?

539
00:20:53,657 --> 00:20:56,402
Well, what do you think it is,
hush money?

540
00:20:56,426 --> 00:20:58,949
There's only way to find out.

541
00:20:59,596 --> 00:21:00,873
Forget Conner's a cop.

542
00:21:00,897 --> 00:21:02,108
Think of him as a perp.

543
00:21:02,132 --> 00:21:03,743
You still buying the whole hog?

544
00:21:04,204 --> 00:21:05,401
Yes.

545
00:21:06,536 --> 00:21:07,814
The whole hog?

546
00:21:07,838 --> 00:21:10,049
I don't think what happened
rises to the level

547
00:21:10,073 --> 00:21:11,784
of a complaint and a payout.

548
00:21:11,808 --> 00:21:12,919
Payout?

549
00:21:12,943 --> 00:21:15,288
- Yeah.
- Policy on settling complaints

550
00:21:15,312 --> 00:21:17,223
is not in your purview. Clear?

551
00:21:17,247 --> 00:21:18,591
- Yes.
- Nor is being

552
00:21:18,615 --> 00:21:21,227
the rank and file's favorite uncle.

553
00:21:21,251 --> 00:21:22,895
Well, those days are gone.

554
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:25,598
Give me a break. You bucking
to be back in a precinct?

555
00:21:25,622 --> 00:21:27,556
- No.
- Then cut it out.

556
00:21:31,194 --> 00:21:34,407
My account of the conversation
would be that Detective Conner

557
00:21:34,431 --> 00:21:36,409
used appropriate force.

558
00:21:36,433 --> 00:21:39,078
Okay? He framed his recounting
in a way that might help

559
00:21:39,102 --> 00:21:40,780
keep his balls out of the wringer,

560
00:21:40,804 --> 00:21:43,839
which is insurance
any smart cop would take out.

561
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,152
Come in.

562
00:21:46,176 --> 00:21:48,788
I just got word
that two more citizens arrested

563
00:21:48,812 --> 00:21:51,290
at that protest filed similar complaints.

564
00:21:51,314 --> 00:21:53,192
"Citizens"? You know
what those guys call themselves?

565
00:21:53,216 --> 00:21:55,895
Satan's Bishops!
Don't give me "citizens."

566
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,653
Porter's a cop!

567
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,035
I would remind you
that the first complaint

568
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:05,223
came from one of our own.

569
00:22:08,024 --> 00:22:09,811
Yes, sir.

570
00:22:13,606 --> 00:22:16,038
Anything I can do?

571
00:22:17,986 --> 00:22:19,218
Yeah.

572
00:22:19,242 --> 00:22:21,410
Can you do the impossible?

573
00:22:31,546 --> 00:22:32,986
I can have this ready
for you in five minutes.

574
00:22:33,011 --> 00:22:34,397
- Hey.
- Yeah. Perfect.

575
00:22:34,422 --> 00:22:36,133
Hey. Uh, I'm glad I caught you.

576
00:22:36,158 --> 00:22:37,669
Did you talk to Long?

577
00:22:37,879 --> 00:22:40,488
Yeah. He said there's nothing to see.

578
00:22:40,489 --> 00:22:41,934
Jamie, I really think
that you should just drop

579
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:43,101
this whole thing.
Which is a lot different

580
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:45,637
than saying I know nothing about this.

581
00:22:45,661 --> 00:22:47,105
I got to take this to IAB.

582
00:22:47,129 --> 00:22:48,307
No, you don't.

583
00:22:48,331 --> 00:22:49,641
Yeah, of course I do.

584
00:22:49,665 --> 00:22:52,144
Jamie, this is a lot
bigger than you think.

585
00:22:52,168 --> 00:22:53,312
Okay.

586
00:22:53,336 --> 00:22:54,813
What does... what does that mean?

587
00:22:54,837 --> 00:22:57,416
Multiple cops, multiple precincts.

588
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,151
All feeding this guy reports?

589
00:22:59,175 --> 00:23:00,485
That's what I'm hearing.

590
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:02,020
- Then I got to do something.
- No.

591
00:23:02,044 --> 00:23:03,221
You got to get to the bottom of it.

592
00:23:03,245 --> 00:23:04,656
That's what you got to do.

593
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,093
These guys are passing out
people's private information.

594
00:23:08,117 --> 00:23:09,261
They are breaking the law.

595
00:23:09,285 --> 00:23:11,797
Do you ever consider how this affects me?

596
00:23:12,373 --> 00:23:13,665
What are you talking about?

597
00:23:13,689 --> 00:23:15,567
All these guys,
they think that I'm a rat,

598
00:23:15,591 --> 00:23:18,136
and I'm coming in and running
and I'm tattling to the boss.

599
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,639
That is not what I meant to happen.

600
00:23:20,663 --> 00:23:22,259
Then handle it.

601
00:23:22,865 --> 00:23:24,876
There's dinner in the fridge.

602
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:26,578
You cooked?

603
00:23:26,602 --> 00:23:27,980
It tastes a lot like the taco truck

604
00:23:28,004 --> 00:23:29,571
from up the street.

605
00:23:40,783 --> 00:23:44,296
You ever feel like you woke up
in an alternate universe?

606
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,598
Like a, um, like an Opposite Day?

607
00:23:46,622 --> 00:23:49,301
No, more like an Opposite World.

608
00:23:49,325 --> 00:23:50,969
Where it's like what?

609
00:23:50,993 --> 00:23:52,304
Where it's like the one person

610
00:23:52,328 --> 00:23:53,639
in this murder case

611
00:23:53,663 --> 00:23:56,508
who liked the victim, who
actually stood up for the victim

612
00:23:56,532 --> 00:23:58,010
is suddenly nowhere to be found.

613
00:23:58,034 --> 00:24:00,612
But all the likely suspects
are everywhere to be found?

614
00:24:00,636 --> 00:24:03,815
Exactly. The betrayed wife,
the young women

615
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:05,317
he's accused of assaulting
throughout the years,

616
00:24:05,341 --> 00:24:06,752
they're all ready, willing

617
00:24:06,776 --> 00:24:09,388
and able to cooperate 24/7.

618
00:24:09,412 --> 00:24:11,089
I got one of my cops

619
00:24:11,113 --> 00:24:13,825
accusing another of my
cops of excessive force.

620
00:24:13,849 --> 00:24:16,128
I guess that's an Opposite World.

621
00:24:16,152 --> 00:24:18,953
The cop got a beef
with the cop they're accusing?

622
00:24:20,608 --> 00:24:24,092
Well... it's, uh, complicated.

623
00:24:26,108 --> 00:24:27,773
Oh. Well, who do you believe?

624
00:24:27,797 --> 00:24:31,009
Okay. I mean, here's the thing.

625
00:24:31,033 --> 00:24:32,511
In my usual world,

626
00:24:32,535 --> 00:24:35,514
I could just lean in on
the officer's account.

627
00:24:35,538 --> 00:24:36,615
I know their training.

628
00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:38,850
I know the oath that they take.

629
00:24:38,874 --> 00:24:40,652
Hell, I recited it to most of them.

630
00:24:40,676 --> 00:24:44,523
But in this case,
they're both my officers.

631
00:24:44,547 --> 00:24:47,325
Hmm. I guess that's Opposite World.

632
00:24:47,349 --> 00:24:48,460
There you go.

633
00:24:48,484 --> 00:24:50,562
I think you might be onto something here.

634
00:24:50,586 --> 00:24:51,997
Wow. If you agree with me,

635
00:24:52,021 --> 00:24:54,066
- then I know it must be Opposite World.
- No.

636
00:24:55,157 --> 00:24:56,435
I'm trying to wrap my head around why

637
00:24:56,459 --> 00:24:58,470
I'm now required by law

638
00:24:58,494 --> 00:25:00,772
to hand over the witnesses' names,

639
00:25:00,796 --> 00:25:02,374
addresses, everything

640
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:04,142
to the attorney for the defendant.

641
00:25:04,528 --> 00:25:05,700
As in the attorney

642
00:25:05,724 --> 00:25:07,612
- can share it with the defendant?
- It's like,

643
00:25:07,636 --> 00:25:09,347
just, "Here it is. Here's everyone

644
00:25:09,371 --> 00:25:11,450
"that is going to testify against you

645
00:25:11,474 --> 00:25:12,684
and how to get ahold of 'em."

646
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:14,051
It's like I woke up in...

647
00:25:14,075 --> 00:25:15,584
Telling you, it's a real thing.

648
00:25:15,608 --> 00:25:17,556
Now you guys got me thinking like this.

649
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,909
- How's that?
- I got these cops that I think

650
00:25:19,933 --> 00:25:23,161
are sidelining as shills for
a doc-in-a-box in our precinct,

651
00:25:23,185 --> 00:25:25,197
and I haven't sent it up to IAB yet.

652
00:25:25,673 --> 00:25:27,132
You didn't hear that.

653
00:25:27,156 --> 00:25:28,433
Hey, hear what?

654
00:25:28,457 --> 00:25:30,736
Because something tells me

655
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,704
that maybe things aren't what they seem.

656
00:25:32,728 --> 00:25:33,983
In Opposite World.

657
00:25:34,007 --> 00:25:36,007
- Opposite World.
- That's right.

658
00:25:36,031 --> 00:25:37,142
Opposite World.

659
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:39,501
Telling you.

660
00:25:46,075 --> 00:25:48,042
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

661
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:03,401
I'm not gonna do this again.

662
00:26:03,425 --> 00:26:04,870
Do what?

663
00:26:04,894 --> 00:26:06,772
I know that look.

664
00:26:09,175 --> 00:26:11,761
Yes, I need your help.

665
00:26:17,795 --> 00:26:19,418
And there it is.

666
00:26:21,177 --> 00:26:23,388
Call Baker and make an appointment.

667
00:26:23,412 --> 00:26:25,578
I'd like to keep this off the books.

668
00:26:25,602 --> 00:26:28,593
And I would rather keep a
separation of church and state

669
00:26:28,617 --> 00:26:30,196
between you and me.

670
00:26:33,074 --> 00:26:35,901
Our witnesses and victims are at risk

671
00:26:35,925 --> 00:26:37,692
with this new disclosure law.

672
00:26:38,727 --> 00:26:41,425
Laws I had no hand in writing.

673
00:26:41,449 --> 00:26:42,974
You didn't write 'em, any of 'em,

674
00:26:42,998 --> 00:26:45,010
but you do uphold them.

675
00:26:46,712 --> 00:26:48,680
Why are you carrying
Chatwal's water again?

676
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:51,349
Look, he is not going to ask
for extra protection

677
00:26:51,373 --> 00:26:53,251
because he thinks it will reflect poorly

678
00:26:53,275 --> 00:26:56,054
on the criminal justice reform
that he championed.

679
00:26:56,431 --> 00:26:58,290
And he'd be right.

680
00:26:58,314 --> 00:27:00,292
My fight

681
00:27:00,768 --> 00:27:03,962
is for the innocent people at risk,

682
00:27:03,986 --> 00:27:06,354
and I need your help.

683
00:27:08,357 --> 00:27:10,902
Erin, I will do everything I can

684
00:27:10,926 --> 00:27:13,104
to keep those people safe.

685
00:27:13,128 --> 00:27:14,940
But your office needs

686
00:27:14,964 --> 00:27:17,576
to work out flaws in your system.

687
00:27:18,433 --> 00:27:19,912
Your office.

688
00:27:22,004 --> 00:27:23,625
Not mine.

689
00:27:36,346 --> 00:27:37,863
How was the tour?

690
00:27:37,887 --> 00:27:39,865
Another day at the office.

691
00:27:39,889 --> 00:27:41,199
Uneventful, huh?

692
00:27:41,223 --> 00:27:42,934
- Just the way you like it?
- Look,

693
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:45,269
I know you think
you got to turn this over.

694
00:27:45,293 --> 00:27:46,471
I get it.

695
00:27:46,495 --> 00:27:49,464
- But just do me one favor, okay?
- What's that?

696
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,041
Come meet me here at
the end of your tour.

697
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:59,851
You want me to wait to make
the notification to IAB?

698
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:02,520
Please, boss. I'm not a bad guy.

699
00:28:02,544 --> 00:28:04,256
I'm trying to do the right thing here.

700
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,757
Just trust me, okay?

701
00:28:05,781 --> 00:28:07,325
One condition.

702
00:28:07,349 --> 00:28:08,455
Anything.

703
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:10,061
You lay off Eddie and spread the word.

704
00:28:10,085 --> 00:28:11,853
She had nothing to do with this.

705
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,847
Someone's at the door.

706
00:28:44,288 --> 00:28:45,497
Henry.

707
00:28:45,521 --> 00:28:47,766
<i>Seven Pillars of Wisdom</i> author.

708
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,034
Starts with a "T."

709
00:28:49,058 --> 00:28:50,458
T.E. Lawrence.

710
00:28:52,547 --> 00:28:53,995
Thanks.

711
00:29:00,269 --> 00:29:02,236
So, how are you doing, Detective?

712
00:29:03,272 --> 00:29:04,983
Okay.

713
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,901
Except for this.

714
00:29:08,104 --> 00:29:09,554
Want to sit down?

715
00:29:10,106 --> 00:29:11,579
Sure.

716
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:15,319
Coffee?

717
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,931
So, you got a problem with this meeting.

718
00:29:19,955 --> 00:29:21,033
Yeah.

719
00:29:21,957 --> 00:29:24,258
Yes... sir.

720
00:29:25,694 --> 00:29:27,631
Okay. If you were me,
what would you have done?

721
00:29:27,655 --> 00:29:30,275
Taken my word I was the victim
of excessive force

722
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:31,884
by an NYPD officer.

723
00:29:31,908 --> 00:29:34,813
- A fellow detective.
- Yes,

724
00:29:34,837 --> 00:29:36,214
which makes it even worse.

725
00:29:36,238 --> 00:29:38,750
The higher up you rise,
the more you should know better.

726
00:29:38,774 --> 00:29:41,252
We do take you at your word.

727
00:29:41,276 --> 00:29:43,144
Then why the off-campus get-together?

728
00:29:44,246 --> 00:29:47,559
Part of my job is to protect your cover.

729
00:29:47,583 --> 00:29:50,980
But as you know, we do
have to get both sides.

730
00:29:52,688 --> 00:29:55,967
And his side was... Let me guess...

731
00:29:55,991 --> 00:29:58,988
Appropriate action
under the circumstances.

732
00:29:59,395 --> 00:30:01,601
- That's about it.
- That being

733
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:03,808
his full weight on his knee in my kidney

734
00:30:03,832 --> 00:30:05,710
and then his knee in my crotch,

735
00:30:05,734 --> 00:30:08,446
with his mitt on my windpipe

736
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:11,439
and a kick to the head for dessert.

737
00:30:19,014 --> 00:30:21,960
And it is your belief you sustained that

738
00:30:21,984 --> 00:30:24,229
in your action with Detective Conner?

739
00:30:24,639 --> 00:30:26,921
Yes, sir, that's my belief.

740
00:30:31,627 --> 00:30:34,606
Okay, who put hands on first?

741
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:36,150
I did.

742
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:38,777
I'm playing a role.

743
00:30:38,801 --> 00:30:42,080
I need to be convincing in that role.

744
00:30:42,104 --> 00:30:44,315
I tried to tell him I was undercover.

745
00:30:44,339 --> 00:30:46,651
I said it right to him. "I'm an uncle."

746
00:30:46,675 --> 00:30:48,153
You sure he heard you?

747
00:30:48,177 --> 00:30:49,487
Honestly, it...

748
00:30:49,511 --> 00:30:51,489
it might have come out
a little messed up,

749
00:30:51,513 --> 00:30:53,691
what with the choke hold he had on me.

750
00:30:53,715 --> 00:30:54,926
So no.

751
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,551
But that doesn't clear him.

752
00:30:57,719 --> 00:31:00,965
Why not let someone
else file a complaint?

753
00:31:00,989 --> 00:31:03,701
Why is it you who goes the extra mile?

754
00:31:03,725 --> 00:31:05,203
Come on.

755
00:31:05,227 --> 00:31:08,473
Bunch of outlaw bikers crying
"that cop roughed me up"?

756
00:31:08,497 --> 00:31:10,809
How seriously do you think
that would land?

757
00:31:10,833 --> 00:31:13,311
You sent me undercover

758
00:31:13,335 --> 00:31:14,646
to root out some bad guys.

759
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:18,339
You didn't say only these bad guys.

760
00:31:19,675 --> 00:31:21,853
If I see the guns they run
up here getting delivered

761
00:31:21,877 --> 00:31:23,822
to the Convent of the Sacred Heart,

762
00:31:23,846 --> 00:31:26,291
I'm giving up the nuns.

763
00:31:26,315 --> 00:31:28,426
Same as this cop.

764
00:31:28,756 --> 00:31:30,624
That's how I see the job.

765
00:31:36,225 --> 00:31:39,170
Here's some cell phone video
that caught my arrest.

766
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,909
You're welcome
for me not making it public.

767
00:32:01,617 --> 00:32:02,943
This it?

768
00:32:02,967 --> 00:32:05,563
TARU said Melissa's phone
pinged in the vicinity

769
00:32:05,587 --> 00:32:07,432
of 37 Prince Street about 20 minutes ago.

770
00:32:07,456 --> 00:32:10,235
- It's got to be it.
- Well, it looks like a doctor's office.

771
00:32:10,578 --> 00:32:12,211
- It's a gynecologist.
- That appropriate?

772
00:32:12,235 --> 00:32:14,546
- Should we wait outside?
- What? Are you serious?

773
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:17,075
We've been looking for her
for two days. For all we know,

774
00:32:17,099 --> 00:32:19,911
she's probably come and gone.
We have to go inside.

775
00:32:19,935 --> 00:32:22,403
Okay. We'll go inside.

776
00:32:27,442 --> 00:32:30,155
Melissa, we need to talk to you.

777
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:31,789
This is none of your business.

778
00:32:31,813 --> 00:32:33,351
No, it <i>is</i> our business.

779
00:32:34,502 --> 00:32:36,603
Is Felix the father?

780
00:32:38,648 --> 00:32:39,840
Yes.

781
00:32:41,223 --> 00:32:43,568
Then, who found out about it
and killed him?

782
00:32:43,592 --> 00:32:45,370
I don't know what you're talking about.

783
00:32:45,394 --> 00:32:46,638
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

784
00:32:46,662 --> 00:32:49,007
Look, we know that Allie wired you money.

785
00:32:49,031 --> 00:32:51,009
You've been on the run for two days.

786
00:32:51,033 --> 00:32:53,244
Allie didn't kill him.
She could never. She...

787
00:32:53,268 --> 00:32:54,946
She just told me

788
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:56,781
to lay low until the press dies down.

789
00:32:56,805 --> 00:32:59,350
She gave me a place to stay,
paid for this appointment.

790
00:32:59,374 --> 00:33:01,555
Well, your father thinks
you're not having this baby.

791
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:04,990
Yeah, well, I don't know how I'd
support it on my own. Don't you see?

792
00:33:05,014 --> 00:33:07,282
Allie was kind enough
to make me an appointment here

793
00:33:07,306 --> 00:33:08,793
to consider my options.

794
00:33:08,817 --> 00:33:10,128
Kind enough?

795
00:33:10,152 --> 00:33:11,262
She's not kind.

796
00:33:11,286 --> 00:33:12,386
She's playing you.

797
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:14,058
If Felix is the father,

798
00:33:14,082 --> 00:33:16,434
she'll have to share
half the estate with you.

799
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:18,326
And she's not gonna do that.

800
00:33:19,314 --> 00:33:21,692
Okay, but Allie didn't kill him.

801
00:33:22,496 --> 00:33:24,027
Then who <i>did</i> kill him?

802
00:33:25,874 --> 00:33:27,948
Come on, Melissa. If you know
who killed him, you got to tell us.

803
00:33:27,973 --> 00:33:30,756
I couldn't admit to him
that I'd had consensual sex,

804
00:33:30,781 --> 00:33:32,659
so I told him Felix raped me, okay?

805
00:33:32,684 --> 00:33:35,296
Like they said
he did to all the other girls.

806
00:33:36,873 --> 00:33:39,346
When I told him, he said I was tainted.

807
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:41,325
He was more upset
than I had ever seen him, and...

808
00:33:41,349 --> 00:33:43,595
Okay. Who is "he"?

809
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:46,087
Who is the "he" that killed Felix?

810
00:33:50,605 --> 00:33:51,970
My father.

811
00:34:10,868 --> 00:34:12,112
Hey.

812
00:34:12,136 --> 00:34:13,814
Looking for Hector Rodriguez.

813
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:16,449
- Seen him?
- I don't know any Hector Rodriguez.

814
00:34:16,473 --> 00:34:18,518
Says he don't know Hector.

815
00:34:18,542 --> 00:34:20,287
Well, that's funny
'cause his daughter said

816
00:34:20,311 --> 00:34:21,558
he practically lives here.

817
00:34:21,582 --> 00:34:23,323
Yeah, I'm sorry. No Hector tonight.

818
00:34:23,347 --> 00:34:25,158
So you <i>do</i> know Hector?

819
00:34:25,182 --> 00:34:27,160
Hey! Talking to you.

820
00:34:27,184 --> 00:34:29,262
Yeah, but he's not here.

821
00:34:29,842 --> 00:34:31,232
Okay, play stupid.

822
00:34:31,256 --> 00:34:34,434
Anybody want to point us in the
direction of Hector Rodriguez?

823
00:34:35,629 --> 00:34:36,803
No? Okay.

824
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:39,072
Maybe we'll start checking
all your papers then, huh?

825
00:34:39,629 --> 00:34:41,530
What do you say?

826
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:45,846
Hey. What the hell are you doing?

827
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:47,347
- Excuse me?
- What are you doing

828
00:34:47,371 --> 00:34:48,648
right there with the button?

829
00:34:48,672 --> 00:34:49,749
Where does the button ring?

830
00:34:49,773 --> 00:34:50,917
Basement? Bathroom?

831
00:34:50,941 --> 00:34:51,989
What?

832
00:34:52,509 --> 00:34:54,010
Okay.

833
00:34:55,646 --> 00:34:56,776
Step back.

834
00:34:56,801 --> 00:34:58,712
You, move. Come on. Move!

835
00:34:58,737 --> 00:34:59,914
All right.

836
00:35:00,117 --> 00:35:01,184
Get back.

837
00:35:05,514 --> 00:35:07,382
Hector?

838
00:35:21,338 --> 00:35:23,095
- Hector! Hold it!
- Go! Go! Go!

839
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:25,585
Wait!

840
00:35:25,609 --> 00:35:27,161
Hold it!

841
00:35:27,185 --> 00:35:29,222
Hey!

842
00:35:29,246 --> 00:35:31,024
Go!

843
00:35:32,816 --> 00:35:34,995
Get your hands where I can see
'em right now! Get 'em up!

844
00:35:35,019 --> 00:35:36,963
- All right. No, no, no, no.
- Hands up!

845
00:35:36,987 --> 00:35:39,401
No, no, no, I got nothing.
Driver, get your hands up, too.

846
00:35:39,425 --> 00:35:41,368
Keep 'em where
I can see 'em now! Hands up!

847
00:35:41,392 --> 00:35:43,169
Out of the car. Come on.
Hands on the vehicle.

848
00:35:43,193 --> 00:35:44,458
Right there.

849
00:35:45,429 --> 00:35:47,407
I'm ready to atone for my sins.

850
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,876
I made a terrible mistake.

851
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,445
I didn't mean to hurt him,

852
00:35:51,469 --> 00:35:52,979
but he called her a whore,

853
00:35:53,003 --> 00:35:55,115
and laughing at me.

854
00:35:55,139 --> 00:35:56,917
I'm so sorry.

855
00:35:56,941 --> 00:35:59,386
Roth got what he deserved.

856
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:01,577
The judge'll decide what you get.

857
00:36:04,603 --> 00:36:05,792
<i>This morning,</i>

858
00:36:05,816 --> 00:36:07,661
the police arrested a suspect trying

859
00:36:07,685 --> 00:36:10,297
to break in to one
of the witnesses' homes.

860
00:36:10,321 --> 00:36:12,565
And this concerns me how?

861
00:36:12,589 --> 00:36:15,936
The suspect is your client's
younger brother Michael.

862
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,971
He was found with Katie Gray's ID

863
00:36:17,995 --> 00:36:19,090
and credit cards.

864
00:36:19,114 --> 00:36:21,241
And he's not my client.

865
00:36:21,265 --> 00:36:23,566
- His brother is.
- Wow.

866
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:25,145
- That's a fact.
- It's also

867
00:36:25,169 --> 00:36:26,381
a fact that there's a direct line

868
00:36:26,405 --> 00:36:28,415
from that witness list,
that you yourself took

869
00:36:28,439 --> 00:36:30,317
from this office, to that suspect.

870
00:36:30,341 --> 00:36:32,108
I had no idea.

871
00:36:33,143 --> 00:36:35,121
Wasting people's time is a sin.

872
00:36:35,145 --> 00:36:36,423
I am with you there.

873
00:36:36,447 --> 00:36:38,291
But taking a flawed law

874
00:36:38,315 --> 00:36:40,527
and using it
for your own personal gain...

875
00:36:40,551 --> 00:36:42,529
That is a lot worse.

876
00:36:43,389 --> 00:36:45,899
I am just doing what I'm paid for.

877
00:36:45,923 --> 00:36:48,401
Said every coward ever. Now please leave.

878
00:36:48,425 --> 00:36:51,438
All I did was review the list
of witnesses with my client.

879
00:36:51,462 --> 00:36:52,895
- Get out.
- I didn't give...

880
00:36:57,801 --> 00:36:59,369
Hello.

881
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:07,554
Now, what she did is
not wrong under the law.

882
00:37:07,578 --> 00:37:09,289
All she did was

883
00:37:09,313 --> 00:37:12,325
give her client the witness list
that we handed over.

884
00:37:12,796 --> 00:37:14,995
So we'll fix it.

885
00:37:15,424 --> 00:37:16,730
So, what are we gonna do?

886
00:37:16,754 --> 00:37:19,766
Just give fake names and addresses?

887
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:22,258
Actually, that's not a bad idea.

888
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:30,577
Just feels like we keep pushing
the same mountain all the time.

889
00:37:30,601 --> 00:37:32,012
Well, hey,

890
00:37:32,036 --> 00:37:35,138
even if we only get an inch,
that's something, right?

891
00:37:41,178 --> 00:37:43,860
<i>We'll conduct</i> a thorough investigation,

892
00:37:43,884 --> 00:37:46,493
make sure this isn't a habit
he got covered up.

893
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:48,428
I watched the video.

894
00:37:48,452 --> 00:37:49,963
He didn't just cross a line.

895
00:37:49,987 --> 00:37:51,831
He drove right over it

896
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:53,533
- and then backed up again.
- No one just

897
00:37:53,557 --> 00:37:55,810
wakes up one day
and decides to act like that.

898
00:37:55,834 --> 00:37:57,303
Conner's our guy, too.

899
00:37:57,327 --> 00:37:58,772
He deserves the benefit of the doubt.

900
00:37:58,796 --> 00:38:00,473
Are you really still defending him?

901
00:38:00,497 --> 00:38:02,242
He deserves due process.

902
00:38:02,266 --> 00:38:04,344
No spin is gonna change what we saw.

903
00:38:04,368 --> 00:38:06,803
Come on, guys. Whose
side are you on anyway?

904
00:38:09,026 --> 00:38:10,271
Sid.

905
00:38:11,567 --> 00:38:13,134
Boss?

906
00:38:15,779 --> 00:38:18,258
Money and manpower on an investigation?

907
00:38:18,779 --> 00:38:20,260
Seriously?

908
00:38:20,284 --> 00:38:21,661
No?

909
00:38:22,116 --> 00:38:23,659
No.

910
00:38:27,142 --> 00:38:28,789
What's he got coming?

911
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:33,072
Um... you tell me.

912
00:38:33,097 --> 00:38:34,586
No.

913
00:38:35,025 --> 00:38:36,547
You tell me.

914
00:38:41,927 --> 00:38:43,846
It's not for me to decide.

915
00:38:44,408 --> 00:38:46,598
But I asked you.

916
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:49,089
Boss?

917
00:38:49,272 --> 00:38:50,769
Lieutenant.

918
00:38:54,189 --> 00:38:55,695
Place Detective Conner

919
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:58,454
on modified assignment
pending an investigation?

920
00:39:02,365 --> 00:39:04,658
Slap on the wrist, given what we know.

921
00:39:06,463 --> 00:39:08,431
Fleet services?

922
00:39:17,274 --> 00:39:19,352
That kind of bad apple can do damage

923
00:39:19,376 --> 00:39:21,050
we only learn about too late.

924
00:39:22,111 --> 00:39:24,112
Better to be proactive.

925
00:39:25,115 --> 00:39:27,193
Suspension, effective immediately.

926
00:39:27,973 --> 00:39:30,987
Have the department advocate
prepare charges and specs.

927
00:39:36,251 --> 00:39:38,229
Pretty harsh.

928
00:39:38,254 --> 00:39:40,188
Yeah. Sends a message.

929
00:39:42,071 --> 00:39:43,810
And that's your call?

930
00:39:45,115 --> 00:39:46,936
Well... he left us no choice.

931
00:39:48,939 --> 00:39:50,371
Then get on it.

932
00:39:51,353 --> 00:39:53,354
Right away, boss.

933
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:28,154
Thanks for coming.

934
00:40:28,575 --> 00:40:30,190
Jochens, what are you doing here?

935
00:40:30,214 --> 00:40:32,825
You remember when I busted
my back at the Academy?

936
00:40:32,849 --> 00:40:33,935
Of course.

937
00:40:33,959 --> 00:40:36,377
Dr. Mehta's the one who got me
back on my feet.

938
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:37,608
All right, but that doesn't...

939
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,933
And remember when we took
that call at the Bedford Houses,

940
00:40:39,957 --> 00:40:41,334
back when we were in the 12th?

941
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:42,969
Yeah, you went down pretty good.

942
00:40:42,993 --> 00:40:44,804
- And I thought I wasn't gonna...
- Dr. Mehta

943
00:40:44,828 --> 00:40:46,272
helped you recover.

944
00:40:46,296 --> 00:40:47,785
- You starting to follow along?
- Yeah.

945
00:40:47,809 --> 00:40:49,909
I understand
the doc here helped you all out,

946
00:40:49,933 --> 00:40:51,177
but what you're doing is wrong.

947
00:40:51,201 --> 00:40:52,745
Says who?

948
00:40:52,769 --> 00:40:54,581
All we're doing is recommending a doc

949
00:40:54,605 --> 00:40:56,583
we trust to people that
we helped out on the streets.

950
00:40:56,607 --> 00:40:58,017
Actually, you're driving business

951
00:40:58,041 --> 00:41:00,119
to the doc, using private information

952
00:41:00,143 --> 00:41:02,555
that's entrusted to you
as NYPD police officers.

953
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:04,524
May I say something?

954
00:41:04,807 --> 00:41:06,341
Shoot.

955
00:41:07,524 --> 00:41:10,103
I could barely cover my rent already.

956
00:41:10,454 --> 00:41:13,566
Then, last month,
they upped it on me again.

957
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:16,459
I was about to close up shop,
when these officers...

958
00:41:18,583 --> 00:41:21,574
...got wind and came to my rescue.

959
00:41:21,598 --> 00:41:23,142
You notice that fancy

960
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:25,345
- new urgent care next door?
- I'm sure

961
00:41:25,369 --> 00:41:28,135
it doesn't help, but I can't
allow this to continue.

962
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:32,185
We came up with a compromise.

963
00:41:32,209 --> 00:41:33,553
Which is?

964
00:41:34,057 --> 00:41:36,155
We help him out the right way...

965
00:41:36,179 --> 00:41:39,519
By recommending him
to friends, family, or

966
00:41:39,543 --> 00:41:41,231
whoever we can get to listen.

967
00:41:41,571 --> 00:41:43,182
No more using the reports.

968
00:41:43,207 --> 00:41:45,618
And you expect me to just forget
about what went on up to now?

969
00:41:45,643 --> 00:41:47,855
No, we... we don't expect it.

970
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,450
We... we're just asking for it.

971
00:41:57,668 --> 00:41:58,957
No.

972
00:42:00,315 --> 00:42:02,044
You never asked for it.

973
00:42:04,341 --> 00:42:05,964
Copy that, boss.

974
00:42:09,246 --> 00:42:11,247
Okay, nothing to see here.

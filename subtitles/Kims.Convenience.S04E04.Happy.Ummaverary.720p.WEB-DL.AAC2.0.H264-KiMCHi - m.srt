1
00:00:02,273 --> 00:00:03,287
Hey, appa.

2
00:00:03,375 --> 00:00:06,092
- Hi, Janet. You come early.
- Yeah.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,023
Doesn't mean
you can leave early.

4
00:00:08,111 --> 00:00:09,648
Thanks.

5
00:00:11,632 --> 00:00:12,833
Did you ask?

6
00:00:13,093 --> 00:00:15,828
- What?
- If you can wear her shirt.

7
00:00:16,123 --> 00:00:17,529
You wearing umma's shirt.

8
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:19,765
- This is my shirt.
- Okay.

9
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,640
I bought it at Kensington
market, like, a month ago.

10
00:00:22,804 --> 00:00:25,412
And my style is anything
but<i> ajumma</i> style.

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,534
- What's<i> ajumma</i> style?
- You know...

12
00:00:28,999 --> 00:00:30,349
"oh!

13
00:00:30,921 --> 00:00:33,921
I don't wanna get
too dark sun tanning.

14
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:36,123
But in secret I am...

15
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,820
Darth Vader."

16
00:00:40,414 --> 00:00:42,129
Hi, Janet.
What you doing?

17
00:00:42,216 --> 00:00:43,875
Oh, I just came in from outside.

18
00:00:43,963 --> 00:00:46,367
Oh, good. Smart to cover up.

19
00:00:46,468 --> 00:00:49,082
- Don't want to get too dark
from sun tanning. - Hmm.

20
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,953
Huh! What you think
of Janet's shirt?

21
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:54,540
It's okay. Not really her style.

22
00:00:54,628 --> 00:00:56,599
It's a great shirt.
And not yours.

23
00:00:56,687 --> 00:01:00,804
Yeah. First mine,
then value village, now yours.

24
00:01:00,941 --> 00:01:01,948
You're making that up.

25
00:01:02,036 --> 00:01:03,773
Next time if you like my shirt,

26
00:01:03,945 --> 00:01:05,625
Tell to me before I donate.

27
00:01:05,773 --> 00:01:09,274
And just between us,
it look better on me.

28
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:11,836
Bye!

29
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,820
Ooh. Now you wearing
appa's style, huh?

30
00:01:16,908 --> 00:01:18,608
Oh, I don't mind.

31
00:01:40,991 --> 00:01:42,639
What happened to floor?

32
00:01:42,961 --> 00:01:44,732
Time takes toll on everything.

33
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,328
And someone scraped it
with a dolly.

34
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:48,929
Time takes toll.

35
00:01:49,121 --> 00:01:50,453
I have to see Mrs. Lee.

36
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:53,507
If you go to wholesale,
maybe you pick up some flower.

37
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:56,294
- Why?
- -because flower is pretty and nice.

38
00:01:56,382 --> 00:02:00,158
Make house bright
and remind us of good thing.

39
00:02:01,728 --> 00:02:03,445
Hint-hint...

40
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:04,734
The flowers?

41
00:02:04,822 --> 00:02:06,179
- For your anniversary?
- Oh...

42
00:02:06,267 --> 00:02:07,991
- You have to do something.
- I do something.

43
00:02:08,078 --> 00:02:09,950
I stay married for 28 year.

44
00:02:10,037 --> 00:02:10,943
- Appa...
- Janet,

45
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:14,688
When you get older, you learn
anniversary is just way

46
00:02:14,775 --> 00:02:16,740
For card company to make money,

47
00:02:16,828 --> 00:02:20,039
with flower company
and swan boat ride company.

48
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:21,662
- Big conspiracy.
- Whatever.

49
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,484
Eh, you think it's so important,
you do something.

50
00:02:24,572 --> 00:02:26,677
Actually, I was thinking

51
00:02:26,765 --> 00:02:30,070
Of hosting a surprise dinner
for you guys. At my place.

52
00:02:30,158 --> 00:02:31,614
You know how surprise work?

53
00:02:31,702 --> 00:02:33,630
But I thought I should
talk to you first

54
00:02:33,718 --> 00:02:36,031
Because I was gonna invite
the whole family.

55
00:02:36,203 --> 00:02:38,470
You, me, umma...

56
00:02:38,864 --> 00:02:40,196
And Jung.

57
00:02:41,757 --> 00:02:42,951
Yeah.

58
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:45,226
Because I know umma would
really like that.

59
00:02:45,314 --> 00:02:46,654
Probably.

60
00:02:46,742 --> 00:02:49,241
So would you be up for something
like that?

61
00:02:49,695 --> 00:02:50,711
Maybe.

62
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:54,304
But I don't think Jung would
come if he knows I'm coming.

63
00:02:54,578 --> 00:02:56,703
Jung has moved on.
You're the one who...

64
00:02:56,812 --> 00:02:58,131
- Who what?
- Nothing.

65
00:02:58,218 --> 00:02:59,666
I'm not the one
with the problem.

66
00:02:59,765 --> 00:03:01,468
Jung is usually
the one with the problem.

67
00:03:01,555 --> 00:03:03,437
Well, he has no problem
with this.

68
00:03:03,703 --> 00:03:05,812
Fine. Tell me when is dinner.

69
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,443
- Thursday works for Jung.
- Oh, yeah,

70
00:03:07,531 --> 00:03:09,625
I guess we just work around
Jung's schedule.

71
00:03:09,713 --> 00:03:11,335
Appa...

72
00:03:12,171 --> 00:03:13,639
- Okay.
- Great.

73
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:16,281
- And bring flowers.
- Why?

74
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,747
Hey, so you told me to pick up
pastries for tomorrow's meeting.

75
00:03:26,835 --> 00:03:28,888
- What are we thinking?
- Uh, pastries.

76
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:32,122
Got it. But, um, various,
shapes and sizes...

77
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,445
- Just have fun with it?
- Yeah,

78
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:36,117
This is so stressful.

79
00:03:36,843 --> 00:03:39,679
- Hey, Terence. Just arriving.
- Can't talk.

80
00:03:39,767 --> 00:03:40,997
There she is.

81
00:03:41,085 --> 00:03:43,609
Looking good, for a boss.
Or something more...

82
00:03:43,697 --> 00:03:44,875
Thanks.

83
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:48,315
But maybe don't lean
on my desk like that.

84
00:03:48,453 --> 00:03:50,255
- Too sexy?
- That, and it kinda blows

85
00:03:50,343 --> 00:03:52,752
the covert entrance
we're going for.

86
00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:54,195
We nailed that
so hard.

87
00:03:54,283 --> 00:03:56,500
Sure, just one small thing...

88
00:03:56,588 --> 00:03:58,692
Oh, I grabbed your coffee
when I got out of the car.

89
00:03:58,779 --> 00:03:59,802
Right.

90
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,443
And when you come in,
might be better

91
00:04:01,531 --> 00:04:03,216
to just be like,
"hi, good morning,"

92
00:04:03,304 --> 00:04:04,961
So it's like the first time
we're seeing each other.

93
00:04:05,048 --> 00:04:06,475
Gotcha.
And just so I know,

94
00:04:06,563 --> 00:04:09,484
How long are we planning on keeping
up the whole spy movie entrance thing?

95
00:04:09,572 --> 00:04:11,854
Uh, for as long as
we both work here?

96
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,906
But I could, like, tell
close friends, right?

97
00:04:13,994 --> 00:04:15,243
Just to be safe,
let's not tell anyone.

98
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,030
I just don't want anything
to change, you know?

99
00:04:17,117 --> 00:04:19,247
I just think that
if we approached this right

100
00:04:19,335 --> 00:04:22,192
And we come up with a game plan to
tell everyone, people might be into it.

101
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:24,992
Right. Yeah, but it's tricky
'cause I'm a woman in power,

102
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,704
Which means everyone is
just waiting to catch me out

103
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:29,445
So they can say I'm unfit
or emotionally unstable.

104
00:04:29,533 --> 00:04:31,601
- Yeah, makes sense.
- Which part?

105
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:34,250
- Um...
- Look, it won't always be like this.

106
00:04:34,338 --> 00:04:35,781
Well, unless we work
here forever.

107
00:04:35,869 --> 00:04:37,335
Exactly.

108
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,539
So, umma,

109
00:04:43,627 --> 00:04:45,382
Any big plans this week?

110
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:48,583
Yeah, going to superstore
with Mrs. Lee

111
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:51,843
And getting big box
of rice cracker I like so much.

112
00:04:51,931 --> 00:04:53,890
- And that's it?
- That's a lot.

113
00:04:53,978 --> 00:04:55,659
Superstore, rice cracker.

114
00:04:55,976 --> 00:04:58,187
Sometimes I think
you have add, Janet.

115
00:04:58,275 --> 00:05:00,195
It's just there's
something Thursday

116
00:05:00,283 --> 00:05:03,199
That I thought we could do
together that'd be fun.

117
00:05:03,287 --> 00:05:04,635
Oh, Janet. What?

118
00:05:04,723 --> 00:05:06,554
It's a photography exhibit
that I'm in.

119
00:05:06,642 --> 00:05:07,671
Oh.

120
00:05:07,758 --> 00:05:10,773
But I was thinking you can
come to my place beforehand,

121
00:05:10,861 --> 00:05:12,601
We could have drinks,
then go together.

122
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:15,038
Yeah, but I just go to
your photography show.

123
00:05:15,126 --> 00:05:17,828
Help you get award.
Best to go out on high note.

124
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,365
This is different.
It's my best work.

125
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,742
Very personal
and all about family.

126
00:05:22,845 --> 00:05:26,812
Maybe your appa want to go
this time. Or Jung. Or appa.

127
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,945
It's just they can't make it,
like, at all.

128
00:05:29,033 --> 00:05:31,617
So you'd be the only one
from the family

129
00:05:31,856 --> 00:05:35,382
That could come to this
really important exhibit

130
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,281
That's all about family.

131
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,387
- Okay.
- Great.

132
00:05:40,475 --> 00:05:42,190
It's gonna be really special.

133
00:05:42,278 --> 00:05:43,725
I have to think so.

134
00:05:44,404 --> 00:05:47,085
Otherwise we get depress.

135
00:05:47,173 --> 00:05:49,718
Jung Kim!
Where you been hiding?

136
00:05:49,806 --> 00:05:50,845
Sorry. Big date.

137
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,103
For two days?

138
00:05:52,191 --> 00:05:53,368
- It's busy season.
- Nice.

139
00:05:53,463 --> 00:05:55,931
And you know I'm all about
my boy livin' his best life,

140
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:59,102
But a "hey, bud,
don't wait up," wouldn't kill you.

141
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,107
- My bad.
- "my bad" accepted.

142
00:06:01,201 --> 00:06:04,892
Now dish. Have you met
the Hermione to your Ron yet?

143
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,173
A gentleman never tells.

144
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:08,565
Well, whoever these ladies are,
I'm impressed.

145
00:06:08,652 --> 00:06:11,681
And frankly, a little relieved
you dodged the Shannon bullet.

146
00:06:11,769 --> 00:06:13,284
Uh, yeah.

147
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:14,446
Swing-and-a-miss, bullet.

148
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,962
Don't get me wrong,
I loves the shannonigans...

149
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,126
For sure.

150
00:06:18,242 --> 00:06:20,904
I was just worried you'd get with
her as soon as Alejandro bounced.

151
00:06:20,993 --> 00:06:23,071
Well, he didn't bounce,
she dumped him.

152
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:24,208
Probably for a reason.

153
00:06:24,295 --> 00:06:26,321
But... yeah,
Shannon's so not my jam.

154
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:27,487
Plenty of fish, right?

155
00:06:27,575 --> 00:06:29,698
Aritzia girl.
Or keg waitress.

156
00:06:29,786 --> 00:06:30,516
Totally.

157
00:06:30,604 --> 00:06:32,789
Oh, my god,
are you dating keg waitress?

158
00:06:32,877 --> 00:06:35,549
Definitely not. And by the way,
she's a manager now.

159
00:06:35,637 --> 00:06:37,940
Oh. Good for keg waitress.

160
00:06:42,884 --> 00:06:47,869
Mr. Kim. At the risk
of being formal, how are you?

161
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:49,099
Okay.

162
00:06:49,186 --> 00:06:51,510
Have you ever heard
of a soft opening?

163
00:06:51,641 --> 00:06:53,448
- Like, new sex something?
- No.

164
00:06:53,536 --> 00:06:57,125
When a high-end restaurant
opens its doors to reviewers

165
00:06:57,213 --> 00:07:00,046
And influencers, before
the rabble ruins the place.

166
00:07:00,164 --> 00:07:01,737
- Free appetizer?
- And more.

167
00:07:01,825 --> 00:07:03,913
Open bar, cigar lounge.

168
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:07,080
Gorgeous servers,
and in this particular case, us.

169
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:09,185
Oh! You serious?

170
00:07:09,273 --> 00:07:12,291
Thursday. Seven o'clock.
The party begins.

171
00:07:12,424 --> 00:07:13,815
- Thursday?
- Save the date.

172
00:07:13,903 --> 00:07:15,010
Save date for what?

173
00:07:15,145 --> 00:07:17,784
An unforgettable evening
of gratuity.

174
00:07:17,872 --> 00:07:19,791
Shall I arrange an Uber Black?

175
00:07:19,905 --> 00:07:22,172
Yeah. It's just, uh...

176
00:07:22,573 --> 00:07:24,276
I have to work
at store Thursday.

177
00:07:24,364 --> 00:07:25,211
What?

178
00:07:25,299 --> 00:07:26,760
I can watch the store.

179
00:07:26,862 --> 00:07:29,455
Me and Janet can do
photography show other time.

180
00:07:29,543 --> 00:07:32,677
- Mrs. Kim with the glove save!
- Yeah.

181
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,924
- No.
- Why? What's problem?

182
00:07:35,012 --> 00:07:37,580
I have to... Wax store floor.

183
00:07:37,668 --> 00:07:41,218
You know, because of a scratch
and time take a toll...

184
00:07:41,372 --> 00:07:43,768
Wax another day.
Moscow mules await.

185
00:07:43,856 --> 00:07:45,979
No. Have to wax the floor.

186
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,010
And you have to go
to Janet photography show.

187
00:07:49,246 --> 00:07:51,628
Well, you're a better man
than I,

188
00:07:51,746 --> 00:07:54,380
And a better father
than a friend, that's for sure.

189
00:08:04,198 --> 00:08:07,096
- Good morning, Shannon.
- Maybe don't sit next to me.

190
00:08:07,584 --> 00:08:09,417
Right.
Wasn't going to.

191
00:08:13,768 --> 00:08:17,054
Well, guess I'll just have
a seat next to the boss.

192
00:08:17,141 --> 00:08:20,018
Thanks a lot, guys.

193
00:08:20,134 --> 00:08:21,971
Oh, good morning, Shannon.

194
00:08:22,088 --> 00:08:23,360
So, I'll keep this short.

195
00:08:23,447 --> 00:08:26,541
The head office is rolling out
a new initiative called,

196
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:27,875
"go the extra mile."

197
00:08:27,963 --> 00:08:31,201
Will there be an exam? I don't want this
coming out of nowhere, like the pastries.

198
00:08:31,288 --> 00:08:32,869
You had a week, Terence.

199
00:08:32,956 --> 00:08:34,416
Anyway, it's a new program

200
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,773
designed to make
our customers feel heard...

201
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,061
Oh, you got
a little something there.

202
00:08:43,493 --> 00:08:47,338
And you, Kimchee, have something
on the sides of your head.

203
00:08:47,603 --> 00:08:48,817
Your earlobes.

204
00:08:49,005 --> 00:08:51,713
Let me just dust
those off for you.

205
00:08:51,815 --> 00:08:54,760
And you, sir,
with that big old neck.

206
00:08:54,848 --> 00:08:57,054
Like the Eiffel tower.

207
00:08:57,142 --> 00:08:58,724
Or la tour on.

208
00:08:59,049 --> 00:09:03,477
And Mr. Fuzzy sideburns here.
Wolf man. Love it.

209
00:09:03,565 --> 00:09:06,315
- And, Stacie, these shoulders...
- No.

210
00:09:06,403 --> 00:09:08,170
Right.

211
00:09:08,854 --> 00:09:09,940
Where was I?

212
00:09:10,027 --> 00:09:11,742
Uh, the point Shannon's
trying to make

213
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:14,244
Is we're all about
better customer service.

214
00:09:14,331 --> 00:09:15,797
- Exactly.
- So, just to be clear,

215
00:09:15,885 --> 00:09:19,674
Is it no to touching customers
or yes to touching customers?

216
00:09:24,151 --> 00:09:26,205
Hey. Nice cover at the meeting.

217
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,776
Are you kidding? I touched
everyone's face like a pervert.

218
00:09:28,877 --> 00:09:30,039
You're being paranoid.

219
00:09:30,127 --> 00:09:33,604
Stacie just said hi to me.
Hi from Stacie?

220
00:09:33,692 --> 00:09:34,813
And Kimchee knows for sure.

221
00:09:34,901 --> 00:09:37,393
Nah, trust me. He told me
I dodged a bullet

222
00:09:37,481 --> 00:09:39,029
Not getting involved with you.

223
00:09:39,588 --> 00:09:43,041
Really? A bullet?
Like, dating me would kill you?

224
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:44,119
Yeah! So he's the last guy

225
00:09:44,207 --> 00:09:45,689
That's gonna suspect
we're together.

226
00:09:45,777 --> 00:09:47,432
But what did he mean
by dodge a bullet?

227
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,751
Nothing. That's positive.

228
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,414
You dodge a bullet, and you're alive.
It's a good thing.

229
00:09:51,502 --> 00:09:53,578
Not if you're the bullet
that people need to dodge.

230
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:56,149
He meant more like it would
ruin our work dynamic.

231
00:09:56,237 --> 00:09:59,369
You know, how you were saying that
how women bosses are crazy and stuff?

232
00:09:59,457 --> 00:10:01,627
- What?
- Who cares what he thinks.

233
00:10:01,715 --> 00:10:03,602
You're a bullet
I'm happy to take.

234
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,166
And the point is,
your secret is safe.

235
00:10:06,254 --> 00:10:08,346
- Our secret.
- Hi, guys.

236
00:10:08,656 --> 00:10:10,510
Stacie, hey.

237
00:10:10,674 --> 00:10:12,784
That was a totally normal,
"hi, guys," right?

238
00:10:12,872 --> 00:10:15,877
It was until you said that.

239
00:10:24,763 --> 00:10:26,612
What is this?

240
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,172
Wax buff machine.

241
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:33,002
Mr. Addy is a janitor,
he get for us for free.

242
00:10:33,603 --> 00:10:35,096
Oh, that's a nice shirt.

243
00:10:35,212 --> 00:10:37,741
Yeah, want to look good
for customer.

244
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:41,964
Might get dirty.
Not my favorite shirt, so maybe okay.

245
00:10:42,052 --> 00:10:44,198
Oi, what you doing?

246
00:10:44,286 --> 00:10:45,202
Help.

247
00:10:45,289 --> 00:10:48,799
But you have to go
to photography show with Janet.

248
00:10:48,887 --> 00:10:49,926
Most important.

249
00:10:50,014 --> 00:10:52,095
There's lots of time for that.

250
00:10:52,183 --> 00:10:53,721
The sooner we start,

251
00:10:53,967 --> 00:10:55,289
The sooner you can finish.

252
00:10:55,377 --> 00:10:59,401
Yeah, but once I start,
I can't stop until finish.

253
00:10:59,489 --> 00:11:00,821
Yeah.

254
00:11:06,643 --> 00:11:08,385
- <i>Hi, Anjali.</i>
- Young-mi!

255
00:11:08,473 --> 00:11:10,328
Great news!
Sanjiv hurt his back!

256
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:13,229
Oh, yay, that's good news.
Thanks for calling.

257
00:11:13,317 --> 00:11:14,393
Best to Sanjiv.

258
00:11:14,481 --> 00:11:15,295
Keep going.

259
00:11:15,524 --> 00:11:16,665
<i>He gave me his tickets</i>

260
00:11:16,753 --> 00:11:18,479
<i>To a swanky restaurant
opening tonight.</i>

261
00:11:18,567 --> 00:11:19,372
Oh.

262
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:22,034
<i>Cocktails,
champagne, the works!</i>

263
00:11:22,122 --> 00:11:23,602
You'll be my plus one.

264
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,442
Yeah, yeah, I might have time
for quick drink.

265
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:28,145
<i>I'm leaving now.
I'll text you the details.</i>

266
00:11:28,232 --> 00:11:29,479
Okay.

267
00:11:29,566 --> 00:11:31,193
Okay...

268
00:11:31,347 --> 00:11:33,963
Have to go. See you.

269
00:11:34,051 --> 00:11:35,401
- Going now?
- Yeah.

270
00:11:35,489 --> 00:11:37,155
Bye.

271
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,037
Hello!

272
00:11:57,192 --> 00:11:58,807
Hi.

273
00:11:59,496 --> 00:12:01,294
- Where's your umma?
- She's late.

274
00:12:01,382 --> 00:12:02,583
Like you.

275
00:12:02,671 --> 00:12:03,912
Ah.

276
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,599
I bring gift for you and Jung.

277
00:12:06,687 --> 00:12:08,584
You used to love as a kid, huh?

278
00:12:08,672 --> 00:12:10,630
Uh, mostly Jung.
Was his favorite.

279
00:12:10,718 --> 00:12:13,000
See, I not the problem.

280
00:12:13,377 --> 00:12:16,960
"Thank you, appa.
So kind, so thoughtful."

281
00:12:17,047 --> 00:12:18,644
- Where are the flowers?
- What flower?

282
00:12:18,732 --> 00:12:20,847
Oh, my god, I reminded
you, like, three times.

283
00:12:20,935 --> 00:12:24,434
But I bring cookie, and you don't
even remind me one time, huh?

284
00:12:24,521 --> 00:12:26,240
- Where's Jung?
- He's not here yet.

285
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:29,177
Ha! See?

286
00:12:29,265 --> 00:12:31,247
It's umma! Hide!

287
00:12:31,528 --> 00:12:32,994
Why?

288
00:12:34,965 --> 00:12:37,825
- Surprise!
- Hey. When does this start again?

289
00:12:37,934 --> 00:12:39,965
Twenty minutes ago.

290
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,064
- Where's the wine?
- Oh.

291
00:12:42,152 --> 00:12:43,184
I'll be right back.

292
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,190
- Seriously?
- Sorry, I got a lot going on.

293
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:48,745
It's okay, Jung, we forgive you
for being late and forgetting wine.

294
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,561
No, we don't. And you both
came late and empty-handed.

295
00:12:51,648 --> 00:12:54,840
Not empty hand.
And Jung little more late than me.

296
00:12:54,928 --> 00:12:56,532
But not bother me.

297
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:59,395
- Hey, appa.
- I was waxing.

298
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,908
A little manscaping.
I hear ya.

299
00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:05,488
Oh, I bring this
for you and Janet.

300
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,910
Oh. Uh, thanks.

301
00:13:07,998 --> 00:13:10,231
Hmm. Not a problem.

302
00:13:12,567 --> 00:13:15,528
- Hey, Kim-cheese.
- What's-a-happenin'?

303
00:13:15,684 --> 00:13:18,270
Just ordering the new
"going the extra mile" signage.

304
00:13:18,358 --> 00:13:19,839
What's-a-happenin' with you?

305
00:13:19,976 --> 00:13:21,284
Oh, the uje. Working.

306
00:13:21,372 --> 00:13:23,456
Then on the personal side,

307
00:13:23,544 --> 00:13:26,278
I'm just living that single life.
Livin' it large.

308
00:13:26,366 --> 00:13:27,715
Hells yeah.

309
00:13:27,803 --> 00:13:29,450
You got anything
exciting on tonight?

310
00:13:29,538 --> 00:13:30,367
Nah.

311
00:13:30,454 --> 00:13:34,012
Honestly, I'm still processing
the big break-up with Alejandro.

312
00:13:34,473 --> 00:13:37,416
Feels like I really dodged
a bullet with that one. Right?

313
00:13:37,527 --> 00:13:39,276
I don't know
if you dodged a bullet.

314
00:13:39,363 --> 00:13:40,627
You dated him for two years.

315
00:13:40,715 --> 00:13:43,446
Sure, but what went wrong?
Was it me?

316
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:45,614
Am I a someone who's bad
to date for some reason?

317
00:13:45,702 --> 00:13:47,231
No. You're amazing.

318
00:13:47,371 --> 00:13:48,926
Any guy'd be lucky
to be with you.

319
00:13:49,014 --> 00:13:51,776
So if I was, say,
fired from a gun,

320
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:54,090
You don't think there's anyone
who should get out of the way?

321
00:13:54,177 --> 00:13:55,806
Uh... Maybe everyone.

322
00:13:55,894 --> 00:13:58,222
Why did you tell Jung that he
dodged a bullet by not dating me?

323
00:13:58,309 --> 00:14:02,198
Oh. Yeah... That's not about
you being a bad person.

324
00:14:02,286 --> 00:14:03,809
It doesn't feel like
a compliment.

325
00:14:03,897 --> 00:14:06,079
I like you,
I like Jung.

326
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:07,928
But you're a serial monogamist,

327
00:14:08,016 --> 00:14:10,924
And Jung is a serial...
The opposite of that.

328
00:14:11,012 --> 00:14:13,606
I just think there's potential
for you both getting hurt.

329
00:14:13,694 --> 00:14:15,151
Aww, that's sweet.

330
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:17,879
Then I'd always have to be choosing
between my boss and my boy,

331
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:19,786
And it'd be stressful for me
here and at home,

332
00:14:19,874 --> 00:14:21,989
And it'd just...
Kinda suck for me.

333
00:14:22,077 --> 00:14:23,270
Maybe sweet's the wrong word.

334
00:14:23,358 --> 00:14:25,992
Wait, why did Jung
tell you that?

335
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,387
Oh!

336
00:14:27,475 --> 00:14:28,956
You guys are dating?

337
00:14:29,044 --> 00:14:30,051
Oh!

338
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:32,421
Yo! That's so great.
Congratulations!

339
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:34,524
Thanks. But we're trying
to keep it on the d-l.

340
00:14:34,612 --> 00:14:36,333
Right, 'cause if it blows up,

341
00:14:36,473 --> 00:14:38,502
It won't be a big,
embarrassing thing for you guys.

342
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,503
- No, that...
- That's not it at all.

343
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,770
Okay. Then why are you
keeping it a secret?

344
00:14:42,858 --> 00:14:44,858
Hey, guys.

345
00:14:45,724 --> 00:14:47,004
Was that kinda weird?

346
00:14:47,092 --> 00:14:49,726
Yes. You hear it, too.

347
00:14:56,606 --> 00:14:58,506
Thank you.

348
00:14:58,594 --> 00:14:59,817
Oh.

349
00:14:59,945 --> 00:15:03,895
So fancy.
And a real towel.

350
00:15:03,983 --> 00:15:05,431
Those actually stay here.

351
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,953
Oh. Yeah.

352
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:13,169
Janet? Oh, no,
I lose track of time.

353
00:15:13,256 --> 00:15:15,372
<i>Sorry, I missed
your photography show.</i>

354
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:16,673
No, you didn't miss it.
There's still time.

355
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,242
Just come to my place now,
and we'll go together.

356
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:22,479
Oh, but Mrs. Mehta
is still dancing.

357
00:15:22,566 --> 00:15:24,012
Where is she?
Maybe we go meet.

358
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,559
No, I prepared all this.

359
00:15:25,647 --> 00:15:27,128
You got a quiche from Sobeys.

360
00:15:27,216 --> 00:15:28,798
- <i>Janet?</i>
- Mmm-hmm.

361
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,500
Oh, I love this song.

362
00:15:30,588 --> 00:15:32,003
<i>Umma, are you coming?</i>

363
00:15:32,091 --> 00:15:33,122
Yeah, yeah, I leave now.

364
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:36,044
Right after I finish
this sex on the beach.

365
00:15:36,246 --> 00:15:37,678
Ooh.

366
00:15:47,824 --> 00:15:49,606
Yeah, I'm actually
gonna take off.

367
00:15:49,694 --> 00:15:51,909
You can't.
This is important to umma.

368
00:15:51,997 --> 00:15:53,028
Obviously not.

369
00:15:53,116 --> 00:15:54,142
Where do you have to be anyway?

370
00:15:54,229 --> 00:15:56,659
Let him go. You plan not work.
We do this other time.

371
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:57,727
There is no other time.

372
00:15:57,815 --> 00:15:58,946
If you want to go, go.

373
00:15:59,034 --> 00:16:01,932
It's just a wedding
anniversary, nothing special.

374
00:16:02,172 --> 00:16:03,720
What's that supposed to mean?

375
00:16:04,369 --> 00:16:07,025
- Okay, let's not get all... - I don't
think you understand what I talking.

376
00:16:07,112 --> 00:16:09,268
I think I understand exactly
what you talking.

377
00:16:09,356 --> 00:16:10,486
Maybe we should have
the cookies now.

378
00:16:10,573 --> 00:16:12,863
- What's your problem? - I don't have
a problem. You brought it up first.

379
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:13,829
Please, let's not get into it.

380
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:16,190
What I bring up?
Tell to me what I bring up!

381
00:16:16,278 --> 00:16:17,136
Stop it!

382
00:16:17,224 --> 00:16:18,909
This isn't about you.
Or you!

383
00:16:18,997 --> 00:16:20,073
It's my anniversary.

384
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,229
Dad, you and umma
never celebrate.

385
00:16:22,317 --> 00:16:24,041
That's what
he was talking about.

386
00:16:24,194 --> 00:16:26,276
He didn't think you didn't think
it was special.

387
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,494
He and umma don't think
it's special.

388
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,635
But I do.

389
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,588
And I thought maybe it was worth
celebrating, with all of us.

390
00:16:34,676 --> 00:16:36,627
But if you wanna leave, leave!

391
00:16:36,908 --> 00:16:39,869
And we can forget about this
stupid party that no one wants!

392
00:16:40,814 --> 00:16:43,062
Knock, knock. Hello?

393
00:16:43,446 --> 00:16:45,791
Janet! I'm here.

394
00:16:45,925 --> 00:16:49,229
Oh, thanks to so dangerous taxi.

395
00:16:49,317 --> 00:16:50,599
Jung? Appa?

396
00:16:51,031 --> 00:16:52,479
Why you both are here?
Something wrong?

397
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:54,581
No, we're here because of you.

398
00:16:54,669 --> 00:16:55,901
For a surprise party.

399
00:16:55,989 --> 00:16:58,651
So... Surprise.

400
00:16:58,843 --> 00:17:00,825
Yeah, surprise.

401
00:17:01,085 --> 00:17:03,119
Surprise from me too.

402
00:17:03,685 --> 00:17:05,284
For your anniversary.

403
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,112
All of you organize this?

404
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,156
Yeah.

405
00:17:13,244 --> 00:17:15,612
- I organized it!
- I bought wine.

406
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,182
I mean I forgot it, but...

407
00:17:17,281 --> 00:17:19,893
And I bring flower. Next time.

408
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:22,619
So you do all this?

409
00:17:22,752 --> 00:17:25,668
Well, I got the food,
made some snacks,

410
00:17:25,755 --> 00:17:27,070
Did the decorations,

411
00:17:27,157 --> 00:17:28,605
Bought the baguette you like
from the french bakery...

412
00:17:28,692 --> 00:17:31,441
Okay, okay,
we all say thank you, Janet.

413
00:17:31,528 --> 00:17:33,443
- Did you?
- Oh, don't pick fight, Janet.

414
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:36,312
We all here.
That's most important thing.

415
00:17:36,399 --> 00:17:37,948
What?

416
00:17:39,353 --> 00:17:42,955
Well... Shall we sit?

417
00:17:43,494 --> 00:17:45,455
- Mmm.
- Yeah, okay.

418
00:17:47,015 --> 00:17:49,530
- Something burning?
- Oh, my god!

419
00:17:49,641 --> 00:17:52,385
Dunzo. Nothing like
an end of day trunk lunk.

420
00:17:52,473 --> 00:17:54,922
You've a smudge of something
on your face.

421
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:58,268
Let me go
the extra mile for you.

422
00:17:59,723 --> 00:18:03,258
Did you guys notice how long Shannon
kept her hand on me at the meeting?

423
00:18:03,346 --> 00:18:06,617
But clearly the biggest connection
was between her and Jung.

424
00:18:06,705 --> 00:18:09,440
There's a little
somethin'-somethin' goin' on.

425
00:18:09,528 --> 00:18:11,844
Okay. I would like
to say somethin'

426
00:18:11,932 --> 00:18:13,524
About that little
somethin'-somethin'.

427
00:18:13,612 --> 00:18:16,705
Yeah. Uh, Shannon would never do
something as unprofessional

428
00:18:16,793 --> 00:18:18,078
As date someone on staff.

429
00:18:18,174 --> 00:18:20,674
That was a totally normal,
professional face wipe.

430
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,188
I thought the sideburn rub
was pretty professional.

431
00:18:23,276 --> 00:18:26,549
And I didn't mean to react
harshly to your shoulder touch,

432
00:18:26,637 --> 00:18:27,484
I'm just shy.

433
00:18:27,572 --> 00:18:29,642
Trying to be friendlier,
say hi more.

434
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:30,838
Right.

435
00:18:30,949 --> 00:18:32,845
And really,
when you think about it,

436
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:34,892
Is it so wrong
to date someone at work?

437
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,048
I'm so glad you said that.

438
00:18:36,136 --> 00:18:37,418
How do you feel
about dancing horses?

439
00:18:37,505 --> 00:18:39,798
Because I have two tickets
to see Cavalia.

440
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:41,400
No, Omar, I...

441
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:43,017
Thank you, but no.

442
00:18:43,229 --> 00:18:46,612
What I'm saying is Jung and
I are in a relationship.

443
00:18:46,868 --> 00:18:50,501
- Oh. - And it's an amazing
relationship. Very strong.

444
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:52,751
I have a great feeling
about how long it's gonna last.

445
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:56,874
- You're overdoing it.
- Maybe I'm just more confident.

446
00:18:56,962 --> 00:18:58,642
Well, anyway, now you know.

447
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,361
I know we only have
a few minutes left,

448
00:19:00,449 --> 00:19:02,017
But let's make then count.

449
00:19:03,631 --> 00:19:06,306
Stacie, do you like
horse-dance theater?

450
00:19:06,394 --> 00:19:09,128
Can I have both tickets?

451
00:19:13,094 --> 00:19:15,378
Hope it wasn't too overcooked.

452
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,781
No. Just enough overcook.

453
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:25,087
I know it's not easy for
everybody to come. Or to cook.

454
00:19:25,657 --> 00:19:29,939
But this is first time
we all eat together in 15 year.

455
00:19:32,429 --> 00:19:35,103
Sorry, just so touched.

456
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,681
And tipsy.

457
00:19:37,464 --> 00:19:39,513
- Doesn't make less special.
- Mmm.

458
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,173
Well, you and appa deserve it.

459
00:19:41,329 --> 00:19:45,134
Because of you two getting
together, we're all here.

460
00:19:51,587 --> 00:19:54,067
We go.
Look like Jung is leaving.

461
00:19:54,155 --> 00:19:56,962
Actually, I was
just grabbing these.

462
00:19:57,153 --> 00:19:58,704
We haven't had dessert yet.

463
00:19:59,868 --> 00:20:02,101
Oh, yeah.

464
00:20:04,143 --> 00:20:05,689
- Okay. Thank you.
- Mmm.

465
00:20:05,777 --> 00:20:07,743
Yeah.

466
00:20:08,368 --> 00:20:10,101
Ah.

467
00:20:14,057 --> 00:20:14,804
Hmm.

468
00:20:15,062 --> 00:20:16,844
What's the expiry date on these?

469
00:20:16,932 --> 00:20:19,099
Janet,
don't be the problem.

470
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:24,642
Got him.

471
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,040
Hey, how was dinner?

472
00:20:26,227 --> 00:20:29,296
Uh, good. A little burnt,
and calories per portion were high, but...

473
00:20:29,384 --> 00:20:30,896
I meant having dinner
with the family.

474
00:20:30,984 --> 00:20:37,308
Oh. Uh, not sure.
Not great, but... Not terrible.

475
00:20:37,633 --> 00:20:39,718
- Did you order another pizza?
- No.

476
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,045
- Hey.
- Hey, Kimch,

477
00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:44,945
It's our boss Shannon from work.

478
00:20:45,033 --> 00:20:46,312
Come in, come in.

479
00:20:46,681 --> 00:20:48,741
- You remember Kimch.
- Everyone knows, buddy.

480
00:20:48,829 --> 00:20:51,411
- Yeah...
- Really? That's great.

481
00:20:51,499 --> 00:20:53,933
- That's great, right?
- Yes.

482
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,562
I really wanted to tell you.

483
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,155
It's okay, Shannon filled me in.

484
00:20:57,243 --> 00:20:58,991
I thought maybe
we could grab a drink.

485
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:00,588
Yeah, I got some beers here.

486
00:21:00,684 --> 00:21:03,700
Yeah, yeah.
We could drink in this apartment.

487
00:21:03,912 --> 00:21:05,312
Grand.

488
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,820
Guys, Gwen's coming over,

489
00:21:06,908 --> 00:21:08,823
So I was hoping
to have the place to myself.

490
00:21:08,911 --> 00:21:11,976
Oh, right. We could go out,
grab a drink.

491
00:21:12,064 --> 00:21:13,570
Thank you.

492
00:21:15,081 --> 00:21:19,179
Or better yet, we could grab
some beers and hit the park.

493
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,384
I can only do so much.

1
00:00:03,776 --> 00:00:05,109
Alan.

2
00:00:05,917 --> 00:00:06,999
Hurry up.

3
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:08,567
The girls are almost here,
and I'm a...

4
00:00:08,569 --> 00:00:11,837
* Hunka hunka rotting love. *

5
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:14,056
Sorry, just
finishing up my costume.

6
00:00:20,181 --> 00:00:22,181
Who the hell are
you supposed to be?

7
00:00:22,183 --> 00:00:24,149
You never saw<i> Pretty in Pink?</i>

8
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:27,019
Oh, right!
You're Molly Ringwald.

9
00:00:27,021 --> 00:00:28,654
Ha-ha. I-I'm Duckie.

10
00:00:28,656 --> 00:00:31,323
You know, the-the best friend,
the-the scene stealer?

11
00:00:31,325 --> 00:00:34,693
Some would say
the true star of the film.

12
00:00:34,695 --> 00:00:36,529
Who played him, Boy George?

13
00:00:38,165 --> 00:00:41,083
Hey, what do you think
about zombie Elvis, baby?

14
00:00:41,085 --> 00:00:43,118
And don't be cruel.

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,620
It's great.

16
00:00:44,622 --> 00:00:46,622
You look like both
the impersonator at my wedding

17
00:00:46,624 --> 00:00:48,290
and my ex-wife.

18
00:00:49,594 --> 00:00:50,960
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

19
00:00:50,962 --> 00:00:54,630
What decays in Vegas
stays in Vegas.

20
00:00:54,632 --> 00:00:56,632
Oh, hey, uh, did your
friend Stacy say anything

21
00:00:56,634 --> 00:00:58,050
bout the girl she's
bringing for me?

22
00:00:58,052 --> 00:00:59,802
Uh, just that she's supposed
to be really cute,

23
00:00:59,804 --> 00:01:01,670
and she just moved out here
after a tough breakup.

24
00:01:01,672 --> 00:01:03,622
Ooh, hot, lonely
and damaged.

25
00:01:03,624 --> 00:01:05,507
Duckie's getting lucky.

26
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,394
You know, if Duckie
really wants to get lucky,

27
00:01:08,396 --> 00:01:11,063
he'll tell the girls that he's
someone that people remember.

28
00:01:11,065 --> 00:01:12,698
Like Ferris Bueller.

29
00:01:14,569 --> 00:01:17,152
Fine, you win again, Broderick.

30
00:01:17,154 --> 00:01:19,188
God, you know what
I love about Halloween?

31
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:21,440
You can put "slutty"
in front of any job position,

32
00:01:21,442 --> 00:01:23,409
and it becomes a costume.

33
00:01:23,411 --> 00:01:26,362
Slutty nurse, slutty librarian,
slutty lunch lady.

34
00:01:27,999 --> 00:01:29,949
Hey, you didn't know
Mrs. Goobadeck

35
00:01:29,951 --> 00:01:32,701
from Mark Twain Elementary.

36
00:01:32,703 --> 00:01:34,954
She rocked that hairnet.

37
00:01:34,956 --> 00:01:36,538
My chest.

38
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,040
Seriously?
W-What's going on?

39
00:01:38,042 --> 00:01:40,009
I don't know, I can't breathe,
my chest is tight.

40
00:01:40,011 --> 00:01:41,011
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

41
00:01:41,012 --> 00:01:42,127
Here, here. Sit down.

42
00:01:42,129 --> 00:01:44,597
Um... Oh. Uh, well,
uh, don't worry.

43
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:46,799
I-I'm sure this is
nothing, but, uh...

44
00:01:46,801 --> 00:01:50,552
I'm going to call an ambulance,
just in case.

45
00:01:50,554 --> 00:01:51,887
Just, uh, just stay calm.

46
00:01:51,889 --> 00:01:53,105
You're gonna be fine.

47
00:01:53,107 --> 00:01:55,891
Help! My friend is dying!

48
00:01:55,893 --> 00:01:58,193
I can't settle down, I think
he's having a heart attack.

49
00:01:58,195 --> 00:01:59,895
Oh, my God, I'm having
a heart attack.

50
00:01:59,897 --> 00:02:01,313
Oh. No, no.

51
00:02:01,315 --> 00:02:03,232
I-I'm just saying that
to get them to hurry.

52
00:02:03,234 --> 00:02:04,366
I'm not just saying that.

53
00:02:04,368 --> 00:02:05,534
I think he's headed
toward the light.

54
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:07,903
I can't feel my left arm.

55
00:02:07,905 --> 00:02:09,371
Um, uh, you're gonna be okay.

56
00:02:09,373 --> 00:02:11,573
It's probably just gas.
Try to fart!

57
00:02:13,244 --> 00:02:14,209
Trick...

58
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:15,661
Or treat.

59
00:02:15,663 --> 00:02:18,080
Oh, ladies. I'm sorry, you just
got here during a bit of a...

60
00:02:18,082 --> 00:02:19,415
Ooh, I can see
your nipples, officer.

61
00:02:19,417 --> 00:02:23,669
Anything you see will
be held against you.

62
00:02:24,588 --> 00:02:26,305
And I'm Harry Potter.

63
00:02:26,307 --> 00:02:28,257
But I'm not so hairy.

64
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:29,558
She's mine.

65
00:02:34,765 --> 00:02:37,349
Didn't work!

66
00:02:37,373 --> 00:02:41,373

68
00:02:52,492 --> 00:02:54,203
Don't worry, we're
almost to the hospital.

69
00:02:54,204 --> 00:02:55,787
Sir, are you taking
any medications?

70
00:02:55,789 --> 00:02:58,457
Well, I take a generic Lipitor
and a women's multi-vitamin.

71
00:02:59,676 --> 00:03:01,343
I mean, just so you know,
I take the women's

72
00:03:01,345 --> 00:03:02,544
'cause it has more iron.

73
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,097
Same price, more iron.

74
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:06,298
Yes, please.

75
00:03:07,668 --> 00:03:08,767
Is he gonna be okay?

76
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:10,018
We're doing
all we can, sir.

77
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,720
I can't believe this is
happening, you know?

78
00:03:11,722 --> 00:03:12,854
He's so young!

79
00:03:12,856 --> 00:03:14,606
He leads such
a healthy lifestyle...

80
00:03:14,608 --> 00:03:16,057
Well, except for all the pot.

81
00:03:18,061 --> 00:03:19,277
You know, the-the weed.

82
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:20,645
The... the ganja.

83
00:03:21,565 --> 00:03:24,199
The ol' Mexican spinach.

84
00:03:24,201 --> 00:03:28,069
Alan, if I live,
I'm going to kill you.

85
00:03:28,071 --> 00:03:30,238
Stop it. You are gonna live.

86
00:03:31,575 --> 00:03:32,741
Is he gonna live?

87
00:03:32,743 --> 00:03:34,993
We're en route
with a 35-year-old male.

88
00:03:34,995 --> 00:03:37,913
BP is 160/94, pulse is 108.

89
00:03:37,915 --> 00:03:40,365
And he's dressed
as zombie Elvis, over!

90
00:03:41,385 --> 00:03:43,752
I-I don't know if you guys
need to know that.

91
00:03:43,754 --> 00:03:44,769
They don't.

92
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,707
By the way, uh,
I'm dressed as...

93
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:49,875
Ferris Bueller?

94
00:03:51,762 --> 00:03:54,513
Hey, hey, at least I took
a chance with my costume.

95
00:03:54,515 --> 00:03:56,565
I mean, Elvis and zombies.

96
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:57,599
It's real original.

97
00:03:57,601 --> 00:03:59,601
Next year, it's vampire Obama.

98
00:03:59,603 --> 00:04:02,187
"Yes, we can!"

99
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:05,440
Excuse me, do you have
anything for the pain?

100
00:04:05,442 --> 00:04:07,993
In my ass?

101
00:04:07,995 --> 00:04:09,361
I know, I know.

102
00:04:09,363 --> 00:04:11,696
I'm just... I'm freaking out
because I'm worried.

103
00:04:11,698 --> 00:04:13,165
I mean, you are my best friend.

104
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:14,916
And if something were
to happen to you,

105
00:04:14,918 --> 00:04:16,284
I don't know what I would do.

106
00:04:16,286 --> 00:04:17,869
I mean, I-I've already
lost a brother.

107
00:04:17,871 --> 00:04:20,255
I can't lose
you, too!

108
00:04:20,257 --> 00:04:21,873
A-And you're more
of a brother than he was.

109
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,675
And now Jake's in the Army,
and I'm all alone.

110
00:04:23,677 --> 00:04:25,210
And I don't do well
when I'm alone...

111
00:04:25,212 --> 00:04:26,378
Here, breathe.

112
00:04:28,515 --> 00:04:31,016
Thank you.

113
00:04:32,269 --> 00:04:35,687
Am I crazy, or is, uh,
something happening here?

114
00:04:39,109 --> 00:04:41,393
*<i> Men.</i> *

115
00:04:46,316 --> 00:04:47,816
Oh, good, uh, you made it.

116
00:04:47,818 --> 00:04:49,734
Uh... Oh, I-I'm sorry I pulled
you out of your Halloween party,

117
00:04:49,736 --> 00:04:50,652
I just figured you'd want to...

118
00:04:50,654 --> 00:04:53,205
I wasn't at a Halloween party.

119
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,074
I-I just assumed,
since you're dressed...

120
00:04:56,076 --> 00:04:57,409
So what happened?

121
00:04:57,411 --> 00:04:59,044
I don't know.

122
00:04:59,046 --> 00:05:00,212
We were about to go out,

123
00:05:00,214 --> 00:05:02,547
and he got chest pains
and suddenly collapsed.

124
00:05:02,549 --> 00:05:04,332
Oh, wow.

125
00:05:04,334 --> 00:05:06,167
He's so young.

126
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:07,502
So fit.

127
00:05:07,504 --> 00:05:09,521
So not you.

128
00:05:10,941 --> 00:05:14,059
Hope he's okay.

129
00:05:14,061 --> 00:05:17,896
I never thought I'd have a boss
better than your brother,

130
00:05:17,898 --> 00:05:19,931
but Walden is good people.

131
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:21,733
He's the best.

132
00:05:21,735 --> 00:05:24,936
The guy has the biggest heart
of anyone I have ever met.

133
00:05:24,938 --> 00:05:26,888
Yep, a heart of gold.

134
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:29,591
Clogged with arterial plaque.

135
00:05:29,593 --> 00:05:31,593
You've been a good
friend to Walden.

136
00:05:31,595 --> 00:05:32,861
He's lucky
to have you.

137
00:05:32,863 --> 00:05:36,865
He's lucky to have you,
too, Sister Berta.

138
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:38,867
And, listen, um...

139
00:05:38,869 --> 00:05:42,420
if, God forbid,
the worst happens,

140
00:05:42,422 --> 00:05:44,539
I-I just want you
to know that, uh...

141
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:47,375
you'll always have
a job at the house.

142
00:05:47,377 --> 00:05:50,378
I mean, we'd have to talk
reduced salaries, but, uh...

143
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,764
What makes you think
he'd leave you the house?

144
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:54,366
I'm his best friend.

145
00:05:54,368 --> 00:05:56,017
There's nobody closer
to him than me.

146
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:57,435
I clean his underwear.

147
00:05:57,437 --> 00:05:58,970
I<i> wear</i> his underwear.

148
00:06:00,557 --> 00:06:02,274
Alan Harper?

149
00:06:02,276 --> 00:06:04,059
Oh, oh, that's me.

150
00:06:04,061 --> 00:06:05,727
I'm Dr. Prajneep.

151
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:07,562
Your friend had a
mild heart attack.

152
00:06:07,564 --> 00:06:09,481
We put in a stent to
clear the blockage.

153
00:06:09,483 --> 00:06:10,332
Is that bad?

154
00:06:10,334 --> 00:06:11,750
In general,

155
00:06:11,752 --> 00:06:13,234
a heart attack is bad.

156
00:06:13,236 --> 00:06:15,453
But, uh, he should
make a full recovery.

157
00:06:15,455 --> 00:06:16,655
Oh, thank God.

158
00:06:16,657 --> 00:06:17,989
Oh, that is
a huge relief.

159
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:19,908
Um, is there anything
we should do at home?

160
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,577
I just want to make sure
he has all the care he needs.

161
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:24,913
Uh, any special diet,
exercises, medications?

162
00:06:24,915 --> 00:06:26,214
If it'd help,

163
00:06:26,216 --> 00:06:28,633
I'd chew up his food and
feed him like a baby bird.

164
00:06:28,635 --> 00:06:32,087
How could that
possibly help?

165
00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:34,422
I'll tell you what
doesn't help... that tone.

166
00:06:34,424 --> 00:06:36,224
Can we see him?

167
00:06:36,226 --> 00:06:37,592
Soon as he's
in recovery.

168
00:06:37,594 --> 00:06:38,843
Any other questions?

169
00:06:38,845 --> 00:06:40,595
Uh, no, we're just happy
that he's gonna be okay.

170
00:06:40,597 --> 00:06:41,597
Thank you.

171
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:42,814
My pleasure.

172
00:06:42,816 --> 00:06:45,150
By the way,<i> Ferris Bueller</i>
is my favorite movie.

173
00:06:47,571 --> 00:06:49,654
Wait, B-Berta.
W-Where are you going?

174
00:06:49,656 --> 00:06:51,072
We're not supposed
to go back there yet.

175
00:06:51,074 --> 00:06:52,657
I'm a nun at a hospital.

176
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:55,327
I can do whatever
the hell I want.

177
00:07:01,668 --> 00:07:04,069
I'm dead.

178
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,241
And I'm in hell.

179
00:07:11,194 --> 00:07:12,861
Relax.

180
00:07:12,863 --> 00:07:14,179
You're in the hospital.

181
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:16,598
You had a mild heart attack,
but you're gonna be fine.

182
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,316
I don't feel very good.

183
00:07:18,318 --> 00:07:20,552
That's because they put
a stent in your heart.

184
00:07:20,554 --> 00:07:22,971
But also I feel really good.

185
00:07:22,973 --> 00:07:27,192
That's because they put morphine
in your veins.

186
00:07:27,194 --> 00:07:30,011
We should start keeping morphine
in the house.

187
00:07:30,013 --> 00:07:32,697
I know a guy.

188
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:36,151
Berta, you're so funny.

189
00:07:36,153 --> 00:07:39,320
I would've missed you so much
if I would've died.

190
00:07:39,322 --> 00:07:41,456
Oh, oh, but you don't
have to worry about that.

191
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:42,540
Y-You're not going anywhere.

192
00:07:42,542 --> 00:07:44,159
I love you guys.

193
00:07:44,161 --> 00:07:45,443
We love you, too.

194
00:07:45,445 --> 00:07:47,629
You know, when I think about it,

195
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:50,382
you guys are
my only real family.

196
00:07:50,384 --> 00:07:52,384
Oh, Walden, that's so...

197
00:07:52,386 --> 00:07:54,886
Horrible.

198
00:07:54,888 --> 00:07:56,171
Okay.

199
00:07:56,173 --> 00:07:58,590
Saved your life, but whatever.

200
00:07:58,592 --> 00:08:00,658
My life is pathetic.

201
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,695
I mean, thank you guys so much
for being here.

202
00:08:03,697 --> 00:08:06,531
But you're not good enough!

203
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:09,350
Okay, now it sounds
like my family.

204
00:08:09,352 --> 00:08:11,186
Um...

205
00:08:11,188 --> 00:08:12,188
Maybe you should rest.

206
00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:13,605
You know, just go
to your happy place.

207
00:08:13,607 --> 00:08:15,156
I know a shortcut.

208
00:08:15,158 --> 00:08:16,158
Say when.

209
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:17,525
Whe...

210
00:08:19,996 --> 00:08:23,164
Dressed as a nun,
giving some guy morphine...

211
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:26,084
boy, does this take me
back to high school.

212
00:08:32,175 --> 00:08:34,459
Hey, how you feeling?

213
00:08:34,461 --> 00:08:35,543
I'm all right.

214
00:08:35,545 --> 00:08:37,345
Well, uh, I know

215
00:08:37,347 --> 00:08:39,597
something that'll
make you feel better.

216
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,933
I made some of my famous
three bean salad.

217
00:08:42,803 --> 00:08:44,269
The secret...

218
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:46,521
I use four beans.

219
00:08:48,008 --> 00:08:50,225
Garbanzo.

220
00:08:50,227 --> 00:08:51,726
Shh.

221
00:08:51,728 --> 00:08:54,229
You ever look out at the ocean

222
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:56,498
and think about how small
and insignificant you are?

223
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,818
I don't need the ocean;
I can just call my mother.

224
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,402
I almost died, Alan.

225
00:09:01,404 --> 00:09:03,071
But the important thing is
you didn't.

226
00:09:03,073 --> 00:09:05,156
So, now you just have
to listen to your doctors,

227
00:09:05,158 --> 00:09:06,491
don't stress about anything
and relax.

228
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:11,379
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

229
00:09:13,717 --> 00:09:15,667
Sorry.

230
00:09:15,669 --> 00:09:17,836
That was supposed to scare the
life out of trick-or-treaters,

231
00:09:17,838 --> 00:09:19,087
not you.

232
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:20,138
This sucks!

233
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,474
How am I the one
with a stent in my heart?

234
00:09:22,476 --> 00:09:24,259
I'm healthy, I-I'm fit.

235
00:09:24,261 --> 00:09:26,094
You sit in front
of the TV every night,

236
00:09:26,096 --> 00:09:28,213
shoveling a pint of ice cream
down your throat.

237
00:09:28,215 --> 00:09:29,764
Hey, I eat my feelings,

238
00:09:29,766 --> 00:09:32,100
and you are sending me
right back to the freezer.

239
00:09:32,102 --> 00:09:33,434
You know, it just goes to show,

240
00:09:33,436 --> 00:09:35,270
your life can end
in the blink of an eye.

241
00:09:35,272 --> 00:09:37,105
One day you're here,
the next day you're gone.

242
00:09:37,107 --> 00:09:38,606
That's why I live
by the philosophy

243
00:09:38,608 --> 00:09:41,409
"One day I'm here,
the next day I'm still here."

244
00:09:41,411 --> 00:09:45,613
You know, if-if I would have
died, who would have missed me?

245
00:09:45,615 --> 00:09:48,333
What are you talking about?
I would, Berta would.

246
00:09:48,335 --> 00:09:50,919
A-And you just got an e-mail
from Netflix the other day

247
00:09:50,921 --> 00:09:53,037
that literally said,
"We miss you."

248
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:58,459
You know, other than you guys
and my mom, I got nobody.

249
00:09:58,461 --> 00:10:00,128
At least you got Jake.

250
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,297
Well, that's true.

251
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:04,432
I'll always have
my little guy.

252
00:10:04,434 --> 00:10:06,267
Although, in his last e-mail,

253
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:09,637
he, uh, asked me when the
Fourth of July was this year.

254
00:10:11,808 --> 00:10:14,359
But, yes, I'm very lucky.

255
00:10:14,361 --> 00:10:17,812
Do you know how much
I would give to have a kid

256
00:10:17,814 --> 00:10:20,698
who didn't understand
the concept of a calendar?

257
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:24,152
All I have is money.

258
00:10:24,154 --> 00:10:25,537
Yeah.

259
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:28,690
'Cause I wouldn't give up Jake
for a billion dollars.

260
00:10:31,378 --> 00:10:33,378
I got to make some changes.

261
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,495
Changes are good.

262
00:10:34,497 --> 00:10:36,164
Uh, you know,
I remember when I switched

263
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,082
from<i> American Idol</i> to<i> The Voice.</i>

264
00:10:39,169 --> 00:10:40,501
My life turned around

265
00:10:40,503 --> 00:10:42,887
like Blake Shelton's chair.

266
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:44,672
You know what?

267
00:10:44,674 --> 00:10:46,724
I want to have a kid of my own.

268
00:10:46,726 --> 00:10:48,509
What?

269
00:10:48,511 --> 00:10:51,012
Yeah, I want something
to give my life meaning.

270
00:10:51,014 --> 00:10:53,565
I want somebody
I can love unconditionally.

271
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,017
Someone I can teach,
someone I can nurture,

272
00:10:56,019 --> 00:10:57,936
someone I can leave
all this to.

273
00:10:57,938 --> 00:10:59,187
Well...

274
00:10:59,189 --> 00:11:02,690
I mean, I don't know
what to say, except...

275
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:04,442
Papa?

276
00:11:04,444 --> 00:11:06,527
*<i> Men.</i> *

277
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:15,702
Have you thought
this through?

278
00:11:15,703 --> 00:11:17,053
Having a kid
is a lot of work.

279
00:11:17,055 --> 00:11:20,339
Having you is
a lot of work.

280
00:11:20,341 --> 00:11:22,541
You know, having a child
would give my life meaning.

281
00:11:22,543 --> 00:11:24,210
Otherwise, all this
has been for nothing,

282
00:11:24,212 --> 00:11:25,628
and that's difficult
to accept.

283
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,012
You know
what's difficult?

284
00:11:27,014 --> 00:11:29,598
Removing a marble
your kid shoved up his nose.

285
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,883
I did something like that.

286
00:11:30,885 --> 00:11:32,218
I jammed a penny up there.

287
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,020
I was trying to get a gumball
to fall out of my butt.

288
00:11:35,022 --> 00:11:36,972
But a kid
is permanent.

289
00:11:36,974 --> 00:11:38,274
It's not like you're dating.

290
00:11:38,276 --> 00:11:40,559
You can't just stop calling
or change your number

291
00:11:40,561 --> 00:11:42,695
or fake your own death
because they annoy you.

292
00:11:42,697 --> 00:11:44,146
You do that to women?

293
00:11:44,148 --> 00:11:45,548
No, they do it to me.

294
00:11:47,285 --> 00:11:49,885
Look, I-I'm sorry if it feels
like I'm being negative,

295
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,254
because the truth is,
you know, kids are amazing.

296
00:11:52,256 --> 00:11:54,490
But you just had
this big health scare,

297
00:11:54,492 --> 00:11:56,492
and you're probably not
in the best frame of mind

298
00:11:56,494 --> 00:11:57,743
to make life decisions.

299
00:11:57,745 --> 00:12:00,713
I mean, this morning,
you cried at a beer commercial.

300
00:12:00,715 --> 00:12:04,316
Yeah, but the horse and
the puppy were best friends!

301
00:12:04,318 --> 00:12:05,785
Look,

302
00:12:05,787 --> 00:12:07,670
having a heart attack
didn't make me realize

303
00:12:07,672 --> 00:12:10,339
I want to have a kid,
it made me realize

304
00:12:10,341 --> 00:12:12,057
I don't want to live
another day without one.

305
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:13,809
It was like a wake-up call.

306
00:12:13,811 --> 00:12:15,227
All right.

307
00:12:15,229 --> 00:12:19,398
If you really want to do this,
I will be here to support you.

308
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,866
From my room.

309
00:12:20,868 --> 00:12:24,136
Which, FYI, is way too drafty
to use as a nursery.

310
00:12:24,138 --> 00:12:26,405
Don't worry.
You're not going anywhere.

311
00:12:26,407 --> 00:12:27,857
Sweet! Let's get that kid!

312
00:12:28,609 --> 00:12:29,942
So, uh, who's the lucky lady

313
00:12:29,944 --> 00:12:31,827
who's gonna receive your seed?

314
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:34,163
See, you just put
your creepy little finger

315
00:12:34,165 --> 00:12:35,548
right on the problem.

316
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:39,168
I haven't exactly been
successful in love.

317
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:43,372
It's like I'm running JavaScript
and women are running HTML5.

318
00:12:44,842 --> 00:12:47,343
Talking like that is part
of the problem, isn't it?

319
00:12:47,345 --> 00:12:48,544
Yeah.

320
00:12:48,546 --> 00:12:50,713
And it's weird, because
your package is perfect.

321
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:55,551
And... and by "package,"
I don't mean your package,

322
00:12:55,553 --> 00:12:59,572
I mean your...
package.

323
00:13:00,391 --> 00:13:03,058
Although, that is also
a showstopper.

324
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,028
Okay, I can't believe that
this is not the first time

325
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,898
I've said this, but stop
looking at my penis.

326
00:13:11,385 --> 00:13:13,452
Well, now that
you've mentioned it,

327
00:13:13,454 --> 00:13:16,338
I can't stop looking.

328
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,624
It's like the elephant's trunk
in the room.

329
00:13:20,411 --> 00:13:22,378
Don't worry,
you'll-you'll find somebody.

330
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,380
And, you know,
it goes without saying

331
00:13:24,382 --> 00:13:27,466
that if I could, I would
happily bear you a child.

332
00:13:28,436 --> 00:13:31,637
Okay, I wish all of this
had gone without saying.

333
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:33,389
You doing okay?

334
00:13:33,391 --> 00:13:35,007
Yeah, I'm good.

335
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:37,810
He wants to have a kid.
Now all he needs is a woman.

336
00:13:37,812 --> 00:13:40,062
Would you consider
a pregnant stripper?

337
00:13:40,898 --> 00:13:42,731
Uh, no.

338
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:45,568
Well, that rules out
both my granddaughters.

339
00:13:51,776 --> 00:13:53,909
Morning. Did you
take your pills?

340
00:13:53,911 --> 00:13:55,311
Yep.

341
00:13:55,313 --> 00:13:57,663
Are you lying to me
or are you lying to yourself?

342
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:02,885
They're too big.
It's hard to swallow.

343
00:14:03,704 --> 00:14:05,371
If you say
"that's what she said,"

344
00:14:05,373 --> 00:14:07,039
I will kill you.

345
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,123
You know what she said?

346
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,543
"Take your pills.
I care about you."

347
00:14:10,545 --> 00:14:11,827
Fine.

348
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:14,179
Do you know how long
it takes to get a baby?

349
00:14:14,181 --> 00:14:17,383
Well, I know it takes, uh,
five months of mood swings

350
00:14:17,385 --> 00:14:20,469
and four months of not
wanting to be touched.

351
00:14:20,471 --> 00:14:23,522
And who knows what my ex-wife
was going through.

352
00:14:23,524 --> 00:14:24,723
I was just
researching surrogacy,

353
00:14:24,725 --> 00:14:26,792
and they say that once
you choose a great candidate,

354
00:14:26,794 --> 00:14:28,260
it can take
up to three years

355
00:14:28,262 --> 00:14:30,229
before you have
a baby in your arm.

356
00:14:30,231 --> 00:14:31,630
I can't wait that long.

357
00:14:31,632 --> 00:14:34,099
I mean, who knows if I'll even
still want a kid by then?

358
00:14:34,101 --> 00:14:35,534
Tell me about it.

359
00:14:35,536 --> 00:14:38,821
Six months into Jake's life,
I was like, "Check, please!"

360
00:14:38,823 --> 00:14:40,739
I was kidding.

361
00:14:40,741 --> 00:14:42,775
As was I.

362
00:14:45,046 --> 00:14:46,412
Okay.

363
00:14:46,414 --> 00:14:48,631
I've narrowed down my options
to either adoption

364
00:14:48,633 --> 00:14:50,149
or seeing if
Brad and Angelina

365
00:14:50,151 --> 00:14:52,234
have an extra one
they could throw me.

366
00:14:52,236 --> 00:14:54,253
Uh, you know, if you really
want to adopt...

367
00:14:54,255 --> 00:14:57,389
For the last time, Alan,
I am not adopting you!

368
00:14:57,391 --> 00:14:59,174
But, Papa...

369
00:14:59,176 --> 00:15:01,377
Ah! All right.

370
00:15:04,765 --> 00:15:06,815
I already reached out
to a lawyer

371
00:15:06,817 --> 00:15:08,601
who specializes in adoption.

372
00:15:08,603 --> 00:15:10,936
Well, you're a perfect
candidate to adopt.

373
00:15:10,938 --> 00:15:13,188
I mean, you're highly educated,
you're likeable,

374
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,024
uh, you have a stable
home environment...

375
00:15:15,026 --> 00:15:19,328
Financially secure,
no criminal record, handsome.

376
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:23,115
I-I don't... I don't think
handsome really comes into play.

377
00:15:23,117 --> 00:15:25,618
Doesn't it, Alan?

378
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,736
No, I don't think so.

379
00:15:29,957 --> 00:15:31,340
Doesn't it?

380
00:15:31,342 --> 00:15:33,142
You're being ridiculous.

381
00:15:33,144 --> 00:15:34,710
Am I?

382
00:15:36,597 --> 00:15:39,014
I will steal you a baby.

383
00:15:40,601 --> 00:15:42,468
*<i> Men.</i> *

384
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,803
So, as you can see,
finances are not an issue.

385
00:15:44,805 --> 00:15:46,472
I have a lot of
extra free time,

386
00:15:46,474 --> 00:15:49,775
and I know I can provide
a loving, nurturing home.

387
00:15:50,611 --> 00:15:52,444
You okay?

388
00:15:52,446 --> 00:15:55,314
Are you?

389
00:15:55,316 --> 00:15:57,549
Seriously, do I need
to call someone?

390
00:15:58,369 --> 00:15:59,618
Never mind.

391
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,736
What's important is that

392
00:16:00,738 --> 00:16:02,488
I will coach the hell
out of the Braves.

393
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:03,739
Excuse me?

394
00:16:03,741 --> 00:16:05,708
It'll be the name of
my son's tee-ball team.

395
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,459
Pretty Pink Ponies,
if it's a girl.

396
00:16:07,461 --> 00:16:09,495
You know what,
if my son wants to play

397
00:16:09,497 --> 00:16:11,664
for the Pretty Pink Ponies,
then so be it.

398
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,716
Tolerant.

399
00:16:14,552 --> 00:16:15,801
Well, Mr. Schmidt,

400
00:16:15,803 --> 00:16:18,087
you are obviously
more than qualified.

401
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:19,021
Thank you.

402
00:16:19,023 --> 00:16:20,172
That said, I'd start looking

403
00:16:20,174 --> 00:16:21,473
at Golden Retriever puppies,

404
00:16:21,475 --> 00:16:22,891
'cause there's no way
you're getting a baby.

405
00:16:22,893 --> 00:16:24,727
Well, I don't understand.

406
00:16:24,729 --> 00:16:26,428
You just said that
I'm more than qualified.

407
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,479
And you are.

408
00:16:27,481 --> 00:16:28,814
But you're a single guy,

409
00:16:28,816 --> 00:16:31,066
and the system is really geared
towards married couples.

410
00:16:31,068 --> 00:16:32,701
That's racist.

411
00:16:32,703 --> 00:16:35,304
Uh, no, it's not.

412
00:16:35,306 --> 00:16:36,705
Then it's sexist.

413
00:16:36,707 --> 00:16:38,273
Nope.

414
00:16:38,275 --> 00:16:40,743
Well, it's some kind of "sist."

415
00:16:40,745 --> 00:16:43,028
Look, I'm not saying
it's impossible, okay?

416
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,446
Just that it's difficult.

417
00:16:44,448 --> 00:16:47,249
You're in line behind families
that already have children,

418
00:16:47,251 --> 00:16:48,817
married couples, single women...

419
00:16:48,819 --> 00:16:49,835
Anyone else?

420
00:16:49,837 --> 00:16:51,537
What, sweat shops? Circuses?

421
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:53,005
The Vienna Boys' Choir?

422
00:16:53,007 --> 00:16:55,174
Look, I wish
I had better news, okay?

423
00:16:55,176 --> 00:16:57,593
If you were married,
this would be a slam dunk.

424
00:16:57,595 --> 00:16:59,294
Okay, you don't get it.

425
00:16:59,296 --> 00:17:01,680
Marriage is not
an option for me.

426
00:17:01,682 --> 00:17:04,016
Okay, I understand
you're frustrated...

427
00:17:04,018 --> 00:17:06,135
No, what's frustrating
is that every woman I meet

428
00:17:06,137 --> 00:17:07,386
runs screaming from me!

429
00:17:07,388 --> 00:17:08,437
I was married before
and she left me

430
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:10,022
and I tried to commit suicide.

431
00:17:10,024 --> 00:17:11,356
Don't write that down.

432
00:17:11,358 --> 00:17:12,775
Why are you
writing that down?!

433
00:17:12,777 --> 00:17:13,942
No, no...

434
00:17:13,944 --> 00:17:15,360
Then I proposed
to two other women,

435
00:17:15,362 --> 00:17:16,645
and they both shot me down.

436
00:17:16,647 --> 00:17:18,113
I am incapable of maintaining

437
00:17:18,115 --> 00:17:20,032
a long-term relationship
with anybody.

438
00:17:20,034 --> 00:17:21,734
Now, give me a frickin' baby!

439
00:17:21,736 --> 00:17:23,152
Okay.

440
00:17:23,154 --> 00:17:24,203
I think we're done here.

441
00:17:24,205 --> 00:17:25,871
No, we are
not done here!

442
00:17:25,873 --> 00:17:27,906
I almost died wearing
a bedazzled jumpsuit

443
00:17:27,908 --> 00:17:29,291
and my life
needs meaning.

444
00:17:29,293 --> 00:17:31,210
Stop writing
things down!

445
00:17:37,468 --> 00:17:38,584
Mmm.

446
00:17:38,586 --> 00:17:40,335
Hey, how'd it go?
What kind of world...

447
00:17:40,337 --> 00:17:41,220
Uh-oh.

448
00:17:41,222 --> 00:17:42,588
...are we living in

449
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:45,507
where any two high school kids
with a broken condom

450
00:17:45,509 --> 00:17:47,676
can screw behind
an Applebee's Dumpster,

451
00:17:47,678 --> 00:17:49,511
have a baby,
give it up for adoption,

452
00:17:49,513 --> 00:17:53,432
but not have it go to
an adult who is upstanding,

453
00:17:53,434 --> 00:17:56,852
responsible,
and, might I add, handsome...

454
00:17:58,239 --> 00:18:00,272
...simply because
every woman I meet

455
00:18:00,274 --> 00:18:01,607
eventually grows to loathe me?

456
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:03,442
And because of that,
the Pretty Pink Ponies

457
00:18:03,444 --> 00:18:05,778
will not have a tee-ball coach!

458
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,546
So it didn't go well?

459
00:18:07,548 --> 00:18:09,114
No, it did not go well.

460
00:18:09,116 --> 00:18:12,201
All right, well, uh,
first things first.

461
00:18:12,203 --> 00:18:14,253
Uh, how about we get
you a little Zin

462
00:18:14,255 --> 00:18:15,571
to calm your nerves?

463
00:18:15,573 --> 00:18:16,955
It's just not fair.

464
00:18:16,957 --> 00:18:17,957
I know, I know.

465
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,341
Uh, thank you.

466
00:18:19,343 --> 00:18:21,627
Just because I'm single,
I'm not a fit parent?

467
00:18:21,629 --> 00:18:23,212
Did they say that to you?

468
00:18:24,048 --> 00:18:26,799
That's how I felt.

469
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:28,016
Apparently, the whole system

470
00:18:28,018 --> 00:18:30,052
is geared towards
married couples.

471
00:18:30,054 --> 00:18:31,553
And-and single guys
are not welcome.

472
00:18:31,555 --> 00:18:33,388
Like a Studio City
swingers party.

473
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,691
Exactly.

474
00:18:35,693 --> 00:18:37,693
Wait, what?

475
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:39,978
Nothing. So, uh, did you
tell her everything?

476
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,314
I mean, how you're successful,
you're warm, you're caring...

477
00:18:42,316 --> 00:18:44,032
I told her everything.
Did you give her the smile?

478
00:18:44,034 --> 00:18:45,868
Of course I gave
her the smile.

479
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,703
She thought I was
having a stroke.

480
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:49,805
So nothing worked?

481
00:18:49,807 --> 00:18:52,074
No. Even if I hadn't been
escorted out by security,

482
00:18:52,076 --> 00:18:54,293
I still don't think
they were giving me a kid.

483
00:18:54,295 --> 00:18:56,411
Wow, I'm, uh...
I'm really sorry.

484
00:18:56,413 --> 00:18:57,830
You know, it's ridiculous.

485
00:18:57,832 --> 00:19:00,632
Why-why are married people
automatically better parents?

486
00:19:00,634 --> 00:19:03,218
My mom was married six
times; didn't help her.

487
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,721
See, and I would've been
a great dad.

488
00:19:05,723 --> 00:19:07,339
I would've played
catch with him,

489
00:19:07,341 --> 00:19:08,473
I would've read to him,

490
00:19:08,475 --> 00:19:10,225
I would've waited
till he went to sleep

491
00:19:10,227 --> 00:19:12,344
before I smoked pot.

492
00:19:12,346 --> 00:19:14,980
Already got my mom beat.

493
00:19:14,982 --> 00:19:16,182
But-but you shouldn't give up.

494
00:19:16,183 --> 00:19:17,766
I mean, you might
still find somebody.

495
00:19:17,768 --> 00:19:19,318
No, I don't want
to marry somebody

496
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,769
just to marry somebody.

497
00:19:20,771 --> 00:19:22,354
It's got to be the right person.

498
00:19:22,356 --> 00:19:24,156
Ooh, or Mila Kunis.

499
00:19:25,242 --> 00:19:26,575
I get it.

500
00:19:26,577 --> 00:19:27,693
That's hard to find.

501
00:19:27,695 --> 00:19:29,494
Oh, that's my banana bread.

502
00:19:29,496 --> 00:19:31,146
I love your banana bread.

503
00:19:31,148 --> 00:19:32,080
I know.

504
00:19:32,082 --> 00:19:33,665
I made it hoping
we could celebrate,

505
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:36,568
but it works on
a sad tummy, too.

506
00:19:37,438 --> 00:19:39,388
Oh, what would I do without you?

507
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:42,090
I hope you never have
to find out.

508
00:19:43,827 --> 00:19:45,794
What?

509
00:19:45,796 --> 00:19:49,414
You are... always there for me.

510
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,216
Yeah, and-and you're always
there for me.

511
00:19:51,218 --> 00:19:52,734
We're best friends.

512
00:19:54,889 --> 00:19:58,273
What if we were
more than friends?

513
00:19:59,143 --> 00:20:02,477
Like...

514
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:04,696
super friends?

515
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,019
Alan Harper,

516
00:20:11,021 --> 00:20:12,671
will you marry me?

517
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,877
*<i> Men.</i> *

518
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:30,636
Are you seriously
asking me to marry you?

519
00:20:33,591 --> 00:20:35,858
I can't believe
this is happening.

520
00:20:38,189 --> 00:20:41,423
And I always thought Alan
would be the one on his knees.

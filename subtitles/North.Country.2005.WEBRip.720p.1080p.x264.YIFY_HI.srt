They can't do this to us.

839
01:10:19,891 --> 01:10:21,136
Sure, they can.

840
01:10:21,309 --> 01:10:24,844
They're gonna keep on doing it worse,
as long as you keep opening your mouth.

841
01:10:25,814 --> 01:10:28,269
- Sherry, what they did to you
- You didn't help any.

842
01:10:28,441 --> 01:10:30,185
That's for sure.

843
01:10:32,863 --> 01:10:36,812
Don't look at me.
This is our lives you're screwing with.

844
01:10:37,659 --> 01:10:41,324
Your mess, start cleaning.

845
01:10:52,674 --> 01:10:57,669
Hey, Josey, how you like your
new scratch-and-sniff wallpaper?

846
01:10:59,973 --> 01:11:02,974
Was it him? Was it?

847
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:06,145
I give a piece of my check
to that union, like everyone else.

848
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:09,303
You fucked up.
What do you want me to say?

849
01:11:09,482 --> 01:11:14,477
Hey, lovebirds, wanna get to work?
Or should I dim the lights for you?

850
01:11:14,988 --> 01:11:18,689
Josey, get your ass down here.
I got a job for you in the Powder Room.

851
01:11:33,048 --> 01:11:35,717
You're one crazy bitch,
you know that?

852
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:39,052
- You said you had a job for me.
- Yeah.

853
01:11:44,726 --> 01:11:46,185
You like that, don't you?

854
01:11:46,353 --> 01:11:49,389
You like that. To grab your
pussy like that, don't you?

855
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:52,977
Forgot you like it a little rough.

856

857
01:11:57,405 --> 01:12:01,735

Damn you, Josey.

860
01:12:39,906 --> 01:12:41,187
He attacked me.

861
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:45,949
- Who attacked you?
- Bobby, in the Powder Room, just now.

862
01:12:46,788 --> 01:12:50,038
- Bobby, you lay a hand on her?
- Sure you wanna ask that, Rick?

863
01:12:56,464 --> 01:12:59,216
The answer's no. I wasn't in
the Powder Room all day.

864
01:12:59,384 --> 01:13:02,301

with me all afternoon.</i>

- Betty.

I quit.

873
01:14:08,870 --> 01:14:11,954

Well, you're not an employee anymore.
You're not required to be here.

879
01:14:29,390 --> 01:14:33,388
Yeah, well. Thought maybe
I could help you out.

880
01:14:33,937 --> 01:14:36,392
Kind of out of control
up there, isn't it?

881
01:14:40,985 --> 01:14:43,523
I'm not saying Josey should've
gone to management or anything

Please don't.

887
01:16:04,986 --> 01:16:08,651
- Got a hundred of them out here.
- I need a lawyer.

888
01:16:09,574 --> 01:16:12,065
I wanna sue the mine.
The company. All of them.

889
01:16:12,243 --> 01:16:15,493
Well, good luck with that.

890
01:16:17,832 --> 01:16:19,991
I'm saying I wanna hire you.

891
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:23,995
Sorry, don't do that anymore.

892
01:16:25,882 --> 01:16:28,503
That sucks, because you're
the only lawyer I ever met.

893
01:16:28,676 --> 01:16:33,054
Well, the good news is,
all roads lead to lawyers.

894
01:16:34,515 --> 01:16:37,469
Tell you what.
I will buy you a beer, though.

895
01:16:37,894 --> 01:16:39,933
I don't need a beer.

896
01:16:40,104 --> 01:16:42,144
I need a lawyer.

897
01:16:42,315 --> 01:16:48,270
Look, Josey, the illusion is that all
your problems are solved in a courtroom.

898
01:16:48,446 --> 01:16:51,815
The reality is that even
when you win, you don't win.

899
01:16:51,991 --> 01:16:53,699
I know that I'm right.

900
01:16:53,868 --> 01:16:58,032
I'm sure you are, but right
has nothing to do with the real world.

901
01:16:58,206 --> 01:17:00,911
Look at Anita Hill.
Because she's you.

902
01:17:01,209 --> 01:17:04,993
You think you're outgunned at the mine,
wait till you get to a courtroom.

903
01:17:05,171 --> 01:17:07,045
It's called the
"nuts and sluts defense."

904
01:17:07,215 --> 01:17:10,714
You're either nuts and you imagined it,
or a slut and you asked for it.

905
01:17:10,885 --> 01:17:13,672
Either way, it's not pleasant.

906
01:17:14,973 --> 01:17:20,512
Take my advice. Find another job.
Start over.

907
01:17:23,231 --> 01:17:25,389
I don't have any start-over left.

908
01:17:26,276 --> 01:17:31,436
- Look, you're a beautiful girl
- Yeah, I'm a beautiful girl.

909
01:17:31,614 --> 01:17:34,284
I could find a guy to take care of me.

910
01:17:35,910 --> 01:17:38,033
I'm done looking to be taken care of.

911
01:17:38,413 --> 01:17:41,663
I wanna take care of myself.
Take care of my kids.

912
01:17:45,253 --> 01:17:47,495
You know it's happening to all of us.

913
01:17:47,672 --> 01:17:50,080
Every woman up there.

914
01:17:55,346 --> 01:17:57,754
But you don't give a shit, do you?

915
01:18:15,783 --> 01:18:19,947
If somebody like her came to see me back
in New York with this dogshit case

916
01:18:20,121 --> 01:18:22,410
you know what I'd do?

917
01:18:22,582 --> 01:18:24,491
I'd take it.

918
01:18:24,834 --> 01:18:26,708
Settle quick, pocket the contingency

919
01:18:26,878 --> 01:18:29,962
make more money than her,
never see a courtroom.

920
01:18:30,173 --> 01:18:32,082
Pearson would never settle.

921
01:18:32,258 --> 01:18:34,381
- Sure he would.
- No.

922
01:18:34,635 --> 01:18:36,961
It would be her word
against everybody else.

923
01:18:37,138 --> 01:18:41,551
All the guys up there can't be bad,
which makes some of them witnesses.

924
01:18:43,436 --> 01:18:45,974
That mine is bread and butter
for people around here.

925
01:18:46,147 --> 01:18:48,982
Nobody wants to shit where they eat.

926
01:18:53,488 --> 01:18:56,904
What is this place?
Like a pet cemetery or something?

927
01:18:57,825 --> 01:19:01,241
Why, you got a lot of pet elk at home?

928
01:19:02,830 --> 01:19:06,164
So they never picked on Glory, why?

929
01:19:06,334 --> 01:19:09,335
Would you wanna
pick a fight with Glory?

930
01:19:11,672 --> 01:19:16,833
No, Glory became a union rep early on.
She did some good things.

931
01:19:17,011 --> 01:19:18,671
Got their respect.

932
01:19:19,138 --> 01:19:22,175
Plus, she doesn't wanna
run with the herd.

933
01:19:22,350 --> 01:19:25,849

- Safety in numbers.

Can you get the other women?

938
01:19:54,757 --> 01:19:57,213
You know what a class action is?

939
01:19:57,385 --> 01:20:00,920
It's when a bunch of plaintiffs
have the same issue.

940
01:20:01,097 --> 01:20:04,347
File a claim on behalf
of the whole group, the class.

941
01:20:04,851 --> 01:20:07,520
It's tough for the company to
argue that you're all lying.

942
01:20:07,687 --> 01:20:12,100
You're all crazy. It's why you
have to get the others.

943
01:20:15,903 --> 01:20:18,441
Why'd you change your mind?

944
01:20:22,660 --> 01:20:24,487
It's never been done before.

from this court, Your Honor.

We are asking for an injunction
to protect all the women.

966
01:21:58,005 --> 01:22:00,413
Further, we ask the court
to certify a class.

967

A class made up of every woman
working at Pearson

968
01:22:03,261 --> 01:22:06,676
because every one of them
deserves protection under the law.

969
01:22:06,847 --> 01:22:09,884
Doesn't a class actually require
more than one plaintiff?

970
01:22:10,059 --> 01:22:12,846
This complaint was filed
on behalf of one Josey Aimes.

no incidents of abuse

1333
01:50:27,171 --> 01:50:30,042
I don't want any more secrets between us.

1334
01:50:38,391 --> 01:50:40,134
This one night...

1335
01:50:41,477 --> 01:50:43,802
I was lying in bed

1336
01:50:44,647 --> 01:50:46,853
and you moved inside me

1337
01:50:47,233 --> 01:50:52,109
like this tiny little butterfly,
just fluttering around in there.

1338
01:50:54,407 --> 01:50:56,814
And all of a sudden, I realized

1339
01:50:57,743 --> 01:50:59,736
I just knew...

1340
01:51:00,746 --> 01:51:03,154
I knew you weren't his.

1341
01:51:04,584 --> 01:51:06,742
You were mine.

1342
01:51:06,919 --> 01:51:09,410
You were my baby.

1343
01:51:10,089 --> 01:51:11,916
And we were gonna be in it together.

1344
01:51:12,758 --> 01:51:14,917
Just the two of us.

1345
01:51:20,016 --> 01:51:23,515
You had nothing to do with that
ugliness, you hear me? Nothing.

1346
01:51:27,940 --> 01:51:31,855
And there's nothing in this world
I wouldn't do to be your mom.

1347
01:52:00,473 --> 01:52:02,300
I should've told you.

1348
01:52:07,647 --> 01:52:09,354
It's over, isn't it?

1349
01:52:12,485 --> 01:52:14,027
Not yet.

1350
01:52:23,954 --> 01:52:27,786
Mr. Sharp, do you know the difference
between consensual sex and rape?

1351
01:52:27,958 --> 01:52:29,501
Oh, yeah.

1352
01:52:29,669 --> 01:52:32,206
But when you're having a
good time like she was

1353
01:52:32,380 --> 01:52:34,586
ain't no rape. That's for damn sure.

1354
01:52:36,717 --> 01:52:38,757
Are you a virgin?

1355
01:52:38,928 --> 01:52:41,549
- No. I ain't a virgin.
- Objection, Your Honor. Relevance?

1356
01:52:41,722 --> 01:52:46,183
She can ask about my client's sexual
history, but I can't ask this witness?

1357
01:52:46,352 --> 01:52:48,309
No, you can't. Sustained.

1358
01:52:48,479 --> 01:52:50,472
- <i>BILL: Why didn't you help her?
- CONLIN: Objection.</i>

1359
01:52:50,648 --> 01:52:52,107
<i>BILL: You saw Josey being attacked.</i>

1360
01:52:52,274 --> 01:52:54,682
Miss Aimes' testimony has not been
corroborated by evidence.

1361
01:52:54,860 --> 01:52:58,229
Neither has his. And my client
would like to prove that he's lying.

1362
01:52:58,406 --> 01:53:00,197
I'm allowing it. For now.

1363
01:53:01,992 --> 01:53:03,403
Bobby?

1364
01:53:03,577 --> 01:53:07,278
When you saw Josey being attacked,
why didn't you help her?

1365
01:53:07,456 --> 01:53:10,908
You know, you can use all the
lawyer mumbo-jumbo you want

1366
01:53:11,085 --> 01:53:14,703
- this still was no attack.
- <i>BILL: I asked around about you, Bobby.</i>

1367
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:16,209
Folks say you're kind of soft.

1368
01:53:16,382 --> 01:53:19,169
Anyone that said that ain't man
enough to say it to my face.

1369
01:53:19,343 --> 01:53:21,170
Are you a red-ice player, then?

1370
01:53:22,555 --> 01:53:24,382
- How's that?
- I had a coach used to say,

1371
01:53:24,557 --> 01:53:27,392
"Win or lose, leave your blood on the ice."

1372
01:53:27,893 --> 01:53:29,352
Good coach.

1373
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:30,765
Yeah.

1374
01:53:30,938 --> 01:53:33,061
You're what coach would call

1375
01:53:33,232 --> 01:53:34,726
a yellow-ice player.

1376
01:53:34,900 --> 01:53:37,226
The kind that wets his pants
when things get rough.

1377
01:53:37,403 --> 01:53:39,479
- <i>CONLIN: Objection. Argumentative.
- JUDGE: Denied.</i>

1378
01:53:39,655 --> 01:53:43,569
She was your friend. You watched
him put his filthy hands on her

1379
01:53:43,743 --> 01:53:45,901
and you ran away.

1380
01:53:46,078 --> 01:53:47,738
- It wasn't like that.
- Your Honor...

1381
01:53:47,913 --> 01:53:49,787
- Sustained. Mr. White
- What was it like then?

1382
01:53:49,957 --> 01:53:51,451
He held her down, spread her legs

1383
01:53:51,625 --> 01:53:54,247
- jammed himself up inside her...?
- Mr. White!

1384
01:53:56,255 --> 01:53:59,042
<i>BILL: Rangers are hard as steel, huh?</i>

1385
01:54:00,134 --> 01:54:01,758
Not this one.

1386
01:54:01,927 --> 01:54:03,754
This one's made of butter.

1387
01:54:04,805 --> 01:54:08,554
You gonna keep lying about your friend,
or you gonna stand up and be a man?

1388
01:54:08,726 --> 01:54:10,185
- <i>CONLIN: Objection.</i>
- I'm not lying.

1389
01:54:10,352 --> 01:54:12,511
- You wanna run right now, don't you?
- Fuck you.

1390
01:54:12,688 --> 01:54:14,348
- All right. That's enough.
- You wanna run?

1391
01:54:14,523 --> 01:54:18,307
- I didn't run.
- Or you gonna put your guts on the ice?

1392
01:54:18,486 --> 01:54:20,692
What's it gonna be? Yellow?

1393
01:54:21,113 --> 01:54:22,691
Or red?

1394
01:54:23,115 --> 01:54:24,942
Yellow or red?

1395
01:54:26,035 --> 01:54:29,570
- Yellow or red?!
- What was I supposed to do?!

1396
01:54:29,747 --> 01:54:31,953
<i>(PEOPLE MURMURING)</i>

1397
01:54:37,755 --> 01:54:39,415
He was raping her, wasn't he?

1398
01:54:44,512 --> 01:54:45,970
Yeah.

1399
01:54:49,809 --> 01:54:51,469
And you ran.

1400
01:54:54,522 --> 01:54:56,313
What was I supposed to do?

1401
01:55:03,989 --> 01:55:05,899
<i>BILL: What are you supposed to do</i>

1402
01:55:06,075 --> 01:55:11,365
when the ones with all the power
are hurting those with none?

1403
01:55:14,667 --> 01:55:17,158
Well, for starters, you stand up.

1404
01:55:18,629 --> 01:55:21,202
You stand up and tell the truth.

1405
01:55:21,924 --> 01:55:23,632
You stand up...

1406
01:55:24,176 --> 01:55:25,670
for your friends.

1407
01:55:25,845 --> 01:55:28,881
- <i>CONLIN: Objection, Your Honor.
- BILL: You stand up...</i>

1408
01:55:29,056 --> 01:55:30,930
even when you're all alone.

1409
01:55:31,976 --> 01:55:33,007
(KNOCKING)

1410
01:55:33,185 --> 01:55:35,225
- You stand up.
- <i>JUDGE: All right.</i>

1411
01:55:35,396 --> 01:55:37,638
- Mr. White, if you are through--
- Excuse me.

1412
01:55:37,815 --> 01:55:39,439
What is going on back there?

1413
01:55:40,693 --> 01:55:43,018
This is Glory.

1414
01:55:44,321 --> 01:55:46,991
She worked at Pearson's.

1415
01:55:47,700 --> 01:55:49,408
She wants to say,

1416
01:55:51,662 --> 01:55:54,948
"My name is Glory Dodge.

1417
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,206
And I'm not fucking dead yet.

1418
01:55:59,044 --> 01:56:01,286
I stand with Josey."

1419
01:56:13,976 --> 01:56:15,007
Your Honor?

1420
01:56:15,185 --> 01:56:17,059
<i>BILL: Your Honor said
we need three plaintiffs.</i>

1421
01:56:17,229 --> 01:56:18,308
<i>CONLIN: It's still only two.</i>

1422
01:58:13,303 --> 01:58:14,762
<i>BILL: Ready?</i>

1423
01:58:16,348 --> 01:58:17,926
Yeah!

1424
01:58:18,100 --> 01:58:19,345
Nice.

1425
01:58:22,938 --> 01:58:25,346
- Yeah!
- <i>BILL: Oh, yeah!</i>

1426
01:58:30,529 --> 01:58:33,150
Hey, your son was just telling me
how rich you guys are now.

1427
01:58:33,323 --> 01:58:34,355
(LAUGHING)

1428
01:58:34,533 --> 01:58:36,573
- Oh, really?
- You gonna buy me a car?

1429
01:58:36,744 --> 01:58:40,029
- No. You're not old enough to drive yet.
- So?

1430
01:58:58,515 --> 01:59:00,508
Why are we stopping?

1431
01:59:00,684 --> 01:59:04,018
Well, if you want a car someday,
you gotta know how to drive it, right?

1432
01:59:04,188 --> 01:59:05,598
First lesson...

1433
01:59:05,773 --> 01:59:08,145
Driver sits behind the wheel.

1434
01:59:08,901 --> 01:59:10,728
Come on, move your butt.

1435
01:59:12,821 --> 01:59:14,399
Seat belt.

1436
01:59:15,157 --> 01:59:16,948
All right.

1437
01:59:17,117 --> 01:59:18,659
- What do I do?
- Okay.

1438
01:59:18,827 --> 01:59:21,994
Put your foot on the accelerator.
Gently, okay?

1439
01:59:22,164 --> 01:59:24,737
And stay on the road if you can.

1440
01:59:25,918 --> 01:59:27,412
Go on, go on.

1441
01:59:27,628 --> 01:59:29,205
(SQUEALING)

1442
01:59:30,255 --> 01:59:34,253
All right. Let's take a tiny
little bit at a time. Okay.

1443
01:59:34,426 --> 01:59:36,086
Slow down.

1444
01:59:36,261 --> 01:59:38,966
Slow down, racecar driver.

1445
01:59:39,765 --> 01:59:42,932
There you go. You're a natural.

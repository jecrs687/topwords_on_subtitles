1
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,960
I need money.

2
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:57,630
Yes, it is a lovely morning, isn't it?
Sun is shining, the birds are chirping.

3
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,890
Only dentist I know who
can't make money.

4
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,470
Oh, really? What about her father?

5
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,890
As a dentist,
my husband was very successful.

6
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,730
It was just that other stuff.

7
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,270
Yes. There's a word for that
other stuff. It's called embezzlement.

8
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,650
Speaking of which,
how much do you need, dear?

9
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,660
Five should probably do it.

10
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,320
Thousand? For what?

11
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,700
You know what?
Your father would be proud.

12
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,920
I'll see what I can do.

13
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,840
In the meantime,
you ladies have a lovely day.

14
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,130
I would, if you'd do me a favor and die.

15
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,020
Excuse me. Are you threatening me?

16
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,990
I didn't think so. Look,

17
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,360
I changed my mind, okay?
Yes, I'll get you your money back.

18
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,620
Morning, doctor.

19
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,960
Okay. Good news, Monsieur Boulez.

20
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,720
Not gonna have to pull the tooth.
All we have to do is drill.

21
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,550
- No drill.
- No drill?

22
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,140
No drill. I hate the drill.

23
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:33,140
So you just gas me, pull the tooth out,
and we'll still be friends. Okay?

24
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,230
Good.

25
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,650
I want a hamburger and fries.

26
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,950
Okay. I'm gonna have a hamburger

27
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,360
with no mayonnaise this time.

28
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:51,410
- No mayonnaise?
- No mayonnaise. Not at all. Okay?

29
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,120
- She's gonna put mayonnaise on it.
- Do you mind if I say something?

30
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,500
Leave the bitch.

31
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,590
- Excuse me?
- Your wife. Leave her.

32
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,840
Find somebody else
and just start over.

33
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,630
- Jill...
- Oz, I know it's none of my business.

34
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,850
I know I've only been working for you
for three weeks.

35
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,480
But I'm just telling you what I see,
mister. Your wife is not a good person.

36
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,310
- You're expecting an argument?
- Why do you torture yourself?

37
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,900
- Just divorce her.
- I can't afford to.

38
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,280
She'd take me to the cleaners.
I'm already paying her father's debt.

39
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,110
So she's gonna ride it out
till Daddy's debt gets paid.

40
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,120
- She's just charming, isn't she?
- She can't help it. Her mother...

41
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,290
What's a nice way of...?

42
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,580
Her mother is... She...
Well, she's the Antichrist.

43
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:42,000
You know, you'd be doing the world
a favor if you'd just have her whacked.

44
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,460
You know somebody who'd do this?

45
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,470
Present company excluded?

46
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,680
- Voilà.
<i>- Merci.</i>

47
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,720
Hypothetically?
Or do you want me to name a price?

48
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,680
Well, you should talk to my wife.
You'd make a fortune.

49
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,730
- What makes you say that?
- Life insurance.

50
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,860
I'm worth more dead than alive.

51
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,920
That one. Good.

52
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:31,300
Yeah, just dining room.
Take the plastic junk off of there.

53
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,260
Can you move
any slower than this, fellas?

54
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,470
Hi. You must be our new neighbor.

55
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,770
I'm Nicholas Oseransky. Call me Oz.

56
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,230
Jimmy.

57
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,190
- Hi.
- Jimmy Jones.

58
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,730
- Have we met before?
- No.

59
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,320
Are you sure?

60
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,950
Yeah. I'd remember.
I got a thing with faces.

61
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,530
That is so weird. You look so familiar.
Where are you from?

62
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,080
Mr. Jones, where do you want this?

63
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,220
<i>Order! Order!</i>

64
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,570
Upstairs, back bedroom.

65
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,240
What were you saying?

66
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,780
- You all right?
- Yes.

67
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,700
You sure? Because you look
like you got some gas.

68
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,000
Well, I had a hamburger for lunch.

69
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,630
- They put mayonnaise on it?
- Yes.

70
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,170
Can you tell me why they do that?

71
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,430
Every red-blooded American knows
the only condiment

72
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:58,430
you are ever supposed to put
on a hamburger is ketchup!

73
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,520
Or maybe some of that special sauce
you like so much here in Canada!

74
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,810
Which has a little mayonnaise in it too.

75
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,900
I swear to God, when they slop that
mayonnaise on, I could kill somebody.

76
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,240
I really, really didn't wanna upset you.

77
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,610
Who's upset?
I'm just having a conversation here.

78
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,700
- I'm gonna go home.
- Okay.

79
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,870
- Feel better.
- Thank you.

80
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,670
- Oz.
- Yes!

81
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,050
Thanks for stopping by,

82
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,380
welcoming me to the neighborhood.

83
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,140
Okay.

84
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,270
Pack up! Pack up! We're leaving!

85
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,320
Jesus!

86
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,780
Jesus! I just bumped
into our new next-door neighbor.

87
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,410
- Any idea who that is?
- I suppose you're going to tell me.

88
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,950
That's Jimmy "the Tulip" Tudeski.

89
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,410
And that means something?

90
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,080
Jimmy the Tulip was a hit man
for the Gogolak gang.

91
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,880
Yes, baby. Yes.

92
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,880
The Gogolak gang. The Hungarian gang
back in Chicago that ran the north side?

93
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:17,720
That guy, Jimmy, right over there,
was Lazlo Gogolak's key enforcer.

94
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,020
Sexy.

95
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,860
Sophie, the man's killed 17 people.

96
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,110
Why the stupid name?

97
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,650
"The Tulip"?
That's his flower of choice.

98
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,500
It's what he sent
to his victims' funerals.

99
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,280
- I wonder what he's doing here.
- Well, hiding out.

100
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,160
He ratted out Lazlo Gogolak.

101
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,620
Now Lazlo's spending his life in prison.

102
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,210
Jimmy only got five years.

103
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,670
Dave told me
he refused witness protection.

104
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,750
Protection? From...?

105
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,880
I'm sure Lazlo's son, Janni,
wants to put one of those...

106
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,800
You know, the... A price on his head.

107
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,970
You mean a contract?

108
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,220
A mob contract?

109
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,000
- Feeling better?
- Yes, thank you.

110
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,000
Good. Let's go for a drive.

111
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,510
- A drive? Why?
- Yeah, a drive.

112
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,380
Well, I don't know anyone else in town.

113
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,800
I figured we could go for a drive.

114
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,760
You could show me the sights,
you know.

115
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,600
It won't kill you.

116
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,690
Promise?

117
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,730
- So I take it you're not Canadian.
- Only by marriage.

118
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,190
- Where you from?
- Chicago.

119
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,450
Not "Chicago" Chicago.

120
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:06,660
I was born there, but I don't really
know anything about Chicago anymore.

121
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,080
Okay.

122
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,670
Yeah, totally oblivious
to anything even related to Chicago.

123
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,880
- I'm from Jersey.
- New Jersey?

124
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,090
Yeah. New Jersey.

125
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,470
If you're from Jersey,
you're from Jersey.

126
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,430
Jersey's another place
I know absolutely nothing about.

127
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,650
- You always this nervous?
- Yes.

128
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,480
Like virtually everything else
that's wrong in my life,

129
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,860
it all started with the little missus.

130
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:44,490
See, back home, her father and I
ran a dental practice together.

131
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,790
- You're a dentist?
- Afraid so.

132
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:52,370
- You suicidal?
- See, now, why would you say that?

133
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,790
I once read
that dentists are prone to suicide.

134
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Look, Jimmy, I may hate my life,
but I certainly don't wanna die.

135
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,220
You better get used to it
because you're going to.

136
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,300
I'm gonna kill you!
I'm gonna strangle you!

137
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,930
Everybody dies.

138
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,350
Sooner or later.

139
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,600
- Tulip?
- No!

140
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,360
So you were saying,
your father-in-law...

141
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:24,030
Well, ironically, he was a suicide.

142
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,320
Stats don't lie.

143
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:28,070
He got caught molesting a patient.

144
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,830
An underage patient.

145
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,660
An underage male patient.

146
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,160
- Please, stop.
- I know.

147
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,370
So this kid starts to blackmail him.

148
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:40,420
This is the exact same time the IRS
decides to investigate him for tax fraud.

149
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,420
So big Aaron needs money, and fast.

150
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:45,300
So he goes to a...
You know, a loan shark,

151
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:49,680
takes out a sizable loan against our
company, which I had no idea about.

152
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:52,390
- And then proceeds to...
- Hit Vegas, Atlantic City, Reno.

153
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,980
Loses all the money and sticks
you with the bill. Am I right?

154
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,810
You are right. That's exactly right.

155
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:05,070
So, you know, after the ensuing scandal
and bankruptcy and embarrassment,

156
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:10,030
my wife and her mother decided
it would be best that we move back here.

157
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,620
You like living in Canada?

158
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,410
No, I live here with my wife.

159
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,000
You sure you're a dentist?

160
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,683
Yeah, why?

161
00:14:22,804 --> 00:14:25,211
Because I've never
met a dentist I liked.

162
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,800
Well, I try to keep things
as painless as possible.

163
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,390
Me too.

164
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,070
Hey.

165
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:49,360
It's been good.
I'm glad we got to know each other.

166
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,200
You know what? Me too.

167
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,160
- You can go now.
- Great.

168
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,250
- Oz!
- Yes, dear?

169
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,000
Thank God you're home.

170
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:06,210
- Thank God I'm home?
- I had an idea.

171
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,010
I figured out a way
we can pay off Daddy's debt.

172
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,840
You're getting a job.

173
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,510
- No.
- No.

174
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,720
Our new neighbor.
You said there was a price on his head?

175
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:18,850
That's your plan?
You're gonna murder our neighbor?

176
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:22,520
Here's what you're going to do.
You're going to Chicago,

177
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:26,570
you're going to find out who it is
who's offering this price on his head.

178
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,820
Jimmy Tudeski's head?

179
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,610
Then you're going to tell them
you know where he is

180
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,030
after you negotiate a finder's fee.

181
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,870
A finder's fee on a murder contract.

182
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,450
- Is there a problem?
- Other than the fact

183
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,080
that would make me a party to a murder?

184
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,130
But he's a killer. You said so yourself.

185
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,130
That's another good
reason not to do it. Okay?

186
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,510
He's been to prison,
he's paid his debt to society.

187
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:53,050
Well, now he can pay our debt too.

188
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:56,890
All right, look,
I know this is gonna sound crazy,

189
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,890
but I spent some time
with the guy today, and he's...

190
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,690
He's pretty nice, you know.

191
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,850
Besides, he hasn't done anything to me.

192
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,730
- He came on to me.
- What?

193
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,280
He came on to me!

194
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:12,240
- That animal, he made a pass at me!
- When?

195
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,240
Earlier. This morning.
Before you came home.

196
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,830
He sa... He said
you guys haven't even met.

197
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,120
Who are you going to believe?
A contract killer or your wife?

198
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,210
Do I have to answer that?

199
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,000
- Nicolas!
- Okay, okay.

200
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:28,590
Let's say that he did
make a pass at you.

201
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,000
The guy's been in prison for five years.
He's desperate.

202
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,840
He'd sleep with a meat grinder.

203
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,350
You pig! You disgust me!

204
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:39,060
There's a known killer
living right next door

205
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,600
who might slaughter us in our sleep,
and you won't even lift a finger!

206
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:46,690
That's right. I'm not gonna lift
a finger because this is crazy.

207
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,200
You do this for me...

208
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,920
and I give you your divorce.

209
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,340
And if you don't do
this for me, I swear

210
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,590
I'll make your life
so damned miserable,

211
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,970
it'll make these past few years
seem like a pleasure cruise.

212
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,640
I already booked your flight.

213
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,970
You leave tomorrow at 9 a.m.

214
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,850
You better start packing.

215
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,310
Ho-ho-hew. Bing! Zoom!

216
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,820
<i>Okay. When are you coming back?</i>

217
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,620
I have to reschedule
all your appointments.

218
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,420
Shouldn't be more than a couple of days.

219
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,700
- Are you going alone?
<i>- Yes.</i>

220
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,620
Good. Can you do me a huge favor
while you're there?

221
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,920
Go out and get laid.

222
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,840
Jill.

223
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:52,000
Call me the second you get back.

224
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:55,670
Better yet, call me right after.
Call me during. I want all the details.

225
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,390
Now, don't expect too much.

226
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,310
I'm not even sure I'll be able
to contact these people.

227
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,570
It's not as if the Gogolaks
have a 1-800 number or anything.

228
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,740
I know you'll do what you can.

229
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,910
- What is this?
- Good luck, my darling.

230
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,750
And hurry home.

231
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,040
Do they have vomit bags on the flight?

232
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,200
You're Jimmy Tudeski, aren't you?
Jimmy the Tulip?

233
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,830
Don't worry,
your secret's safe with me, sexy.

234
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:14,250
But you will never believe
what my darling husband is up to.

235
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,600
You're back in Chicago?

236
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:36,190
Great. Tell you what, meet me
at Ekins Oyster Bar in 45 minutes.

237
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,780
Dave, you got nothing to worry about.

238
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,030
How can I not worry?

239
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,580
You tell me you're back in Chicago
to rat Tudeski out to Janni...

240
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,580
But I'm not going to rat him out.
You think I'm suicidal?

241
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,250
Well, you are a dentist.

242
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,880
Look, I have no intention
of ratting anybody out, okay?

243
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:01,610
The only reason I'm here is because I want
Sophie off my back if you wanna know the truth.

244
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,350
All right, look,
I've got a deadline.

245
00:20:03,371 --> 00:20:05,808
I'll come by your hotel room
as soon as I'm finished.

246
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,160
In the meantime,
promise me you won't do anything stupid.

247
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:11,810
- Now, why would you even say that?
- You married Sophie, didn't you?

248
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,440
So I'll get the check then?

249
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:33,960
- I'm sorry. I must have the wrong...
- What room you looking for?

250
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,920
Five-nineteen.

251
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,260
You're in the right place.

252
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,920
You Nicholas Oseransky?

253
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:46,010
- Who are you?
- We understand you have information

254
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,810
regarding the whereabouts
of Jimmy the Tulip.

255
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:52,270
- Who told you that? Dave?
- Who's Dave?

256
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,730
What did he tell you?

257
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,100
Forget about Dave.

258
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,940
For our immediate purposes,
there is no Dave.

259
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,980
Dave does not exist.

260
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:03,490
So just answer my question.

261
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,450
Do you or don't you?

262
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:10,740
Have information regarding
the whereabouts of Jimmy the Tulip?

263
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,688
I don't know what
you're talking about, man.

264
00:21:14,709 --> 00:21:15,520
Really?

265
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:21,090
Then I must have been misinformed.

266
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,590
I apologize.

267
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,130
It's okay.

268
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,430
Now, let's try this again.

269
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,440
We understand

270
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,730
- you have information regarding...
- Who told you that?

271
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,400
Why do you wanna go cluttering
your mind with the inconsequential?

272
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:46,530
What's important is we know
that you know where Jimmy Tudeski is.

273
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,660
Look, I really have no...

274
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,620
Aren't you gonna cry out for help?

275
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,540
- Would it do any good?
- No.

276
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,380
- Who are you?
- Franklin Figueroa.

277
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,000
A.k.a. Frankie Figs.

278
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:02,670
I work for Janni Gogolak.

279
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:04,720
Oh, my god.

280
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,260
So, where's Jimmy?

281
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,600
Look, I sw...

282
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:15,770
My brother, believe me,
you don't wanna dance with me all night.

283
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,190
And for a scumbag like Jimmy T?

284
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,980
Save yourself the pain.

285
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,320
Look, I really have no...

286
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,150
No, no, no!

287
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,410
I may know where he is.

288
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:32,120
Well, all right. But don't tell me.
Let's go tell Janni.

289
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:35,040
Okay.
You mind if I piss a little blood first?

290
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,410
- Please, by all means.
- Thanks.

291
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,280
My father...

292
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,160
is a great man.

293
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,710
A man of vision and...

294
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,800
character.

295
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,970
A man who stood up for his beliefs.

296
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,810
Unlike that rat-fuck...

297
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,180
piece of shit...

298
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,350
Tudeski.

299
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,690
Can you...

300
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:51,740
ask Cynthia to join us, please?

301
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,410
- You want a drink?
- No, thanks.

302
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,370
- Have a drink.
- I'll have a Scotch and soda, please.

303
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,380
I want you to understand,
Frankie explained to me

304
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:11,590
you're having a problem
with your conscience.

305
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,800
Yes, well, it's just that
none of this was my idea.

306
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,720
You think it was mine? No.

307
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:20,230
If I had my way, my father

308
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:24,150
would still be running things
and I'd be somewhere like...

309
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,770
I don't know.

310
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:37,700
- Aruba.
- Actually, Aruba's not that nice.

311
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:42,750
- Excuse me?
- You may like it.

312
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,840
See, I honeymooned there, and
that's probably why I didn't like it.

313
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,800
The thing you gotta remember is

314
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,590
when we're talking about Jimmy Tudeski,

315
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,720
we're not talking about a human being.

316
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:59,100
We're talking about a rodent.

317
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,560
We're talking about...

318
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,440
wermin.

319
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:16,570
- Where was I?
- Wermin. I think wermin.

320
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:19,870
We're talking about
someone... Screw that!

321
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:22,870
Something...

322
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,870
that doesn't deserve to be breathing...

323
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,290
the air.

324
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,670
Janni, talking about yourself again?

325
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:35,300
Mr. Oseransky...

326
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,220
this is Cynthia.

327
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,350
Jimmy's wife.

328
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:57,610
- Cynthia, it seems that Mr...
- Doctor.

329
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:00,530
Excuse me?

330
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,700
Dr. Oseransky. He's a dentist.

331
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,040
Whatever.

332
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:10,090
It seems that our dentist friend here
knows where Jimmy is.

333
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,460
- Come to collect on the contract?
- No.

334
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:18,640
Janni, just so you know, since I'm
the one that found this guy, I want it.

335
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,600
- The contract's mine.
- Just as long as I'm in on the kill.

336
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,350
So long as I get full price.

337
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:27,310
I wanna see that spineless rat beg.

338
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,310
Money doesn't matter.

339
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,650
Well, now I've heard everything.
Don't you believe it.

340
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:37,070
This one? Kill you for a quarter.

341
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,660
Mr. Oseransky,

342
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:45,450
Frankie will accompany you
back to Canada.

343
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:49,710
You will lead him to the man
you believe is Jimmy Tudeski.

344
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,340
- But, sir...
- Frankie, you'll let me know?

345
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,340
All right then.

346
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,840
Mr... Mr. Gogolak.

347
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,850
My wife would make my life
even more miserable

348
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,680
than it already is
if I didn't at least ask.

349
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,900
Is there gonna be any kind
of finder's fee for this?

350
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:19,530
Finder's fee?

351
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,670
I tell you what.

352
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,340
Tell your wife
we'll work something out.

353
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:53,480
Cynthia, don't rush off.

354
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,690
We should chat a little.

355
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,990
I'll call you in the morning.
We'll leave first thing.

356
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,370
Doctor. You're not gonna do
anything stupid

357
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,710
like try leaving me in the lurch,
are you?

358
00:28:13,731 --> 00:28:14,840
No.

359
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:20,670
- What did you do? Who did you talk to?
- What are you talking about?

360
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,300
- You know a guy named Frankie Figs?
<i>- I know of him.</i>

361
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:26,720
Yeah, well, when I came back from lunch,
he was sitting in my room.

362
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:29,060
- Frankie Figs was in your room?
<i>- Yes.</i>

363
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:31,770
And somehow he knew all about
my knowing where Jimmy is.

364
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,980
<i>- And what did he do?</i>
- After he played congas on my kidneys,

365
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:38,440
- he took me to see Janni Gogolak.
- Oz, tell me you're kidding me.

366
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,360
Who did you tell?
I wanna know exactly who you told.

367
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,910
- No one, I swear.
- Well, then, how...?

368
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:48,410
What am I gonna do?

369
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:51,250
I'll talk to you later. I gotta go.

370
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:12,603
<i>Room service.</i>

371
00:29:12,624 --> 00:29:15,120
Yes,
this is Dr. Oseransky in Room 519.

372
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,520
I'm gonna need
a bigger bottle of Scotch.

373
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:32,580
- Yeah.
- It's me.

374
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:35,120
Oz. How you doing?

375
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,420
I don't know what to do.

376
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:37,806
I've done something terrible.

377
00:29:37,827 --> 00:29:39,650
Come on. Oz,
what could be so terrible?

378
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,800
<i>You've gotta get out of town, get out
of Canada. Just get the hell out.</i>

379
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:46,340
<i>- I'm in... I'm in Chicago.</i>
- Yeah, I heard about that.

380
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,050
Have you seen Janni yet?

381
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:54,100
- How did you know that?
- Relax.

382
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,650
I know about the whole thing, okay?
Don't worry.

383
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:59,270
- But...
<i>- I'll explain everything</i>

384
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,400
to you when you get back, okay?

385
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,240
In the meantime,

386
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,360
I want you to have a good time
while you're down there. Live it up.

387
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:09,200
- No, but what...
- We'll talk when you get back.

388
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,240
<i>If you say so, Jim...</i>

389
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,660
Are you gonna invite me in
or am I going downstairs

390
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:51,830
and tell Janni's guys
you're being impolite?

391
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:54,240
Janni's guys are downstairs?

392
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,000
Yes, come in.

393
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,420
I love a man with manners.

394
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:15,310
Janni sent me to see if you were
on the level. Janni's the trusting type.

395
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,020
So do you or don't you?

396
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,400
Do I or don't I...?

397
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,570
Know where my wayward husband is.

398
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,280
Mrs. Tudeski...

399
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,630
Cynthia. Why be formal with a woman
you're about to widow?

400
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:31,240
- You don't understand.
- What's not to understand?

401
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:34,530
You want your 30 pieces of silver,
right? My question is

402
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,200
- why didn't you just do the job?
- Why didn't I...?

403
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,710
Why didn't you kill Jimmy
and try to collect on the contract?

404
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:44,040
What's the matter?
You didn't have the stomach for it?

405
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:47,550
Or is your problem
a little further south?

406
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:52,510
- Have you vomited recently?
- A minute ago.

407
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,890
I was just gonna brush my teeth.

408
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:55,600
- I'll wait.
- Okay.

409
00:31:56,810 --> 00:32:00,640
Mrs. Tudeski.
Cynthia, none of this was my idea.

410
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:04,400
You just happened to travel a thousand
miles to rat Jimmy out to Janni.

411
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:07,980
No. See, that's what I'm trying to say.
It was my wife's plan.

412
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:10,820
She wanted me to come to Chicago
and rat Jimmy out.

413
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,410
Look, maybe it would be best
for everybody if you went to Janni

414
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:19,000
and said that I'm crazy, I've gone nuts.
I'm chemically imbalanced.

415
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,790
I'm wacko.

416
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,790
Maybe that would be the best thing.

417
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,420
Because...

418
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:36,260
Just tell him I'm acting
exactly the way I'm acting right now.

419
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,220
But you do know where Jimmy is,
don't you?

420
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:45,190
Look, Mrs. Tudeski,
I don't want anybody to die.

421
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,480
And that is on the level.

422
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,860
- What do you want?
- What do I want?

423
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,910
I just want this all to end.

424
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,210
I am so damn scared.

425
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,600
That's room service.
Before I vomited, I ordered Scotch.

426
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,140
There you go.

427
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,060
Thank you.

428
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:30,110
What would you say to a drink?

429
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,570
I'd say no ice,
no water, in a tall glass.

430
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:38,370
What can I say? I was young.

431
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,990
Jimmy was like no
man I'd ever met before.

432
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,210
Yeah, well,
he's the first killer I've known.

433
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:48,670
No one like him at my daddy's
country club. Lousy husband, though.

434
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,630
Cheated on me constantly.

435
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,380
- So why didn't you just...?
- Divorce him?

436
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:57,680
Jimmy doesn't believe in divorce.
Thinks it's a sin.

437
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,350
I know. A hit man
with morals. Go figure.

438
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,980
So now that he's out of prison,

439
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:07,270
are you guys gonna get back together?

440
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,320
You mean assuming Frankie and Janni
don't kill him first?

441
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,480
No.

442
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,650
Jimmy and I are over.

443
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,410
And even if I wanted to make
another go of it, which I don't,

444
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:21,280
there'd always be that other thing
between us.

445
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,790
What other thing?

446
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:28,210
- The fact that he wants to kill me.
- Why?

447
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,460
You're a sweet guy. Money.

448
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:37,260
- Are... Are... Are you rich?
- The money Lazlo Gogolak gave us

449
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:40,800
as a wedding present.
Only it wasn't a wedding present.

450
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:43,570
Lazlo was just parking the money
with us to hide it from the feds.

451
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:46,600
- How much was it?
- Ten million dollars.

452
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:50,020
Hell of a parking space.

453
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:53,730
The only way anyone could get the money
was if Jimmy and Janni and I

454
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,690
all signed for it together.

455
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:59,910
If you didn't have all three signatures,
you'd need two signatures.

456
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:02,030
And a death certificate.

457
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,450
- Or one signature and...
- Two death certificates.

458
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:08,990
That's why Jimmy wants to kill you,
if he kills you...

459
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,130
- Let's not forget about Janni.
- ...then he gets the money. All of it.

460
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,710
The whole nine yards.

461
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:20,260
What if you just told him
you didn't want the money?

462
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:27,640
I did tell him. I don't want a dime. But
he knows I don't wanna be married anymore

463
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,190
and he doesn't believe in divorce.

464
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:32,190
- But murder he's okay with?
- It's what he does.

465
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:35,610
Well, if it was me,
10 million wouldn't be enough.

466
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:38,610
So how much would it take
for you to kill your wife?

467
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:42,320
- I'm talking about you.
- Me then. Your price?

468
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:45,740
That's what I'm saying. I think
you are the most beautiful thing

469
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:49,660
I have ever seen in my life, and I
cannot believe I am saying this out loud.

470
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:52,464
I'm sure that's just
the Scotch talking.

471
00:35:52,485 --> 00:35:53,560
No, it's me.

472
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:01,010
I've spent the last seven years of my
life just waiting for something to happen.

473
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,890
I didn't even know what it was.

474
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:08,310
Until you walked in that room
at Janni Gogolak's house.

475
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,980
I'm sorry. I've embarrassed you.

476
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,360
- I should go.
- No.

477
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:16,900
Please.

478
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,360
You're a nice guy,

479
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,360
but I've gotta go.

480
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,370
Let's go.

481
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:39,960
You know, the night's still young.
You boys in any rush to get back?

482
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,260
Did you mean what you said?

483
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,850
I've got till midnight.

484
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,310
In the meantime...

485
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,040
- Promise me something.
- Anything.

486
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,500
You'll go slow.

487
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,410
- I haven't made love in five years.
- Neither have I.

488
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,500
I've been married.

489
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,350
It's almost time.

490
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:35,730
Again?

491
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,150
What, did you have oysters for lunch?

492
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,820
Actually, I did.

493
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:46,860
Jimmy knows I'm here.

494
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:49,740
- Here with me?
- Here in Chicago.

495
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,450
Talking with Janni.

496
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,790
How? How did he know that?

497
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,420
- Because I told him.
- You what?

498
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:59,670
He already knew.

499
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,380
- How?
- Well, I'm guessing my darling wife.

500
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:04,630
- Is she trying to get you killed?
- Apparently.

501
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,360
That's the only thing
I can come up with.

502
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:08,890
But when I talked to Jimmy, he...

503
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:12,470
- He didn't sound upset.
- No, he wouldn't.

504
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,310
He'd be your best friend
right up until the moment he...

505
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:19,560
He's gonna kill me, isn't he?

506
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:23,650
And then, when he's done with that,
he's gonna come after you.

507
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,450
I'm not gonna let that happen.

508
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:29,240
I'm not gonna let Jimmy kill you.
I'm gonna take Frankie to Canada

509
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,180
- and lead him to Jimmy.
- So Frankie can kill him.

510
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,540
Believe me, if there was any other way,
but better Jimmy than you, right?

511
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,500
But, Oz, don't you get it?
Either way, I'm dead.

512
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,670
- Why? Why?
- As soon as Jimmy's dead,

513
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,000
why would Janni wanna keep me alive?

514
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,550
- He'd wanna kill me too so...
- So he can collect

515
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,930
on the whole $10 million.

516
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:52,760
Well, I'm not gonna let that happen.

517
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:56,270
I swear, I am not gonna
let anybody kill you.

518
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:01,980
Under the circumstances, that's probably
the most romantic thing I've ever heard.

519
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,520
Thanks. Ahem.

520
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,340
You what?

521
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,720
You told Jimmy?

522
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:32,720
What the hell did you do that for?

523
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:36,020
I felt bad. I like him. I liked him.

524
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:39,000
- So you don't like him no more?
- A little hard to maintain a friendship

525
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,563
with somebody
who wants to kill you.

526
00:39:40,584 --> 00:39:42,710
If you sold my ass out,
then told me about it,

527
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:45,900
- I'd wanna ice your ass too.
- I know.

528
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,700
- You know, I can close that gap for you.
- Really?

529
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:53,780
- You'd be in and out. No, not a problem.
- You're kidding.

530
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,910
So did you do it?
Did you do what I told you to do?

531
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,790
No. No, I'm not gonna answer that.

532
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,420
So you did.

533
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:03,750
<i>- I can tell. You had sex.</i>
- Full-size car, please.

534
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,670
- Who is she? I wanna hear all about it.
- I gotta go.

535
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,550
- Emergencies, I got my beeper on.
<i>- Fine, be that way.</i>

536
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,140
- I don't need no insurance.
<i>- The bitch called.</i>

537
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,550
<i>Said she and her mom
went to Niagara Falls.</i>

538
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,140
Yeah. Probably working on her alibi.
I gotta go.

539
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,350
Why don't you drive back to the hotel
with me?

540
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,480
Unless you'd rather go
home in broad daylight

541
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:26,900
with Jimmy right next door.

542
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:29,360
Yeah, I'll go with you.

543
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,690
Frankie Figs.

544
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:09,360
Jimmy T.

545
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:23,750
What's going on? What's up, baby?

546
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,460
- How are you?
- What's up? Welcome to Montreal.

547
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:29,550
- What's up? Good to see you.
- You're looking good.

548
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,550
Oz, you look worried.

549
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,550
- Doesn't he look worried?
- He does.

550
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,180
Why don't you relax?

551
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:40,220
Come on, Frankie told me
what a standup guy you've been.

552
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:44,310
Now change your pants.
We're going out.

553
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:15,220
I'm gonna keep the Coke and the fries,
but I'm gonna send this burger back.

554
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:18,260
And if you put any mayonnaise on it,

555
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:22,010
I'm gonna chop your legs off,
set your house on fire,

556
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:26,890
and watch as you drag your bloody stumps
out of your house. Okay, Pierre?

557
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:29,110
I'm fine.

558
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:30,770
You're fine?

559
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:35,150
Let me tell you something, Oz.
You are not fine.

560
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,110
You know your wife wants you dead.

561
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:40,240
That much I've figured out.

562
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:43,740
And you should know because
I'm not the first one she came to.

563
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:45,250
- The first?
- Hitter.

564
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:47,330
- There were others?
- At least one.

565
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:50,080
Apparently, that fell through,
so she came to me.

566
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:53,550
What did you tell her?

567
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,470
You mean, did I take the contract?

568
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:12,860
No. I didn't take the contract.

569
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:15,030
- How much did she offer you?
- Ten grand.

570
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:21,280
No wonder you turned her down.

571
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:23,120
But you did turn her down.

572
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:24,990
Even though I went to Janni?

573
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,540
You didn't go to Janni.

574
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,710
Jimmy sent me to come to you.

575
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,750
And I know that Frankie
can be very persuasive.

576
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,760
- By the way, how's your urination?
- Fine. Thank you.

577
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,970
So why did you want me
to go see Janni?

578
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:39,920
So you could tell
him where I was.

579
00:43:39,941 --> 00:43:42,240
So he'd come here
and you could kill him?

580
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:43,510
Exacto.

581
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,430
By the way,
I'd be happy to do your wife.

582
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,770
- Do my wife?
- Tap her.

583
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:50,270
- Tap her? Whack her.
- Whack her.

584
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,770
See, I thought you meant, you know:

585
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:57,190
Because she told me
that you, you know, hit on her.

586
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:01,450
That's funny.

587
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:03,240
Why is that funny?

588
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,080
No, I...

589
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:11,620
I actually wasn't gonna tell you this,
but the truth is, your wife came on to me.

590
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:17,000
- And?
- Oz, we're friends.

591
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:19,840
Friends do not engage
in sexual congress

592
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:21,260
with each other's wives.

593
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:28,270
Besides, I don't find your wife
particularly that attractive.

594
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:30,270
- You just got out of prison.
- Yeah.

595
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,850
Been in prison for five years
and don't find my wife attractive?

596
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,730
She's not a good person.

597
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:43,200
You've killed 17 people, and you
don't think my wife is a good person?

598
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:49,450
It's not important
how many people I've killed.

599
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:54,420
What's important is how I get along
with the people that are still alive.

600
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,680
- You gonna finish this?
- Just take it.

601
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,500
I think we've given it long enough.

602
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:35,540
Give Janni a call.
The sooner he gets here, the better.

603
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:38,790
So after you kill Janni,
you're gonna go back to Chicago?

604
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,550
No, I'm done with Chicago.

605
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:44,510
What about your wife?
You're gonna get back together with her?

606
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:48,760
You're gonna kill her too?

607
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:51,430
For a hell of a lot more than $10,000.

608
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,140
- Well, you can't do that.
- Why not?

609
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:55,770
Because she's your wife.

610
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,650
- Damn.
- You were right about him.

611
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,690
This is one exceedingly sweet man.

612
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:02,610
Wife like he got
and still believes in wedding vows.

613
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,950
So do I. Especially
till death do us part.

614
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:09,200
Oh, god. It's my beeper.
I... I gotta go to the office.

615
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,080
Well, wedding vows or not...

616
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,540
I'd watch my back.

617
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,330
I'd say your wife's still shopping
for a hitter.

618
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:19,130
Good luck.

619
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:50,030
On second thought, Mr. Tourette, I think
we're gonna have to pull the tooth.

620
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:06,970
Oz, what is it? What's the matter?

621
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:14,350
No, Oz. No, no. Oz, I'll take that. Oz.

622
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:20,730
- I am your friend. Talk to me.
- Well, I have to talk to somebody

623
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:23,320
- because I'm just... Gonna just...
- Take your time.

624
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:30,740
That's good.

625
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:35,410
Well, first of all, I just found out
that my wife is trying to have me killed.

626
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:37,790
- Who told you?
- A friend.

627
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,500
- Anyone I know?
- He's my next-door neighbor.

628
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:43,420
And here's the funny part.
He's a hit man too.

629
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:45,170
Really? What's his name?

630
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:47,670
Jimmy. Jimmy Tudeski.

631
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:49,840
Jimmy the Tulip?

632
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:54,010
Jimmy the Tulip lives next to you
and you know him?

633
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:56,100
Oz, can you introduce me to him?

634
00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:00,520
Jill. The man is a professional killer.

635
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:03,560
You don't understand.
I've been wanting to meet this guy.

636
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:05,320
Please, Oz. Come on.

637
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:09,360
Oz.

638
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:11,030
Quick, come on.

639
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:18,200
- What's this, Oz?
- I don't know.

640
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:19,870
It is you.

641
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,960
Mr. Tudeski, you don't understand.

642
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:26,340
I'm one of your biggest fans. I've been
following your career since I was a kid.

643
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:29,260
You're the reason
I'm trying to get into the business.

644
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:34,550
- What business would that be?
- Contract killing. It's what I wanna do.

645
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:39,180
And if I could just have one afternoon,
I know I could learn so much from you.

646
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:43,440
So come in.

647
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,320
You too.

648
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,080
- What's all this?
- You know this girl?

649
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:02,460
- She's my assistant.
- You know she was a hitter?

650
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:05,830
Actually, I'm still a virgin.
I haven't killed anyone yet.

651
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,130
Professionally.

652
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:09,460
- Oz was supposed to be first.
- Excuse me?

653
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:11,420
- His wife hired me.
- That was you?

654
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:15,510
I was supposed to make it an accident,
work for him so I familiarize myself

655
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,680
- with his habits, know him.
- Smart.

656
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:21,770
Thanks. But then after I got to
know him, I started to like him.

657
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:24,400
- First mistake.
- I know.

658
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,360
You should get close,
but not too close.

659
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:31,440
- Go pour yourself a martini.
- It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon.

660
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:41,700
Don't give yourself too hard a time.
Got your career ahead of you.

661
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:46,080
I remember when I was starting out.
I hadn't really done that much.

662
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:50,670
Done a couple things, saw some money,
having fun. I was doing something I liked.

663
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,920
Then I was recruited by Lazlo Gogolak,

664
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:57,850
and first thing he wanted me to do
was whack out one of his cousins.

665
00:49:58,050 --> 00:50:00,680
- Is this the Stanley Posilansky incident?
- Yeah.

666
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:05,810
Anyway, Lazlo doesn't want it
to look like a hit, right?

667
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:10,320
So, now, I've gotta get close to Stanley,
who was this really charming, cute,

668
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:13,780
funny little guy, very weird
sense of humor, made me laugh.

669
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,990
I really liked him as a person.
You know what I mean?

670
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,410
You got too close.

671
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:29,380
Yeah, I got too close.

672
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,510
Moment of truth comes...

673
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:35,920
- Choked.
- Him?

674
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:38,050
Me. I choked.

675
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:40,550
Couldn't do it. I actually...

676
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,640
I... I told him
I was there to kill him.

677
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:47,440
Can you believe that? I said,
"Run, Stanley, run. Go, go. Run. Hide.

678
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,810
Off you go."

679
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:53,860
We shake hands, part as friends,
turn around and walk away.

680
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:56,860
This little weasel shoots me
in the back

681
00:50:57,070 --> 00:51:00,070
and the bullet comes out right here.

682
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:04,910
- So, what did you do?
- I didn't really like Stanley after that.

683
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,330
He took a really,
really long time to die.

684
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:14,340
And this scar is a reminder.

685
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,050
Never get too close.

686
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:19,550
Can...?

687
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,440
Excuse me.

688
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:34,820
Excuse me.

689
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:39,320
Not to interrupt or anything,
but you were gonna kill me?

690
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:40,740
That was the plan?

691
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:46,410
- What are you doing tonight?
- No plans.

692
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:50,120
Wanna help us out?
Me and Frankie Figs?

693
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,040
Wait. Are you offering me a job?

694
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,630
Only if you're interested.

695
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:03,640
It would be an honor. It would be, like,
a dream come true. Who's the mark?

696
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:06,430
Janni Gogo.

697
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:08,810
Janni Gogo?

698
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:14,900
Feel my arm. Goose bumps.

699
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:16,940
Phone!

700
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:19,280
Your phone scared me.

701
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:21,950
There it is again.

702
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:25,530
- What is wrong with you?
- I don't know.

703
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,410
Yeah? Frankie.

704
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,710
Okay, good. See you soon.

705
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:37,550
- Good news?
- Great news.

706
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:42,340
Apparently, Janni Gogo is on his way up
here and he's bringing my wife with him.

707
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:44,970
- Your wife?
- Your wi...? He's go...?

708
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:47,890
- Why?
- Janni figures he'll take care of her

709
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:51,890
- when he takes care of me.
- So, what are you gonna do? Save her?

710
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:53,980
No. I want her dead too.

711
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:56,900
- Really?
- Yeah. You got a problem with that?

712
00:52:57,110 --> 00:53:00,570
- Why would I? It's not like I know her.
- I can't believe you people.

713
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:05,160
You are calmly talking about the murder
of a beautiful innocent woman

714
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:08,040
whose only crime
is that she married you, Jimmy.

715
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,870
So you know what?
Not gonna listen to this anymore.

716
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:12,870
You know what I'm gonna do?

717
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,120
I'm gonna...

718
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,040
I'm gonna...

719
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,340
I'm gonna go.

720
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,260
I'm gonna...

721
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,550
Does this slide? Wha...?

722
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,340
Answer that.

723
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,760
That's my phone, thank you.

724
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:12,020
Hello?

725
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:16,940
- Well, who was it?
- They hung up.

726
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:18,400
Expecting a call?

727
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:21,610
Explain to me
how that's any of your business.

728
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:23,030
Get her bag.

729
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:25,490
Plane's waiting and I'm not.

730
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:05,360
Oh, my god.

731
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,910
You don't like the Walther?

732
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,120
You go what you're comfortable with.

733
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:19,210
- It's what James Bond uses.
- Really?

734
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:22,040
- Yeah.
- Still, I like to buy American.

735
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,020
Is there any way I can stop you
from doing this?

736
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,440
Oz, will you relax?
I promise you no one is gonna know

737
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:45,280
- you had anything to do.
- That's not the point.

738
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:48,280
- What is the point?
- You're still gonna kill your wife.

739
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:49,950
Well?

740
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:53,780
Yeah.

741
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:57,500
I've got a very good reason
to kill my wife.

742
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:02,130
About 10 million very good reasons
to kill my wife.

743
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:04,670
Okay, well, what if I said no?

744
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:08,590
You know, what if I said
I wasn't gonna let you do it?

745
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:17,180
You know, you are
the most chivalrous guy I've ever met.

746
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:20,190
- Do you see why I couldn't kill him?
- I love him.

747
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:23,270
Oz, come on.

748
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,780
Relax. Come on over here,
sit down in your favorite chair,

749
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:29,110
have another martini.

750
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,360
Listen to me.

751
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:34,490
Tonight is gonna happen
whether you want it to or not.

752
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:36,160
And you're gonna help.

753
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:37,540
Me? Help?

754
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:39,620
Yeah. You help. You're gonna help.

755
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:42,330
You're gonna go with Frankie
to meet Janni,

756
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:46,340
because if not, Janni will get
suspicious, get back on the plane

757
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:49,010
- and fly to Chicago, we don't want that.
- Jimmy...

758
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:50,090
Oz...

759
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,220
this is the way it's gotta be, okay?

760
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:54,470
And...

761
00:56:55,970 --> 00:56:59,220
I'm telling you this like a friend
because if you...

762
00:56:59,430 --> 00:57:02,600
If you screw this up, I would hate to...

763
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,820
I would really hate to have to kill you.

764
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:12,280
I would hate it.
I hate it more than mayonnaise.

765
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:14,490
- You know how I hate mayonnaise.
- I do.

766
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:17,410
And besides, trust me,
you want Janni Gogolak dead.

767
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:20,370
No. You're wrong.
I don't want anybody dead.

768
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:24,120
If we don't make Janni Gogolak dead,
he's gonna make you dead.

769
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:26,590
Gogolaks do not like to leave witnesses.

770
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:28,250
So, now, we...

771
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:32,420
Damn it, Jimmy. Why the hell did you
have to go and move in next door to me?

772
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:37,300
Oz, do you know what kind of soil
they have in this backyard?

773
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:40,201
Been here two days.
I got a tomato plant...

774
00:57:40,222 --> 00:57:41,200
oh, my god.

775
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:46,900
Yes. Yes. Yes.

776
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:50,530
Yes. Yes. Yes.

777
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:53,950
- Hey, why did you stop?
- You doing it tonight?

778
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:56,450
Tonight, whenever,
go. Kick it into gear.

779
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:58,410
- For 10,000?
- Wait a minute.

780
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:02,000
- You said we were doing this for 15.
- I changed my mind.

781
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:05,080
But if you think I should go
and find somebody else...

782
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:06,790
No, no, no.

783
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,460
Listen, why don't we make it, 12,500?

784
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:15,550
I can live with 12,500.
As long as my husband doesn't.

785
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:16,970
He won't.

786
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:18,260
I promise.

787
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:22,180
- You must be...
- Jill St. Claire.

788
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:26,770
And can I just say, Mr. Figueroa, that I
think the job you did on Kevin Vincent,

789
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:30,110
that and the Ronald Abramson hit,
they were both just...

790
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,070
They were... They're works of art.

791
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:35,990
- Well, I see you've done your homework.
- Well, I keep a scrapbook.

792
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,240
Frankie.

793
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:40,120
- What's up, man?
- Honey, why don't you go get Oz?

794
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:43,160
We'll run through,
make sure we know what we're doing.

795
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:44,250
- Okay.
- Okay.

796
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,500
- She's a cute kid.
- Got definite potential.

797
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:00,850
Time to rock 'n' roll.

798
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:03,990
You know, I got this same car.

799
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,450
- Really?
- No.

800
01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:32,810
All right, nobody move.

801
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:38,030
Everybody quiet.

802
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:03,550
God, I'm gonna love this.

803
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:06,890
So, now what?

804
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:09,640
Now we wait until...

805
01:01:12,850 --> 01:01:14,020
he's asleep.

806
01:01:14,350 --> 01:01:15,360
Okay.

807
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:46,850
Sweet dreams, Jimmy.

808
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:49,350
Let's get started.

809
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:13,330
We got company.

810
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:21,960
Anybody we know?

811
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:24,050
Oz's wife and some guy.

812
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:27,550
Probably your
replacement. The new hitter.

813
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:31,220
Well, there's nothing we can do
about it now.

814
01:02:31,770 --> 01:02:33,810
- Keep an eye on them.
- Okay.

815
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:35,940
Love those pants on you.

816
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:38,940
So, what is he, a bad guy, your husband?

817
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:40,940
No.

818
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:43,940
Actually, everyone seems to like him.

819
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:47,530
Which might be the thing
I hate most about him.

820
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:51,530
- Let's go over this one more time...
- What the hell for?

821
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:54,290
I just wanna make sure
we got everything right.

822
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,540
Any particular way
you want him to die?

823
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,210
What do I care?

824
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:01,880
I'm out of the country,
shopping for my funeral dress.

825
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:06,630
Dentist, get the blinds.

826
01:03:11,390 --> 01:03:12,510
Today.

827
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:35,200
Oh, god. Of all the times...

828
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:38,790
- You're married?
- Yes.

829
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,040
Does your wife have any...?

830
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:43,840
Feminine products.

831
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:48,090
Yes, she does. They're right through
there. I'll show you where they are.

832
01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:52,010
Don't be long.

833
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:54,350
- "Don't blong"?
- Don't be long.

834
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:55,520
Gotcha.

835
01:03:57,180 --> 01:04:00,810
You make a noise, he gets out of bed
to see what the problem is,

836
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:04,110
and you make him dead, okay?
You understand me?

837
01:04:04,690 --> 01:04:05,940
The dead part?

838
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:10,740
Ransack the house so it looks like a
burglary, get your ass back in this car,

839
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:14,030
and we drive
like hell back to Niagara Falls.

840
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:16,870
Where you're gonna pay me
my other $5000.

841
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:18,660
My mother's there waiting with it.

842
01:04:19,870 --> 01:04:22,080
Wait. Your mother, she knows about this?

843
01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:24,920
My mother wants this to happen
as much as I do.

844
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:28,590
And I really,
really want this to happen.

845
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:33,740
- They're gonna kill you. What?
- They're gonna kill you. What?

846
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:38,060
When they're done with Jimmy, Janni will
come after you. I came so I can warn you.

847
01:04:38,270 --> 01:04:39,430
That is...

848
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:45,770
Janni's not gonna kill anyone.
Jimmy's waiting for them.

849
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:47,900
Jimmy and Frankie are in, you know...

850
01:04:48,110 --> 01:04:49,150
- Cahoots.
- Right.

851
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:52,280
- Are you cahooting?
- I had to pretend I was cahooting.

852
01:04:52,490 --> 01:04:55,200
But, listen, I have a plan.

853
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:01,410
It's time. You two stay here.

854
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:14,140
Hey, you know these guys?

855
01:05:15,970 --> 01:05:17,010
No.

856
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:18,970
- Hey.
- Who is that?

857
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:26,230
- Is that Janni Gogolak?
- From the Gogolak gang.

858
01:05:26,650 --> 01:05:30,070
It might be. The guy they called
Jimmy the Tulip lives next door.

859
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:34,990
Jimmy the Tulip? Damn!
This is a hit. Stay right here!

860
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:49,880
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

861
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:52,840
You smell great.

862
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,510
<i>Shoot!</i>

863
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:01,520
<i>All right, you got a gun now.
You gonna use it or not?</i>

864
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:02,890
<i>Kill him, major.</i>

865
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:05,810
<i>Yeah, kill him, major.</i>

866
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:07,900
<i>Show him
how you're not afraid to die.</i>

867
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:09,690
<i>Shoot!</i>

868
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:21,330
<i>Looks like you don't want it enough,
what you want.</i>

869
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:27,210
<i>He laughs when something's
funny for a change.</i>

870
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:30,590
<i>One Rocco more or less
isn't worth dying for.</i>

871
01:06:41,390 --> 01:06:44,230
Hi. Are you guys looking for someone?

872
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:56,820
Hi, Janni.

873
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:57,910
Watch your head.

874
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:17,760
This whole sneaking-into-the-house thing
to try to kill me?

875
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:23,680
You guys are really good.
You're really... Bye, Janni.

876
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:51,460
What's going on?

877
01:07:51,630 --> 01:07:54,630
Oz took off with your wife
and Sophie's hitter is outside.

878
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:56,630
All right, I'll take care of it.

879
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,260
You should get dressed.

880
01:07:59,470 --> 01:08:02,350
You know what?
Better yet, stay just like that.

881
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:05,180
In 60 seconds,
stick your head out that window.

882
01:08:07,730 --> 01:08:08,810
Hey.

883
01:08:10,230 --> 01:08:11,310
Nice work.

884
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:14,320
- Thanks, Jimmy.
<i>- Will we see you again, Frank?</i>

885
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:17,070
<i>- I hope so.</i>
- Be right back.

886
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:22,450
You know, I can't think of nothing finer
than a fine naked woman holding a gun.

887
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:24,950
And you just all kinds of fine,
ain't you?

888
01:08:25,990 --> 01:08:27,200
Don't get any ideas.

889
01:08:29,830 --> 01:08:32,000
Seriously sweet ass.

890
01:08:39,630 --> 01:08:40,880
Can I help you?

891
01:08:56,730 --> 01:08:58,230
Now you can get dressed.

892
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:00,190
Okay.

893
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:15,590
Here we go. Where do you want this?

894
01:09:15,790 --> 01:09:17,840
- Just put it over there.
- All right.

895
01:09:25,470 --> 01:09:27,720
What was Oz doing
going off with my wife?

896
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:31,480
- I can beep him. You can ask him.
- Beep him.

897
01:09:32,270 --> 01:09:34,150
Now, ain't this some shit?

898
01:09:37,770 --> 01:09:41,320
Maybe he won't come after us, you know?
Maybe he'll just let us go.

899
01:09:42,070 --> 01:09:44,530
Okay, maybe I can talk to him,
reason with him.

900
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:46,070
We're friends now, right?

901
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:48,200
That's what Harry Lefkowitz thought.

902
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:50,330
What happened to Harry Lefkowitz?

903
01:09:51,910 --> 01:09:54,710
I don't wanna know
what happened to Harry Lefkowitz.

904
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,290
It's your beeper.

905
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:00,670
I know.

906
01:10:02,470 --> 01:10:03,510
It's Jimmy.

907
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:07,180
Jimmy, it's me.

908
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:13,060
Oz, what the hell were you thinking,
taking off with Cynthia like that?

909
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:16,850
I'm sorry, but I can't let you kill her.

910
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:20,020
What do you mean?
That's got nothing to do with you.

911
01:10:21,030 --> 01:10:22,190
I'm in love with her.

912
01:10:24,570 --> 01:10:26,070
Look, I don't...

913
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:31,490
- What did you just say?
- I love her.

914
01:10:35,290 --> 01:10:39,000
Will... Will you listen to yourself?
You love her? You just met her.

915
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:41,670
- He said he's in love with Cynthia.
- No shit.

916
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,590
- So she's the one.
- The one what?

917
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:46,470
- The one he schtupped in Chicago.
- The one he...?

918
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:50,260
My wife.

919
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:54,680
You schtupped my wife, Oz?

920
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:59,270
I wouldn't exactly necessarily phrase it
that way, exactly.

921
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:00,900
Let me get this straight.

922
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:04,610
You went to Chicago and engaged
in sexual congress with my wife?

923
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:08,160
Is that what you're telling me?
Is that it? Is that what you...?

924
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:10,240
- Jimmy, calm down.
- I swear to God!

925
01:11:10,990 --> 01:11:12,330
He's a little upset.

926
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:16,290
- I've managed to upset a mass murderer.
<i>- Tell me where you are!</i>

927
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:18,830
Find out where he is!
Just stay right there!

928
01:11:19,210 --> 01:11:21,340
- Squeeze.
- Oz, you stud, you.

929
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:22,880
Gonna be a dead stud.

930
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:27,220
Tell Jimmy I might have thought
of a way out of this.

931
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:29,890
I know you guys got spare bodies
lying around.

932
01:11:30,090 --> 01:11:31,800
Yeah, one of them is a cop.

933
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:34,930
What's he saying?

934
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:36,430
What's he saying?

935
01:11:37,270 --> 01:11:39,850
Tell him to stay where he is,
I'll be right there.

936
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:42,060
Okay, so that sounds great.

937
01:11:42,270 --> 01:11:45,530
I'm gonna run it by the boys,
and I'll beep you right back. Bye.

938
01:11:48,110 --> 01:11:51,740
Jimmy, when's the last time
you went to the dentist?

939
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:57,460
You really meant it, didn't you?

940
01:11:57,660 --> 01:11:58,960
What you said.

941
01:11:59,790 --> 01:12:04,170
About what? Loving you? Of course,
what did you think this was all about?

942
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:06,670
Sex.

943
01:12:07,510 --> 01:12:10,840
- I mean, great sex, but...
- It was pretty good.

944
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:16,310
Is that all this has meant to you?

945
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:20,350
Don't get me wrong, Oz.
I like you a lot.

946
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:24,070
Well, that's great to hear,
but I've got news for you.

947
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:27,570
I don't go around risking my life
for people that just like me.

948
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:33,410
Well, I do like you.

949
01:12:35,410 --> 01:12:36,410
But...

950
01:12:40,580 --> 01:12:42,420
Then again, who knows? Maybe...

951
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:46,130
Maybe this feeling I've been having
in the pit of my stomach...

952
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:48,710
maybe it's love.

953
01:12:50,470 --> 01:12:51,510
It's your beeper.

954
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:54,100
I know.

955
01:12:59,230 --> 01:13:00,850
- Yeah?
- It's me.

956
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,520
I'll tell you one thing, you got balls.

957
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:06,570
Yeah, who knew?

958
01:13:06,770 --> 01:13:08,570
Jill told me your idea.

959
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:10,780
And...

960
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:16,580
I think it's worth a try.

961
01:13:19,660 --> 01:13:21,960
- Jimmy, thank you.
<i>- But just so you know...</i>

962
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:26,170
I am disappointed, Oz.

963
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:30,630
I am extremely disappointed with you.

964
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:33,930
You're the last person
I would ever want to disappoint,

965
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:37,640
but everything I did was for love.

966
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:41,180
Yeah, whatever.

967
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:44,810
See you at your office.

968
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:46,400
Okay, give me an hour.

969
01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:48,570
And don't forget the corpse.

970
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:00,790
Monsieur Boulez, remember to floss.

971
01:14:05,790 --> 01:14:07,750
Stay on the boat. Take this.

972
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:12,840
If you don't hear from me in two hours,
just go. Disappear, leave the country.

973
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:15,380
Oz.

974
01:14:16,970 --> 01:14:18,140
Be careful.

975
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:24,350
I'm Mr. Careful.

976
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:05,850
Oz, I just wanted
to make sure it was you.

977
01:15:06,270 --> 01:15:07,850
Everybody's inside.

978
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:11,770
By the way, <i>huevos grandes,</i> amigo.

979
01:15:19,450 --> 01:15:21,830
The great and powerful Oz.

980
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:26,830
Why don't we get started?

981
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:57,630
So far, so good.

982
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:03,590
Shit.

983
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:05,140
- Is he up?
- Yeah, got him.

984
01:17:05,350 --> 01:17:08,430
Okay. Now let's see if he stays.

985
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:11,190
All right. Frankie, duct tape.

986
01:17:25,450 --> 01:17:26,700
We did it.

987
01:17:28,870 --> 01:17:30,410
Yeah, I think we're good.

988
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:35,500
- Barbecue?
- Barbecue.

989
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:53,520
Turned out to be a nice night tonight.

990
01:18:00,230 --> 01:18:01,320
I'll be right back.

991
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:08,870
- Who's this remind you of?
- Old Charlie.

992
01:18:19,090 --> 01:18:20,750
All right.

993
01:18:21,210 --> 01:18:22,460
Okay.

994
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:58,380
Doctor? These men need to see you.

995
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,130
Excuse me.

996
01:19:03,050 --> 01:19:04,630
Right this way, gentlemen.

997
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:10,930
Dr. Oseransky,
I'm Sergeant Buchanan.

998
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:12,510
This is Officer Morrissey.

999
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:16,270
Yes, well, what can I do for you?

1000
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:22,480
Are you the owner
of a brown Toyota Corolla

1001
01:19:22,690 --> 01:19:26,030
license number ZSJ-959?

1002
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:28,280
Yes, is there a problem?

1003
01:19:28,490 --> 01:19:30,620
Do you know where your vehicle is, sir?

1004
01:19:30,820 --> 01:19:33,573
I lent it to my
neighbor. He went fishing.

1005
01:19:33,594 --> 01:19:35,770
This neighbor, he got a name?

1006
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:38,080
Jimmy Jones.

1007
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:44,340
Would you mind taking us
to his place of residence?

1008
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:48,260
Your car was found by the grain silo
at the old port.

1009
01:19:48,470 --> 01:19:51,050
Two bodies were inside of it.
There'd been a fire.

1010
01:19:52,350 --> 01:19:54,310
- Oh, my god.
- The extent of the burns

1011
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:56,850
made any normal
identification impossible.

1012
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:58,810
Dental impressions were taken.

1013
01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:02,310
From the records, we were able
to establish that the bodies

1014
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:07,490
were those of one Janni Pytor Gogolak
and James Stefan Tudeski.

1015
01:20:07,690 --> 01:20:10,990
Both of them were big shots
in a Chicago crime syndicate.

1016
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:16,080
- And you think this James...
- Tudeski.

1017
01:20:16,290 --> 01:20:17,870
Is the Jimmy I know?

1018
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:20,790
Well, that's what we intend to find out.

1019
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:34,510
Isn't that Hanson's car?

1020
01:20:35,970 --> 01:20:38,890
Go have a look.

1021
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,150
Who's...? Who's Hanson?

1022
01:20:42,350 --> 01:20:43,810
One of our men.

1023
01:20:44,020 --> 01:20:46,110
He was on an undercover assignment.

1024
01:20:46,730 --> 01:20:50,450
There was some concern earlier because
he failed to check in this morning.

1025
01:21:06,670 --> 01:21:08,550
<i>Your mother, she knows about this?</i>

1026
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:11,260
<i>My mother wants this to
happen as much as I do.</i>

1027
01:21:11,470 --> 01:21:14,340
<i>And I really,
really want this to happen.</i>

1028
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:23,940
It's Hanson's car all right,
but no sign of Hanson.

1029
01:21:24,150 --> 01:21:26,320
- But I found a tape.
- Tsk, tsk.

1030
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:41,750
Dr. Oseransky, could you tell us
where your wife might be?

1031
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:45,040
My wife? She's in Niagara Falls
with her mother. Why?

1032
01:21:47,090 --> 01:21:49,760
Dr. Oseransky,
I don't know how to tell you this,

1033
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:53,510
but it seems that your wife
tried to hire a hit man to kill you.

1034
01:21:54,550 --> 01:21:56,010
A hit man?

1035
01:21:57,180 --> 01:21:58,430
Oh, my god.

1036
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:07,730
There's no smoking in here.

1037
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:18,200
So where is he, Mrs. Oseransky?

1038
01:22:18,410 --> 01:22:21,450
- Questions for you, better have answers.
- Hi, Mom.

1039
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:27,290
You can ask me questions,
but until I speak to my attorney...

1040
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:31,300
You spoke to your attorney. He doesn't
want to have anything to do with you.

1041
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:35,430
Special Agent Hanson, Mrs. Oseransky.
What did you do to him?

1042
01:22:35,630 --> 01:22:36,970
Wasn't me.

1043
01:22:37,180 --> 01:22:39,930
We have your voice on tape,
his written reports.

1044
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:43,640
We know you tried to hire him
to kill your husband. So, what happened?

1045
01:22:44,270 --> 01:22:45,690
He tried to back out?

1046
01:22:46,230 --> 01:22:48,940
He tried to back out and you killed him.

1047
01:22:49,150 --> 01:22:51,980
None of this would've happened
if that girl had done her job.

1048
01:22:52,570 --> 01:22:55,570
- What girl?
- Jill. My husband's receptionist.

1049
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:59,280
Yeah?
Was she a contract killer too?

1050
01:22:59,490 --> 01:23:00,990
Yes. I hired her.

1051
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:02,540
She's the killer.

1052
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:12,300
This would be sad
if it wasn't so pathetic.

1053
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:14,130
Do you wanna talk to her?

1054
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:16,260
No.

1055
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:18,010
No, I don't think so.

1056
01:23:18,090 --> 01:23:19,850
I don't blame you.

1057
01:23:20,890 --> 01:23:22,970
You guys know a good divorce lawyer?

1058
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:26,390
She did it. She's a killer.
You've got to believe me.

1059
01:23:34,610 --> 01:23:37,195
I got all the I's dotted,
all the T's crossed.

1060
01:23:37,216 --> 01:23:39,470
Jimmy's got his
own way of spelling.

1061
01:23:39,530 --> 01:23:42,450
I'll take care of Jimmy.
You're never gonna see him again.

1062
01:23:42,660 --> 01:23:46,330
While you and Jill are at the bank,
Jimmy and I will be at the museum.

1063
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:50,000
- Jimmy at a fine-art museum?
- There's people at a fine-art museum.

1064
01:23:50,210 --> 01:23:51,540
He's not gonna try anything.

1065
01:23:53,210 --> 01:23:54,550
All right, if you say so.

1066
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:08,310
Where's Cynthia?

1067
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:12,150
You and I are leaving.

1068
01:24:17,030 --> 01:24:20,860
I'll beep Cynthia. She'll get in touch
with you and tell you where to go.

1069
01:24:21,070 --> 01:24:23,370
Listen to him, Mr. Cloak and Dagger.

1070
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:26,620
- I'm being careful. I'm a dentist.
- Yeah.

1071
01:24:32,210 --> 01:24:34,090
You boys play nice now.

1072
01:24:39,130 --> 01:24:40,630
Take us to the art museum.

1073
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:46,890
You really think if Cynthia doesn't come
through, you'll be safer at the museum?

1074
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:02,320
Hello?

1075
01:25:04,450 --> 01:25:06,580
Yeah. Yeah.

1076
01:25:06,790 --> 01:25:10,500
Hope there was nothing special you
wanted to see at the museum today.

1077
01:25:10,580 --> 01:25:12,960
- Why?
- We're not going to the art museum.

1078
01:25:13,170 --> 01:25:14,540
We're going to the marina.

1079
01:25:15,290 --> 01:25:17,210
- The marina?
- Yeah.

1080
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:21,130
I rented a boat for the day.
Isn't that right, Frankie?

1081
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:28,720
See?

1082
01:25:29,310 --> 01:25:30,640
I'm careful too.

1083
01:26:13,270 --> 01:26:14,190
You're Jill?

1084
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:17,730
Nice to meet you.

1085
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:22,570
- Where's your gun?
- What makes you think I have a gun?

1086
01:26:35,540 --> 01:26:36,580
Throw it in.

1087
01:26:44,050 --> 01:26:45,550
Do you have the certificates?

1088
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:48,720
Let's go banking.

1089
01:26:54,890 --> 01:26:56,810
Everything seems to be in order.

1090
01:26:57,020 --> 01:27:01,320
- Where would you like the money sent?
- To a bank in the Caymans. Account...

1091
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:04,570
- Can we just have a minute, please?
- Certainly.

1092
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:07,070
- Thanks.
- I'll be right over there.

1093
01:27:15,250 --> 01:27:17,170
We could just walk away, you know.

1094
01:27:17,710 --> 01:27:20,590
You and me. With the whole 10 million.

1095
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:28,130
So, what do you think?

1096
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:36,350
I think...

1097
01:27:37,270 --> 01:27:39,850
I know that if we did,
Jimmy would kill Oz.

1098
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:41,480
So what?

1099
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:50,070
You're a lucky guy, Oz.

1100
01:27:50,870 --> 01:27:52,080
Why would you say that?

1101
01:27:52,780 --> 01:27:56,250
You're about to find out
if the woman you love really loves you.

1102
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:58,250
Want a beer?

1103
01:27:59,710 --> 01:28:05,260
If it was me, if I was in her position,
I'd just take the money and run.

1104
01:28:08,550 --> 01:28:09,800
What are you betting on?

1105
01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:12,550
I'm betting on love.

1106
01:28:13,970 --> 01:28:16,180
Love for you means money for me.

1107
01:28:16,980 --> 01:28:20,480
And like I said before,
I'd really hate to have to kill you.

1108
01:28:34,580 --> 01:28:38,410
- So, when are you gonna do it?
- Let's make sure we got the money first.

1109
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:43,670
But you are intending to kill him?

1110
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:49,170
Jimmy, listen, he was there.

1111
01:28:49,590 --> 01:28:52,140
He was there
when you killed Janni and a cop.

1112
01:28:52,340 --> 01:28:54,350
Now, I know you like this guy.

1113
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:57,850
Yeah, I do.

1114
01:28:58,060 --> 01:28:59,100
But he's got to go.

1115
01:28:59,310 --> 01:29:02,650
- And if you ain't prepared to do it, then...
- Hey, hey, Frankie.

1116
01:29:04,190 --> 01:29:06,520
Let's not forget who
you're talking to, okay?

1117
01:29:08,690 --> 01:29:10,650
Jimmy Tudeski may be dead,

1118
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:13,620
but he ain't exactly
dead. You understand?

1119
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:16,620
Glad to hear it.

1120
01:29:17,950 --> 01:29:19,450
Just drive the boat.

1121
01:29:24,130 --> 01:29:28,510
Think about it, Cynthia. We're
talking about $5 million apiece here.

1122
01:29:28,710 --> 01:29:30,510
Is Oz worth that much to you?

1123
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:35,800
The thing is, is....

1124
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:39,520
- I think I love him.
- You think?

1125
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:43,600
You think? Sweetheart, for $5 million,
you better be damn certain.

1126
01:29:47,230 --> 01:29:48,570
I am.

1127
01:29:49,530 --> 01:29:53,070
I'm sorry, but I... I love him.

1128
01:29:54,570 --> 01:29:56,200
- You do?
- Yeah.

1129
01:29:56,620 --> 01:29:59,450
That's the right answer.
Guy, you can come back now.

1130
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:07,380
Yeah?

1131
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,130
Yeah.

1132
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:13,300
Okay.

1133
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,140
Okay.

1134
01:30:19,850 --> 01:30:20,890
We got the money.

1135
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:27,860
Bye-bye, Oz.

1136
01:30:30,730 --> 01:30:31,820
But...

1137
01:30:40,660 --> 01:30:42,040
Sorry, Frankie.

1138
01:30:43,460 --> 01:30:44,540
I always liked you.

1139
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,790
Wh... Why... Why did you kill him?

1140
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:51,250
Well, I had to kill one of you.

1141
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:56,720
Well, then you definitely made
the right decision.

1142
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:02,810
But why did you have to kill him?

1143
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:10,610
Well, if I didn't kill you,
Frankie would have.

1144
01:31:11,610 --> 01:31:12,820
And...

1145
01:31:14,150 --> 01:31:16,450
he would have thought
that I'd gone soft,

1146
01:31:16,990 --> 01:31:19,780
eventually come after me and the money.

1147
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,160
So...

1148
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:28,040
what about me?

1149
01:31:29,630 --> 01:31:32,800
I want the bulk of the money
to be put into this account.

1150
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,840
I also want $1 million
to be placed in this account

1151
01:31:36,050 --> 01:31:39,590
under the name of Dr. Nicholas
and Mrs. Cynthia Oseransky.

1152
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:42,100
- One million.
- What?

1153
01:31:42,310 --> 01:31:44,350
An early wedding present from Jimmy.

1154
01:31:47,140 --> 01:31:48,520
Not that Jimmy.

1155
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:51,860
Can we have another minute?

1156
01:31:52,570 --> 01:31:54,780
- Certainly. I'll just...
- Thanks.

1157
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:02,910
- Is this for real?
- Yes, in order to get the money,

1158
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:07,370
show up together and show them a copy
of a validated marriage certificate.

1159
01:32:08,210 --> 01:32:09,750
Jimmy's giving me a divorce?

1160
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:13,710
Don't you read the papers, lady?
Jimmy Tudeski's dead.

1161
01:32:20,550 --> 01:32:24,140
- I don't know what to say.
- When the time comes, just say "I do."

1162
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:31,690
Maybe I am going soft. In the old days,
I would have definitely killed you.

1163
01:32:31,810 --> 01:32:34,150
Don't be so hard on yourself.

1164
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:37,860
Or...

1165
01:32:38,070 --> 01:32:39,450
I don't know.

1166
01:32:40,150 --> 01:32:42,200
Maybe I have changed since my death.

1167
01:32:44,410 --> 01:32:46,240
I don't think that's what it is.

1168
01:32:46,450 --> 01:32:47,910
What do you mean?

1169
01:32:50,210 --> 01:32:52,000
You love her, don't you?

1170
01:32:52,210 --> 01:32:53,460
Cynthia?

1171
01:33:09,730 --> 01:33:13,560
Hi, Oz. Cynthia's waiting for you.
She said you'd know where.

1172
01:33:18,030 --> 01:33:20,320
Say hi to my widow for me, will you?

1173
01:33:22,740 --> 01:33:24,240
Take care of yourself.

1174
01:33:44,890 --> 01:33:46,260
Marry me.

1175
01:33:52,270 --> 01:33:53,650
Jimmy told you.

1176
01:33:55,190 --> 01:33:56,020
What?

1177
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:00,740
He didn't, did he?

1178
01:34:04,660 --> 01:34:07,950
You just want to marry me?

1179
01:34:08,370 --> 01:34:09,410
No.

1180
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:13,000
No, I don't just want to marry you.

1181
01:34:14,670 --> 01:34:19,800
I want to marry you more
than anyone's wanted to marry anyone.

1182
01:34:24,260 --> 01:34:26,550
Then would I be out of line
if I told you...

1183
01:34:28,430 --> 01:34:29,470
that I loved you?

1184
01:34:42,030 --> 01:34:43,190
And said, yes?

1185
01:34:46,530 --> 01:34:48,070
I would love to marry you.

1186
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:52,790
So you wouldn't mind spending the
rest of your life with a poor dentist?

1187
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:56,830
Something tells me we'll get by.

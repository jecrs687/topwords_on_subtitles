1
00:00:01,968 --> 00:00:03,736
(Siren)

2
00:00:17,316 --> 00:00:18,951
- We set up
fair-trade agreements

3
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:21,387
with women's organizations
in poverty-stricken areas

4
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,189
of Turkey, Morocco
and Indonesia,

5
00:00:23,222 --> 00:00:24,690
with future
development scheduled

6
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:26,959
for India and central
and southern Africa.

7
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:29,261
- So tell us,
how does this work exactly?

8
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:32,832
- Being properly compensated
for their labour and their goods

9
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:35,167
enables them, in turn,
to support their families,

10
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,470
educate their children,
create local industry

11
00:00:37,503 --> 00:00:39,138
and build economic growth.

12
00:00:39,171 --> 00:00:40,773
- And your partners?

13
00:00:40,806 --> 00:00:44,043
I mean, Fyne Designs is not
just Sophie Fyne. Is it?

14
00:00:44,076 --> 00:00:47,913
- No, we are 3 equal partners
with 3 very specific talents.

15
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:49,482
- Ian Jameson,
for example,

16
00:00:49,515 --> 00:00:51,917
he's had a lot of
international recognition

17
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:54,420
for his innovative
development strategies.

18
00:00:54,453 --> 00:00:56,122
A bit of a whiz kid,
would you say?

19
00:00:56,155 --> 00:00:57,456
- No, he definitely is.

20
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,026
And Adam Fyne brilliantly
manages our finances,

21
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,495
which enables both Ian and I
to do what we do best.

22
00:01:02,528 --> 00:01:05,264
- And what is it
that you do best, Sophie?

23
00:01:05,297 --> 00:01:07,800
- Using regional and
sustainable materials,

24
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,969
I try to design clothing
and accessories

25
00:01:10,002 --> 00:01:12,938
that reflect the strength
and resilience of women...

26
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:14,974
(Goat bleating
and bell tinkling)

27
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:17,777
...honouring their cultural
skills and craftsmanship

28
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,845
and celebrating their beauty.

29
00:01:21,013 --> 00:01:22,715
-
Wonderful.

30
00:01:23,382 --> 00:01:26,252
Now, with only a few
select retailers

31
00:01:26,285 --> 00:01:28,387
carrying the
Fyne Designs label,

32
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:31,323
to now launching
your very own store

33
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:34,093
in Manhattan's coveted
Lower East Side,

34
00:01:34,126 --> 00:01:35,728
how do you feel?

35
00:01:36,395 --> 00:01:38,197
- Positive.

36
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,099
Exhilarated. Um...

37
00:01:40,132 --> 00:01:41,233
(Chuckling)

38
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,468
Mostly terrified.

39
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:45,738
(Bucket clattering)

40
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:50,109
(Goat bleating)

41
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,894
(Gasps)

42
00:02:16,535 --> 00:02:18,437
- But let's talk
a little bit about

43
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,473
your highly-anticipated
ad campaign.

44
00:02:20,506 --> 00:02:23,342
It's expected to be
very cutting edge,

45
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,977
to really make a statement.

46
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:25,811
Tell us.

47
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:27,012
- It's called Empower,

48
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:29,915
stressing how women should not
be victimized by fashion.

49
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:32,418
That means those wearing it,
buying it or making it.

50
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:35,554
- Great. Thank you so much for
taking time out to speak to us

51
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:37,423
and, uh, we wish you
all the best.

52
00:02:37,456 --> 00:02:39,291
With the opening
just 7 days away,

53
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,426
we'll be
following closely.

54
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:41,427
- Thank you.

55
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,928

Oh, for god sake!

It looks amazing.

00:03:34,513 --> 00:03:36,182
(Sighing)

78
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:39,351
- I don't know about you, but
I'm kind of turned on right now.

79
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,487
- Yeah, that would be
why I hired you

80
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,422
and why I would
never sleep with you.

81
00:03:43,455 --> 00:03:44,423
(Chuckles)

82
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:45,624
- Are sure about this?

83
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:48,127
I mean, an ad campaign
about a clothing line

84
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,295
without any clothes.

85
00:03:49,328 --> 00:03:52,097
I mean, I've done some pretty
out-there stuff, believe me.

86
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:54,200
- We talking personally
or professionally?

87
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:56,402
- Is there a difference?

88
00:03:56,435 --> 00:03:58,604
- No, I've got something
important to say

89
00:03:58,637 --> 00:04:00,973
and I've got a rare
opportunity to do it.

90
00:04:01,006 --> 00:04:03,909
So with your help, we can get
somebody to hear what it is

91
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:06,512
and maybe even do
something about it.

92
00:04:06,545 --> 00:04:08,447
- So you think there's
actually more to life

93
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,950
than satisfying
your own needs and desires?

94
00:04:10,983 --> 00:04:11,951
Nah.

95
00:04:11,984 --> 00:04:12,585
(Giggling)

96
00:04:12,618 --> 00:04:14,186
- Get out of here!

97
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,055
(Ringing)

98
00:04:17,456 --> 00:04:18,390
Hey, honey!
-
Hey, Mom.

99
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,525
- Home from school?

100
00:04:19,558 --> 00:04:21,927
-
Not yet. I was gonna
stop by the studio

101
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:23,996
and maybe help out
with the photo shoot.

102
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:25,097
- Spencer.

103
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,166
-
I wanna show you
I can do it. I'm ready.

104
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,668
- How many times do we have
to have this conversation?

105
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:30,736
It's not gonna happen.

106
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:32,671
-
I don't get it.
You work in fashion

107
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:34,673
and with models who are
younger than me.

108
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:36,008
What's the difference?

109
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,543
- If you had to pay
for oxygen,

110
00:04:37,576 --> 00:04:39,545
you wouldn't waste
so much of it on this.

111
00:04:39,578 --> 00:04:41,180
-It's not fair.
Daddy would let me.

112
00:04:41,213 --> 00:04:43,282
- We'll talk about this
when I'll get home.

113
00:04:43,315 --> 00:04:44,550
-Fine.

114
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,418

118
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:26,819
- Hi.

119
00:06:26,852 --> 00:06:28,587

00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,158

121
00:06:37,796 --> 00:06:39,231
I missed you.

122
00:06:39,264 --> 00:06:40,499
- I missed you too.

(Giggling)

124
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:46,705
Won't need this either.

125
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:57,282
- Ah!

126
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,051
- Ooh! What's wrong?

127
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:01,653
Are you OK?

128
00:07:02,454 --> 00:07:03,722

clumsy husband tripped

146

and was impaled on
a bead-carving tool

147
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,248
in one of the workshops.

148
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,650
- Did you see a doctor?

149
00:08:04,683 --> 00:08:07,419
- I did, but there was a woman
there who fixed me up good.

150
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:09,588
Looks vicious,

It's nothing, come on!

153
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:14,827
- Yeah, it doesn't
look like nothing.

154
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:18,630
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

155
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,699
Wow! Remind me to
go away more often

156
00:08:20,732 --> 00:08:23,869
if that is the welcome I get
from my beautiful daughter

157
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:24,937
when I get home.

158
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,906
- She's saving money on oxygen.
- I bet. Come on.

159
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,907
- I missed you.

160
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:30,843
- Yes, I missed you too.

161
00:08:30,876 --> 00:08:32,644
And you're late.

162
00:08:33,812 --> 00:08:35,180
Come eat.

163
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:36,248
- Models don't eat.

164
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:37,516
- Spencer, sweetheart,

165
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:39,251
you will model
over my dead body.

166
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:40,752
You're too young.

167
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:43,522
Besides, 6 months ago, you were
ripping up fashion magazines

168
00:08:43,555 --> 00:08:45,491
protesting the
exploitation of women.

169
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:47,559
Now all of a sudden
you want to be a model.

170
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:49,595
- It's a woman's privilege
to change her mind.

171
00:08:49,628 --> 00:08:52,297
- Yes. Yes, it is.

172
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,766
Except you are not
a woman yet.

173
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,468
- Daddy!

174
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:57,970
- Legally, your mom's
got a point.

175
00:08:58,003 --> 00:09:00,272
My point is if you
declare your womanhood,

176
00:09:00,305 --> 00:09:02,941
it weakens your argument to
be calling to Daddy for help.

177
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,476
Huh?

178
00:09:08,313 --> 00:09:09,815
- Hey! Not near
the Chanel, Spencer!

179
00:09:09,848 --> 00:09:11,683
- Sometimes I think
you care more

180
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,919
about that stupid
sketch book than me.

181
00:09:13,952 --> 00:09:14,920
(Scoffing)

182
00:09:14,953 --> 00:09:16,288
- Ouch!

183
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:17,756
(Clearing throat)

184
00:09:17,789 --> 00:09:19,424
What's going on
with you two?

185
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,792
- It's been
3 weeks of that.

186
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,361
- Oh yeah?
What prompted it?

187
00:09:22,394 --> 00:09:23,896
- Her 16th birthday.

188
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:26,265
- Huh!

189
00:09:26,298 --> 00:09:27,566
- So, how was the trip?

190
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:28,867
- Oh! Well, after
jumping through

191
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,270
way too many frustrating
hoops and time zones,

192
00:09:31,303 --> 00:09:33,672
everything is finally
arranged and on schedule.

193
00:09:33,705 --> 00:09:36,575
- Good. Did you bring samples of
the beaded garments with you?

194
00:09:36,608 --> 00:09:37,576
- Ian's got them.

195
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:38,644
- I'll get them later.

196
00:09:38,677 --> 00:09:40,312
- Well, he's not back yet.

197
00:09:40,345 --> 00:09:41,480
- What? Is there a problem?

198
00:09:41,513 --> 00:09:43,448
You just said
everything was on track.

199
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:45,350
- Everything is
on track, Sophie.

200
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:46,585
You know Ian.
He's thorough.

201
00:09:46,618 --> 00:09:49,555
He decided to head back to Fez
to triple-check everything.

202
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:51,890
- Oh! Reminds me.
Did you see this about Ian?

203
00:09:53,358 --> 00:09:56,261
- Yes. I did.

204
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:57,262
Nice.

205
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,797
- It's good, right?

206
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,033
- Sure getting a lot
of press, isn't he?

207
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:02,968
- For our company.

208
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:04,336
- I know. I just...

209
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:06,305
I know.

210
00:10:06,338 --> 00:10:10,309
He'll be back in a few days.
Just in time for the opening.

211
00:10:10,342 --> 00:10:11,910
- I'm glad you're home.

212
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,645
- Glad to be home.

213
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:17,516
(Both sighing)

214
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:19,484
- Spencer! You're gonna
be late for school!

215
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:21,420
- Huh!

216
00:10:21,453 --> 00:10:22,621
(Chuckles)

217
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,825
Oh, hey!

218
00:10:26,858 --> 00:10:29,461
You know, I heard this
rumour that models don't eat,

219
00:10:29,494 --> 00:10:30,596
but students do.

220
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:32,631
- Have a
good day, sweetie.

221
00:10:32,664 --> 00:10:33,899
(Sophie chuckles)

222
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:34,967
- Oh!

223
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,636
Well, you know, we made it
through the terrible twos.

224
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:38,904
This is gonna
be a breeze.

225
00:10:38,937 --> 00:10:39,905
- Yeah.

226
00:10:39,938 --> 00:10:41,573
- Thank you.

227
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,508
(Clears throat)

228
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:46,411
(Honking)

229
00:10:47,412 --> 00:10:49,381
(Siren in distance)

230
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,565
(Talking, indistinct)

231
00:11:06,598 --> 00:11:08,600
- Sophie, we've got
a problem.

232
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:10,869
- Uh, "challenge," Alexa,
not "problem".

233
00:11:10,902 --> 00:11:14,006
- The colour of the fabric dyed
at the workshop in Fez

234
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:16,742
doesn't match our
finished purse style SF1227.

235
00:11:16,775 --> 00:11:18,810
But they said it
turned out nice anyway.

236
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,712
So the problem is-- Sorry.

237
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:23,649
The challenge is if you need
to see the colour for approval,

238
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,517
it'll delay getting to
the embroiderers,

239
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,818
the beaders and the sewers,

240
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,820
postponing the
scheduled completion

241
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,722
and shipping date
for the bags.

242
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:33,425
- Right. I'll take care of it.
Thank you.

243
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:34,426
- (Man 1): That one?

244
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:36,628
- (Man 2): Yes. Here.

245
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,398
(Talking, indistinct)

246
00:11:45,937 --> 00:11:47,706
- Come on!

247
00:11:52,644 --> 00:11:54,379
- (Man 2): Jeff!
Jeff, come here.

248
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:55,914
(Cell phone ringing)

249
00:11:55,947 --> 00:11:58,850
- Hope all this publicity isn't
going to your handsome head.

250
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,686
-
Excuse me?
-
Oh, hey, Adam.

251
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,954
I thought you were
Ian calling me back.

252
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:05,991
- Networks are a little spotty
in the more remote villages.

253
00:12:06,024 --> 00:12:07,159
So what's up?

254
00:12:07,192 --> 00:12:09,161
-You said he was going
back to Fez, right?

255
00:12:09,194 --> 00:12:10,829
- Yeah, that's right.

256
00:12:10,862 --> 00:12:13,098
- We've got a dye-lot question
that needs an answer,

257
00:12:13,131 --> 00:12:14,700
so I thought maybe--

258
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,601
- Perhaps he can take
his handsome head

259
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:18,136
and check in with
Mrs. Bashiri, right?

260
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,472
- Exactly.

261
00:12:20,505 --> 00:12:22,074
- If I can reach him,
I will ask.

262
00:12:22,107 --> 00:12:23,909
- Thank you. Bye.

263
00:12:23,942 --> 00:12:24,843
- See ya.

264
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:50,969
(Honking)

265
00:12:53,872 --> 00:12:55,841
- And how's life
in the art world?

266
00:12:55,874 --> 00:12:57,909
- It's insane. The worse
the economy gets,

267
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,679
the more people need
to sell their collections.

268
00:13:00,712 --> 00:13:03,648
It's actually brought some
amazing pieces to the market.

269
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,051
I'm overseeing this huge
auction this week...

270
00:13:06,084 --> 00:13:07,753
You OK?

271
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,621
- Oh, sorry, Drea.
It's just Spencer.

272
00:13:09,654 --> 00:13:11,857
Wish there was way
to make her understand

273
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,760
that her mother does know
what's good for her.

274
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:17,929
- Well, if you figure it out
you'll revolutionize parenting.

275
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:21,767
Listen, you are a fantastic
mother who loves her daughter.

276
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,468
You guys are gonna
figure this out.

277
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:26,538
By the time she's
40 at the latest.

278
00:13:26,571 --> 00:13:27,773
- Oh great!
Thank you so much.

279
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:31,042
Oh, and the deadline for the
opening isn't exactly helping.

280
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:31,743
It's 5 days away.

281
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,545
I don't know
if our shipment

282
00:13:33,578 --> 00:13:34,946
is going to get
here in time.

283
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,549
Everything we have
is riding on this.

284
00:13:37,582 --> 00:13:38,550
Oh! It's my turn.

285
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:39,584
- Oh. Thanks.

286
00:13:41,586 --> 00:13:43,088
- Thank you.

287
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:46,191
(Sighing)

288
00:13:46,224 --> 00:13:47,793
It's just a lot, you know.

289
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:48,960
- Yeah.

290
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,228
-
Mesdames.

291
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:51,830
- Claudio.

292
00:13:51,863 --> 00:13:53,565
- Hi.

293
00:13:53,598 --> 00:13:55,534
- Your whole
saving-the world-

294
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:57,569
one-designer-outfit-
at-a-time thing

295
00:13:57,602 --> 00:13:59,504
is literally starting
to wear thin.

296
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:00,806
There's a certain way

297
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,542
that the fashion business
has always been done

298
00:14:03,575 --> 00:14:05,210
and will continue
to be done.

299
00:14:05,243 --> 00:14:08,580
You're getting to be too good
at making us all look very bad.

300
00:14:08,613 --> 00:14:10,081
- You don't need
Sophie for that.

301
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,951
- You can change the way
you run your company.

302
00:14:12,984 --> 00:14:13,852
- Oh?

303
00:14:13,885 --> 00:14:16,188
- Enable everybody
involved to benefit,

304
00:14:16,221 --> 00:14:17,756
rather then just
a select few.

305
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:20,725
Or you can stick to your
old ways and take and take

306
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:23,295
and never
give anything back.

307
00:14:23,328 --> 00:14:25,230
This way, I can
sleep at night.

308
00:14:25,263 --> 00:14:26,731
There's a lot
of amazing women

309
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:28,600
all over the world
working with us,

310
00:14:28,633 --> 00:14:29,734
who can do
the same thing.

311
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:33,738
- Rest assured, Sophie, dear.
I sleep like a baby.

312
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:36,741
Besides, you should never
mess with a classic.

313
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:39,744
Speaking of which, any chance
you're ready to part

314
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:41,913
with that beloved
Chanel book of yours?

315
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:42,747
- No, Claudio.

316
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,149
- A word to the wise:

317
00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:46,117
Fashion has its price

318
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:48,286
and it's very, very high.

319
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,387
- Um, I'm sorry, Ms. Fyne.

320
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:53,225
But there seems to be a problem
with your credit card.

321
00:14:53,258 --> 00:14:54,626
- Oh.

322
00:14:54,659 --> 00:14:56,895
- Like I said, very high.

323
00:14:56,928 --> 00:15:00,031
- That's impossible. I'm sorry,
would you mind running it again?

324
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,100
- Um, I already did.

325
00:15:02,133 --> 00:15:04,035
- Next time.

326
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,203
(Sighing)

327
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,204
(Scoffs)

328
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,906
- He just keeps
getting older

329
00:15:07,939 --> 00:15:10,575
while his playmates
stay the same age.

330
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,777
- Maybe he's taking up
babysitting.

331
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:15,313
Probably needs cash after
the rotten year he's had.

332
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:17,215
- See? Maybe karma
does exist.

333
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:20,118
(Laughing)

334
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:21,820
- Oh!

335
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:23,822
(Sophie laughing)

336
00:15:23,855 --> 00:15:26,157
- Well, give Spencer
a hug for me, huh?

337
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:27,659
- I'll try.

338
00:15:29,694 --> 00:15:31,696
- (Both): Bye.

339
00:16:09,834 --> 00:16:13,638
- Hey, Mike, it's lunch time.
Let's go grab a bite.

340
00:16:14,906 --> 00:16:17,008
(Creaking)

341
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,009
Look out!

342
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,422
- Listen, if we don't
have it this week,

343
00:16:30,455 --> 00:16:32,257
my guys are gonna
be delayed.

344
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,392
There's no way
we can finish on time.

345
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,795
- Listen, we'll finish
this later. OK, Jerry?

346
00:16:36,828 --> 00:16:38,029
Thank you.
I promise.

347
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:38,697
Hey! How was lunch?

348
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,298
- It was OK,
except why would

349
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,866
my credit card
be declined?

350
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,035
- What? Um, I don't know.
It's strange.

351
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:45,070
I'll give them a call.

352
00:16:45,103 --> 00:16:47,706
- And did you get a hold
of Ian about the dye lot?

353
00:16:47,739 --> 00:16:49,441
- I did, so the purses
can be sized and cut

354
00:16:49,474 --> 00:16:50,976
before heading out to Meknes

355
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:52,978
for embroidery, beading
and finishing.

356
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:53,812
Yes, I did.

357
00:16:53,845 --> 00:16:55,814
- Thank you.
And when's he coming back?

358
00:16:55,847 --> 00:16:58,817
- Actually, he's in Tunisia,
checking out some new suppliers.

359
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,418
- The opening's in 5 days!

360
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:02,220
We need everybody here,
not Tunisia.

361
00:17:02,253 --> 00:17:04,022
That's not best use
of his time.

362
00:17:04,055 --> 00:17:05,357
- I'll call him.

363
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,358
- Thank you.

364
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:08,059
- You're welcome.

365
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:09,361
Hey! Is that my key?

366
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:10,395
- Yes, your new copy.

367
00:17:10,428 --> 00:17:11,396
- Yes, thank you.

368
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:12,764
(Cell phone ringing)

369
00:17:12,797 --> 00:17:13,398
Oh!

370
00:17:13,431 --> 00:17:14,399
(Clears throat)

371
00:17:14,432 --> 00:17:16,034
Hello?

372
00:17:16,067 --> 00:17:17,936
OK. Thanks.

373
00:17:17,969 --> 00:17:19,371
Customs.

374
00:17:19,404 --> 00:17:21,439
- Our shipment?
That would be really good.

375
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,174
(Giggling)

376
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,910
- See ya. Bye.
- Bye.

377
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:27,178
Hello.

378
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,313
- Sophie,
we really gotta go.

379
00:17:28,346 --> 00:17:30,048
Katif's waiting
in the studio.

380
00:17:30,081 --> 00:17:31,216
- Oh! Yeah. Thanks.

381
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:35,754
(Car honking)

382
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:40,358
- The dried fibres of the lokta
bark woven into the fabric

383
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,926
gives it more body
and texture.

384
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,428
- These are
exquisite, Katif.

385
00:17:43,461 --> 00:17:45,463
So the lokta plant
is sustainable?

386
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:48,099
- Oh, we harvest just
the bark, which regenerates.

387
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:49,267
(Clears throat)

388
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,269
- I can already think
of a dozen designs

389
00:17:51,302 --> 00:17:53,138
for the next
collection with this.

390
00:17:53,171 --> 00:17:54,139
Let's add, um...

391
00:17:54,172 --> 00:17:57,242
Let's add a 20-yard cut
of this one to my order.

392
00:17:57,275 --> 00:17:58,443
You know what?
- Mm-hmm?

393
00:17:58,476 --> 00:18:01,346
- One each of this
and the grey.

394
00:18:01,379 --> 00:18:03,081
- Always a pleasure.

395
00:18:04,115 --> 00:18:06,017
Um, uh, Sophie.

396
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,219
I do have to talk
to you about something

397
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,454
that isn't sustainable.

398
00:18:09,487 --> 00:18:11,056
- Of course.

399
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:12,223
- Our payment terms.

400
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,491
We need to
switch to COD.

401
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:14,893
- Don't be ridiculous.

402
00:18:14,926 --> 00:18:16,861
As long as we've
known each other,

403
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:18,897
you know we have
impeccable credit.

404
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,132
- Word on the street
right now is otherwise.

405
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,834
Big city, small street.

406
00:18:22,867 --> 00:18:25,336
- Ka-- Katif, there's gotta
be some kind of mistake.

407
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,404
- I'm sorry, Sophie.

408
00:18:27,405 --> 00:18:29,240
It's business.

409
00:18:31,242 --> 00:18:33,244
(Boys laughing and talking)

410
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,846
- (Boy): Yo, yo!

411
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,548
- You're totally worth it.

412
00:18:36,581 --> 00:18:37,382
No!

413
00:18:37,415 --> 00:18:39,017
(Girl talking, indistinct)

414
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,085
- (Boy): Yo! Hold up!

415
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:41,019
(Many voices talking)

416
00:18:41,052 --> 00:18:43,254
- (Justin):
...especially in the summer.

417
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,256
- Exactly.
- It's like a nice...

418
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,257
- Hey, Justin!

419
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,358
- Hi. Yeah, nice...

420
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:48,793
(Talking, indistinct)

421
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,164
- (Boy):
Hey, pass it here!

422
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,433
- (Girl):
Good! You know it!

423
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,873
(♪ Muted music
in earphones ♪)

424
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,829
- Adam, I just met with Katif.

425
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,398
He wants payment on delivery.
Do we have a problem?

426
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:29,100
- Yeah, we do.

427
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:31,803
Mr. Fyne! Please.

428
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,038
- I gotta go.

429
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,378
(Man on CB, indistinct)

430
00:19:40,411 --> 00:19:41,579
- Have a look.

431
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,050
- Oh!

432
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:47,318
(Fly buzzing)

433
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,820
(Exhaling)

434
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:11,075
- I'm FBI Agent Fincher.
Thank you both for coming down.

435
00:20:13,344 --> 00:20:15,480
With high temperatures
this time of year,

436
00:20:15,513 --> 00:20:17,615
"decomp" was severely
accelerated,

437
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:20,919
so making time of death almost
impossible to determine.

438
00:20:20,952 --> 00:20:24,522
We do know the "vic" is female
and was most likely strangled.

439
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,424
- I'm--I'm sorry.
I'm not sure I understand.

440
00:20:26,457 --> 00:20:27,392
Aside from the fact

441
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:29,494
that an article of
our clothing was found,

442
00:20:29,527 --> 00:20:31,229
what does this have
to do with us?

443
00:20:31,262 --> 00:20:32,564
The tracking label was fake,

444
00:20:32,597 --> 00:20:35,200
but the delivery address
of the container was yours,

445
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:37,035
so anyway you look at it

446
00:20:37,068 --> 00:20:38,636
we'd talk to you
about this body.

447
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,639
All the other ID, shipping
documents, country of origin,

448
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,441
all has to be verified.

449
00:20:43,474 --> 00:20:45,310
She could have
been placed inside

450
00:20:45,343 --> 00:20:46,578
at any point
along the way.

451
00:20:46,611 --> 00:20:48,313
- Was there
anything else

452
00:20:48,346 --> 00:20:49,647
found in the container?

453
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:53,184
- Nothing. Any idea
who she might be?

454
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:54,586
- No.

455
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:56,588
- Hmm... Do you
know of anyone

456
00:20:56,621 --> 00:20:58,990
who might have something
against your company,

457
00:20:59,023 --> 00:21:01,192
trying to send you
a message of some sort?

458
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:02,660
- (Whispering): No.

459
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:04,529
No. No?

460
00:21:04,562 --> 00:21:06,531
- Our company's
philosophy differs

461
00:21:06,564 --> 00:21:08,566
from a lot of
our competitors.

462
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,668
Some have expressed their
displeasure vocally,

463
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:13,404
but, I mean, none of them
would do it this far.

464
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,006
- No.

465
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,409
- Well, there's more questions
than answers at this point.

466
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,311
We'll contact you
when we know more.

467
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:21,546
And please let us know

468
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:24,249
if anything else out of
the ordinary comes up.

469
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:27,151
- OK. Anything we can
do to help.

470
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:28,152
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

471
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:35,460
(Door closing)

472
00:21:35,493 --> 00:21:36,961
(Sighing)

473
00:21:46,337 --> 00:21:47,305
(Siren)

474
00:21:47,338 --> 00:21:48,539
- What was that, Adam?

475
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,675
I mean, that was clearly
our label, our fabric.

476
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,377
Who would do
something like this?

477
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,544
- I don't know.
- And why?

478
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:54,679
- I don't know, Sophie.

479
00:21:54,712 --> 00:21:56,114
Maybe we got caught up

480
00:21:56,147 --> 00:21:58,049
in something we have
nothing to do with.

481
00:21:58,082 --> 00:22:00,752
- It's no random incident.
How is this connected to us?

482
00:22:00,785 --> 00:22:02,320
Oh!

483
00:22:02,353 --> 00:22:03,755
God, what is
wrong with me?

484
00:22:03,788 --> 00:22:05,290
- What?

485
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:10,061
- This could be somebody's
mother, somebody's daughter.

486
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:13,164
(Fire engine honking)

487
00:22:13,197 --> 00:22:14,599
(Sighing)

488
00:22:14,632 --> 00:22:16,768
- Listen, we'll know
more when they do.

489
00:22:16,801 --> 00:22:20,605
And then we'll deal
with it, together, OK?

490
00:22:23,174 --> 00:22:26,177
(Honking)

491
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:29,781
-
A near-tragedy at New York's
Port Authority earlier today

492
00:22:29,814 --> 00:22:33,685
led to the discovery of another
tragedy bizarrely interwoven

493
00:22:33,718 --> 00:22:36,587
with fledgling enviro-design
company Fyne Designs.

494
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:40,458
Question now is how will fair
trade becoming fear trade

495
00:22:40,491 --> 00:22:42,293
affect their
highly anticipated

496
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:45,063
flagship store opening
just 5 days away?

497
00:22:46,464 --> 00:22:48,132
- Have to prepare
a statement.

498
00:22:49,133 --> 00:22:50,635
- Saying what?

499
00:22:50,668 --> 00:22:53,071
- I don't know, Adam,
We have to say something.

500
00:22:53,104 --> 00:22:54,739
We gotta take control
of the situation.

501
00:22:54,772 --> 00:22:56,674
- No, we gotta stay
focused on the things

502
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,376
that we actually
can control.

503
00:22:58,409 --> 00:23:01,079
- Trying to make their lives
better and look what happens.

504
00:23:01,112 --> 00:23:02,547
(Sighing)

505
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,083
- Listen, we don't even
know what happen to her.

506
00:23:05,116 --> 00:23:08,319
- What about Katif, and probably
other suppliers, asking for COD?

507
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:09,620
How do we control that?

508
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:12,090
- It's just simple math,
more money going out

509
00:23:12,123 --> 00:23:13,791
than coming in
right now, that's all.

510
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:15,093
Oh.

511
00:23:16,127 --> 00:23:18,763
Uh... here.

512
00:23:18,796 --> 00:23:20,698
It's all straightened out.

513
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,568
Sophie, listen to me.

514
00:23:23,601 --> 00:23:25,336
It's just like this
in the beginning.

515
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:28,072
The work at the store, it's
never ever what it's quoted.

516
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:29,807
That's what I was
talking to Jerry about.

517
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:32,076
And the ad campaign,
I mean...

518
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,111
it's great...

519
00:23:33,144 --> 00:23:34,746
but it's a lot.

520
00:23:36,714 --> 00:23:39,617
- When did you say the shipment
is coming in? Our shipment?

521
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,819
- Yeah. The flight's
coming in day after next.

522
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:44,255
- Nothing like
cutting it close.

523
00:23:44,288 --> 00:23:45,423
- It's gonna be OK.

524
00:23:45,456 --> 00:23:46,424
(Sighing)

525
00:23:46,457 --> 00:23:47,425
(Telephone ringing)

526
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:49,160
- Hmm...

527
00:23:49,193 --> 00:23:52,130
(Ringing)

528
00:23:52,163 --> 00:23:53,331
- Thank you.

529
00:23:54,732 --> 00:23:55,833
Hello.

530
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:57,268
(Sighing)

531
00:23:57,301 --> 00:23:58,536
Yeah, got your message.

532
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:00,571
Yeah, I got a sample.

533
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:03,274
We're gonna have to
talk about new pricing.

534
00:24:03,307 --> 00:24:04,742
(Honking and sirens)

535
00:24:07,845 --> 00:24:08,813
Hey.

536
00:24:08,846 --> 00:24:09,814
(Sighing)

537
00:24:09,847 --> 00:24:10,815
Can't sleep?

538
00:24:10,848 --> 00:24:11,482
- (Spencer): No.

539
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:13,284
- Did you see it
in the news?

540
00:24:13,317 --> 00:24:14,452
- I was tweeted.

541
00:24:14,485 --> 00:24:17,188
- Listen, um,
everything's gonna be OK.

542
00:24:17,221 --> 00:24:19,323
There's nothing to
worry about, all right?

543
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:20,691
(Chuckles)

544
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:21,526
- Dad?

545
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:22,427
- Mm-hmm?

546
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,729
- What did mom do
to make you like her...

547
00:24:24,762 --> 00:24:25,563
love her?

548
00:24:25,596 --> 00:24:27,565
- What do you mean,
what did she do?

549
00:24:27,598 --> 00:24:29,567
- I mean, when
you guys first met,

550
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,636
did she talk or dress
in a certain way

551
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:33,171
that made you notice her?

552
00:24:33,204 --> 00:24:34,639
- Oh! Um...

553
00:24:37,508 --> 00:24:40,411
when I first met
your mother, it was, uh...

554
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:41,746
- Love at first sight?

555
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:42,447
- Oh no.

556
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,149
(Chuckling):
No, no, no, no.

557
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:48,219
It was more like
loathe at first sight.

558
00:24:48,252 --> 00:24:49,520
- What do you mean?

559
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:52,723
- It was the first
few days of our design school

560
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:55,660
and we were put in the same
group in marketing class,

561
00:24:55,693 --> 00:24:58,596
and our job-- our job was
just to make a business plan.

562
00:24:58,629 --> 00:25:01,732
That's it. But your mother--
Your mother, she was--

563
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:05,636
Well, you know, she's idealistic
and she's--she's stubborn.

564
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,605
- I must get the stubborn
part from her then.

565
00:25:07,638 --> 00:25:10,174
- For the record, you said that.
I did not say that.

566
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,209
- Yeah.

567
00:25:11,242 --> 00:25:12,643
- OK.

568
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:17,281
Those things at first,
they just-- They drove me nuts.

569
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:21,919
But those were the things that
made up who she was.

570
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:23,621
Who she is.

571
00:25:23,654 --> 00:25:27,592
An independent-thinking,

572
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:29,760
determined woman

573
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:31,929
who will never ever
take no for an answer

574
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:34,799
if there's even the slightest
possibility of a yes.

575
00:25:34,832 --> 00:25:37,935
So no, she never had to say
anything or do anything

576
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:40,905
or be anything other
than exactly what she was,

577
00:25:40,938 --> 00:25:44,175
because that's the person
I fell in love with.

578
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:47,945
(Chuckles)

579
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:50,348
So is there a reason
you're asking, or...

580
00:25:50,381 --> 00:25:51,649
- No reason.

581
00:25:51,682 --> 00:25:53,784
- No. No, no reason.
Of course not.

582
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:54,952
Mm-hmm?

583
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:55,953
(Giggles)

584
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:57,421
- I love you, Daddy.

585
00:25:57,455 --> 00:25:58,589
- I love you too.

586
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:00,558
Good night.

587
00:26:00,591 --> 00:26:02,260
- Can you leave that on?

588
00:26:02,293 --> 00:26:03,594
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

589
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:12,336
- Spencer, honey, wait up.
I'm going your way.

590
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:13,704
(♪ Muted music on earphones )

591
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,641
So when is there a moratorium
on hating her mother?

592
00:26:16,674 --> 00:26:18,242
- Oh, she doesn't hate you.

593
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:19,577
How can she?
She's just like you.

594
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:22,313
She's determined,
she's a perfectionist.

595
00:26:22,346 --> 00:26:23,314
- Really?
- Absolutely.

596
00:26:23,347 --> 00:26:24,815
And right now
she's determined

597
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:26,651
to make your life
a perfect hell.

598
00:26:26,684 --> 00:26:28,619
(♪ Muted music )

599
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:32,757
- Coming to work?

600
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,926
- I gotta run errands
for the opening.

601
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:36,294
- Oh. Uh-huh.

602
00:26:36,327 --> 00:26:37,562
(Cell phone beeping)

603
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:39,530
- She might get her
determination from me

604
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:41,465
but the ability to
tune me out is from you.

605
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:42,667
- Mm-hmm.

606
00:26:50,007 --> 00:26:51,475
- Spencer!

607
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:52,610
Spencer!
- Spencer!

608
00:26:59,016 --> 00:26:59,984
Spencer?

609
00:27:00,017 --> 00:27:01,485
Spencer.

610
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:02,753
You OK?

611
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:03,754
- What?

612
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:04,855
- Oh god!

613
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:05,656
- I'm fine! Why?

614
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,758
- Honey, you were
almost run over!

615
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,493
- What?

616
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:11,028
- Honey,
you can't walk around

617
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:12,430
in your own
little bubble.

618
00:27:12,463 --> 00:27:13,931
- We're serious
about this.

619
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,867
- OK! I'm sorry.

620
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:17,969
- Oh honey!

621
00:27:18,002 --> 00:27:19,804
(Panting)

622
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,974
(Honking)

623
00:27:24,675 --> 00:27:27,511
- Did you catch
the license plate number?

624
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:28,512
- No.

625
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:29,914
- No. No.

626
00:27:29,947 --> 00:27:31,048
- The make of the car?

627
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:32,650
- Um, black SUV.
American.

628
00:27:32,683 --> 00:27:36,520
- I might recognize the driver
if I saw him again.

629
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:38,322
- Listen, it just
happened so fast.

630
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:39,790
- Can't you do something?

631
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,627
Whoever this was, was trying
to run down our daughter.

632
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,629
- You're not giving me
a lot to go on here.

633
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:47,365
Maybe it wasn't intentional.

634
00:27:47,398 --> 00:27:49,667
(Both sighing)

635
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:53,471
Well, if any other details
come to mind, let me know.

636
00:27:53,504 --> 00:27:54,839
We'll see what we can do.

637
00:27:54,872 --> 00:27:56,040
(Pen clicking)

638
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:03,714
Would you mind if
I took some of these?

639
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:05,950
They'll be returned.

640
00:28:05,983 --> 00:28:07,585
- Yeah, of course.

641
00:28:12,456 --> 00:28:13,824
- Thank you.

642
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,626
(Honking)

643
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:23,000
- No! Crap!

644
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:25,870
(Sighing)

645
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:30,875
- Sophie.

646
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,978
- Claudio.

647
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,116
- Feeling the pressure of
a deadline, are we?

648
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,785
Or perhaps dead bodies?

649
00:28:40,818 --> 00:28:43,888
- Well, that's a little nasty
even for you, isn't it?

650
00:28:43,921 --> 00:28:44,955
- Hmm...

651
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:47,725
The quicker you rise
the faster you fall, my dear.

652
00:28:47,758 --> 00:28:50,094
The trick is not
to look down.

653
00:28:50,127 --> 00:28:52,663
- Fortunately, I'm not
afraid of heights, Claudio.

654
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:55,633
- You can design
a new wheel, Sophie,

655
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:57,134
but you can never
re-invent it.

656
00:28:57,168 --> 00:29:00,771
Best not to die trying.

657
00:29:05,476 --> 00:29:06,844
(Sighing)

658
00:29:18,222 --> 00:29:20,691
(Sighing)

659
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:29,934
- Hmm...

660
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,140
What the--

661
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:41,078
No. What the heck?

662
00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:47,618
(Honking in distance)

663
00:29:52,156 --> 00:29:53,924
- They're in!

664
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:54,692
- What's in?

665
00:29:54,725 --> 00:29:56,894
- The proofs
from the photo shoot.

666
00:29:56,927 --> 00:29:58,095
- Oh!

667
00:30:03,734 --> 00:30:05,803
Oh, these are good.

668
00:30:08,105 --> 00:30:11,108
These are really good.

669
00:30:17,681 --> 00:30:19,049
Oh my god!

670
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,053
(Sighing)

671
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:24,855
Spencer.

672
00:30:29,226 --> 00:30:31,662
Spencer!

673
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,698
Spencer!

674
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:36,233
- Hey! What's going on?

675
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:40,004
- This!

676
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,076
- Oh.

677
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,211
(Door opening)

678
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:50,181
- Spencer,
get over here now.

679
00:30:52,883 --> 00:30:56,520
- What's going on?
Why are you yelling?

680
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:57,888
- Recognize these?

681
00:30:59,623 --> 00:31:01,759
- Look. I know what
you're thinking.

682
00:31:03,727 --> 00:31:04,829
But I was fully dressed.

683
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:07,097
- (Adam):
Doesn't look that way.

684
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:10,601
- Your photographer thought
it would be fun.

685
00:31:10,634 --> 00:31:12,937
He used his computer
to put me in the picture.

686
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:14,839
- Why, Spencer?

687
00:31:14,872 --> 00:31:18,108
- To shock you into seeing how
good a model I could be.

688
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:19,610
- Shock me?
That's great!

689
00:31:19,643 --> 00:31:21,278
Why haven't you
answered your phone?

690
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:22,680
I've been calling.

691
00:31:22,713 --> 00:31:23,714
- I fainted.

692
00:31:23,747 --> 00:31:26,150
- What? Have you eaten anything?

693
00:31:26,183 --> 00:31:27,151
- I had an apple.

694
00:31:27,184 --> 00:31:28,252
I came home earlier

695
00:31:28,285 --> 00:31:30,254
but my keys didn't work.

696
00:31:30,287 --> 00:31:32,723
I was feeling kind of woozy,

697
00:31:32,756 --> 00:31:35,593
so I went to the park to sit
down and I guess I fainted.

698
00:31:35,626 --> 00:31:37,628
Next thing I know,
a man helps me up

699
00:31:37,661 --> 00:31:39,163
and insists on
taking me home.

700
00:31:39,196 --> 00:31:40,164
- Whoa. What man?

701
00:31:40,197 --> 00:31:41,165
- He said he knew you

702
00:31:41,198 --> 00:31:42,333
through business.

703
00:31:42,366 --> 00:31:44,068
A Mr. Cassadrian or something.

704
00:31:44,101 --> 00:31:45,903
He's out front.

705
00:31:45,936 --> 00:31:48,806
He said he would wait
to make sure I got in OK.

706
00:31:55,212 --> 00:31:56,647
(Inaudible)

707
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:04,288
- You're not eating to
the point of passing out,

708
00:32:04,321 --> 00:32:06,123
and now this photo
stunt you pulled!

709
00:32:06,156 --> 00:32:07,758
What are you
thinking, Spencer?

710
00:32:07,791 --> 00:32:10,194
You're so grounded.
Give me the cell phone.

711
00:32:10,227 --> 00:32:12,162
- What?
- Cell phone.

712
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:13,197
- Daddy!
- Cell phone.

713
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,231
(Scoffing)

714
00:32:18,335 --> 00:32:19,770
(Sighing)

715
00:32:22,873 --> 00:32:24,642
(Slams)

716
00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:31,115
- Maybe we should cut her
a little slack, huh?

717
00:32:31,148 --> 00:32:32,283
- She's starving herself.

718
00:32:32,316 --> 00:32:33,284
- I know.

719
00:32:33,317 --> 00:32:35,052
- She went behind
my back to model

720
00:32:35,085 --> 00:32:37,688
and now she could have
ended up with God knows who?

721
00:32:37,721 --> 00:32:38,989
She's smarter
than this.

722
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:40,124
- Yes, she is.

723
00:32:40,157 --> 00:32:43,627
She's just trying to find
a way to get what she wants.

724
00:32:44,261 --> 00:32:46,096
It's not so bad.

725
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,865
(Sighing)

726
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:50,234
(Sighing)

727
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:56,106
(Sighing)

728
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,909
- I don't know anyone
named Cassadrian, do you?

729
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:00,311
- No.

730
00:33:00,344 --> 00:33:01,912
(♪ Rock on stereo )

731
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:03,180
(Sighing)

732
00:33:03,213 --> 00:33:04,315
- I'll handle it.

733
00:33:04,348 --> 00:33:05,316
- Thank you.

734
00:33:05,349 --> 00:33:06,717
- OK.

735
00:33:14,925 --> 00:33:15,893
- Hey!

736
00:33:15,926 --> 00:33:17,061
- Hey!

737
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:19,229
- All right.

738
00:33:22,366 --> 00:33:24,234
Hey, is there
any word from Ian yet?

739
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:25,402
- Yeah. He's on
his way back.

740
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:26,403
- When?

741
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:27,204
- Any day now.

742
00:33:27,237 --> 00:33:29,406
- Any day?
How non-committal is that?

743
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,408
He's gonna be here
for the show, right?

744
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:32,943
- Yes.

745
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:34,979
He will be here
for the show.

746
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,948
I gotta go check
on some customs specs

747
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:39,850
and then I got
a meeting at the bank.

748
00:33:39,883 --> 00:33:41,151
- OK.
- See you tonight?

749
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,453
- All right.

750
00:33:42,486 --> 00:33:44,288
- Sophie, I've been
getting calls

751
00:33:44,321 --> 00:33:46,023
from the press.

752
00:33:46,056 --> 00:33:48,859
Would you have time to go over
the seating arrangements?

753
00:33:48,892 --> 00:33:50,294
- Wait! Sorry, sorry.
Adam, Adam!

754
00:33:50,327 --> 00:33:52,062
- But they're
calling me. I can't--

755
00:33:53,864 --> 00:33:54,999
Adam!

756
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:58,669
- Thank you.

757
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:02,039
(Both laughing)

758
00:34:02,072 --> 00:34:03,741
- Very appreciative.

759
00:34:03,774 --> 00:34:04,908
- See ya later.

760
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:05,943
- Bye.

761
00:34:16,787 --> 00:34:18,922
Oh, for god sake!

762
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:20,791
Hey!

763
00:34:20,824 --> 00:34:24,695
Who the hell are you and why
have you been following me?

764
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,698
- He's with me.

765
00:34:29,066 --> 00:34:30,968
- Agent Marks. FBI.

766
00:34:38,809 --> 00:34:40,277
- You want something?

767
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,812
- No.

768
00:34:41,845 --> 00:34:43,781
- Two coffees.
Thank you.

769
00:34:43,814 --> 00:34:46,750
- What is your relationship
with Mr. Ian Jameson?

770
00:34:47,851 --> 00:34:50,087
He's our business partner
and friend.

771
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,221
- Is that all?

772
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,190
- Why have you been stalking me?

773
00:34:53,223 --> 00:34:54,525
- Oh, just wanted to see

774
00:34:54,558 --> 00:34:58,228
if you'd had any
contact with Mr. Jameson.

775
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,830
- And what did you see?

776
00:34:59,863 --> 00:35:01,965
- That you didn't...
physically.

777
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:03,767
- Does Ian have
something to do

778
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:05,969
with the body that
was in the container?

779
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:08,839
- This situation has become
a little complicated

780
00:35:08,872 --> 00:35:11,475
and we thought you could
help us clarify a few things.

781
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:15,412
- Thank you.

782
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:20,117
How about Mr. Jameson
and your husband?

783
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,985
How do they get along?

784
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:24,221
- Like brothers, with the
occasional rivalry.

785
00:35:24,254 --> 00:35:26,523
Men and their egos.
But they make a good team.

786
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:28,158
All 3 of us do.

787
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:29,359
- Any conflicts?

788
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:31,228
- We're partners
with the demands

789
00:35:31,261 --> 00:35:32,296
of a growing business

790
00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:33,363
in a competitive industry.

791
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:35,165
Of course there are conflicts,

792
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,433
but there are resolutions.

793
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,569
- Any reason to
think otherwise?

794
00:35:38,602 --> 00:35:42,573
- We each have certain strengths
and weaknesses. Don't you?

795
00:35:42,606 --> 00:35:45,542
- How involved are you in each
other's sides of the company?

796
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:48,178
- We consult and
keep each other informed

797
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:49,847
on the overall activities,

798
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,381
but we each have clearly

799
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:53,417
our day-to-day
responsibilities and tasks.

800
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:56,887
I mean, if we kept our hands in
each other's work all the time,

801
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,989
we'd never get
anything done, would we?

802
00:35:59,022 --> 00:36:01,492
- Has your husband had any
dealings with anyone new?

803
00:36:01,525 --> 00:36:03,427
- My husband handles
our finances.

804
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,530
He's constantly dealing
with people I don't know.

805
00:36:06,563 --> 00:36:08,198
Look, we're both
extremely busy.

806
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:11,034
I don't keep tabs on every
person my husband deals with

807
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:13,504
while managing our accounts
and balancing our books.

808
00:36:13,537 --> 00:36:16,039
Nor does he check to see
which buttons I choose.

809
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:17,274
We trust each other.

810
00:36:17,307 --> 00:36:20,043
- Do you know if
your husband's heard

811
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:22,279
from Mr. Jameson
since their trip?

812
00:36:22,312 --> 00:36:24,581
- Why don't you
ask my husband that?

813
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:31,922
Do I need to
call my lawyer?

814
00:36:31,955 --> 00:36:33,056
- No.

815
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,091
- Then I'm free to go?

816
00:36:35,192 --> 00:36:36,560
(Sighing)

817
00:36:36,593 --> 00:36:39,229
- If you do come across
anything else unexpected,

818
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:42,199
it would be in the best interest
of you and your family

819
00:36:42,232 --> 00:36:43,233
to give us a call.

820
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:47,971
- Just be careful
who you trust, Ms. Fyne.

821
00:36:57,247 --> 00:36:59,216
- Adam, we need to talk.

822
00:37:00,684 --> 00:37:03,153
Fine, but don't be home
too late, all right?

823
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:04,521
I'll see you there.

824
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:42,559
(Approaching footsteps)

825
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:49,566
Spencer...

826
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,302
Come here.
Sit with me.

827
00:37:55,138 --> 00:37:56,473
Please.

828
00:37:57,474 --> 00:37:59,142
Sit.

829
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:11,555
I know I've been really hard
on you the last few weeks.

830
00:38:11,588 --> 00:38:13,657
God knows you've
given me reason.

831
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:14,925
But...

832
00:38:16,326 --> 00:38:18,662
there's a lot going on
with us right now.

833
00:38:18,695 --> 00:38:22,099
But I've had no right to take
that frustration out on you.

834
00:38:22,132 --> 00:38:23,700
So I'm sorry.

835
00:38:27,404 --> 00:38:29,706
- There's this boy
at school, Justin.

836
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:33,543
We're always joking
around and texting and...

837
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:35,946
- And?

838
00:38:37,614 --> 00:38:40,550
- He asked Melanie to
the end-of-the-year dance.

839
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,253
- And Melanie is...

840
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:44,288
- A model.

841
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:46,456
- So you think
if you model,

842
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,625
that'll get Justin
to ask you out?

843
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:53,130
- Whatever. I don't know.

844
00:38:54,164 --> 00:38:56,066
(Chuckles)

845
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,503
- Your great-great-
grandmother, Ella,

846
00:38:59,536 --> 00:39:02,306
used to clean Coco Chanel's
studio at night.

847
00:39:03,573 --> 00:39:06,009
And she would pull the
sketches out of the trash can

848
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:07,210
and collect them.

849
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:08,645
Eventually,
Chanel caught on,

850
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,248
so she started leaving
her discarded sketches

851
00:39:11,281 --> 00:39:12,449
out on purpose

852
00:39:12,482 --> 00:39:14,418
in a nice,
neat pile for her.

853
00:39:14,451 --> 00:39:16,286
And these were
Ella's favourites.

854
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,288
- I've heard that story,
a hundred times.

855
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:20,324
- Not this part.

856
00:39:20,357 --> 00:39:23,760
In France, at that time, once
you were considered one thing,

857
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:27,197
it was almost impossible
to become something else.

858
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:30,500
Ella wanted to be a designer,
but she never had that choice.

859
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:33,537
So when I became
a designer,

860
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:37,374
it was in part to honour
my great-grandmother,

861
00:39:37,407 --> 00:39:40,210
but mostly,
the choice was mine.

862
00:39:42,112 --> 00:39:43,213
(Chuckling)

863
00:39:43,246 --> 00:39:47,117
That photo stunt you pulled,
it showed your creativity...

864
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,452
(Clears throat)

865
00:39:48,485 --> 00:39:50,087
...and a hell of
a lot of chutzpah.

866
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:53,190
And those are exceptional
qualities at any age,

867
00:39:53,223 --> 00:39:56,226
impressively so at yours.

868
00:39:56,259 --> 00:39:59,262
So for the show,
you can model.

869
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:02,399
But it has to be a choice
that you're making for you,

870
00:40:02,432 --> 00:40:04,568
not for Justin,
or anybody else.

871
00:40:05,769 --> 00:40:07,637
And...

872
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:15,812
Oh, but part of the deal,
you have to start eating again.

873
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:17,681
- Deal.

874
00:40:17,714 --> 00:40:18,548
- OK.

875
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,250
(Chuckling)

876
00:40:21,284 --> 00:40:23,253
(Knocking)

877
00:40:23,286 --> 00:40:24,521
Let me get that.

878
00:40:36,733 --> 00:40:39,536
Knocking on doors now,
instead of hiding behind them?

879
00:40:39,569 --> 00:40:41,505
- Ms. Fyne.

880
00:40:41,538 --> 00:40:44,241
Sorry to bother you.
May we come in?

881
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:55,085
- Thank you.

882
00:40:56,219 --> 00:40:57,421
- Thank you.

883
00:40:57,454 --> 00:40:59,456
- So what time do you
expect him home?

884
00:40:59,489 --> 00:41:01,591
- He should be
here any minute.

885
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:04,795
I-- I'm sorry.
Why are you here?

886
00:41:04,828 --> 00:41:07,330
- The female "vic"
from that container,

887
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:08,598
name's Riyana Mingell.

888
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:11,435
Any idea why we found
your husband's DNA

889
00:41:11,468 --> 00:41:13,570
under her finger nails?

890
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:18,742
- Hey!

891
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:29,319
(Siren)

892
00:41:31,221 --> 00:41:32,789
- And how did you get
my clients' DNA

893
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,758
without their knowledge
or co-operation?

894
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:37,327
- They sipped water
and left their glasses.

895
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,229
It's discarded
genetic material.

896
00:41:39,262 --> 00:41:41,465
With reasonable doubt,
we can do whatever.

897
00:41:41,498 --> 00:41:43,467
- Surreptitious
sampling violates

898
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,602
their constitutional
right to privacy.

899
00:41:45,635 --> 00:41:48,205
- When people don't clean up
after themselves, we do.

900
00:41:48,238 --> 00:41:51,575
I just happened to take
a closer look at the garbage.

901
00:41:51,608 --> 00:41:52,876
- I can explain this.

902
00:41:52,909 --> 00:41:54,444
- No, Adam!
- I can explain.

903
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:55,912
I tripped.

904
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:59,649
I fell backward onto a textile
tool and it punctured me.

905
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,384
Right here.

906
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,287
She helped clean me up.

907
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:07,457
That's probably why my DNA
was under her finger nails.

908
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:08,525
That's it.

909
00:42:08,558 --> 00:42:10,660
- Yeah? Prove it.

910
00:42:11,828 --> 00:42:12,896
(Scoffs)

911
00:42:12,929 --> 00:42:15,665
- No. Look, he doesn't have
to show you anything, OK?

912
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,400
- I never took
home-ec in school,

913
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:18,735
but you obviously did.

914
00:42:18,768 --> 00:42:21,671
I just don't get how
you'd sew your own label

915
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:24,541
into the same fabric
you used to kill her.

916
00:42:24,574 --> 00:42:26,510
- OK, you're out
of line, Fincher.

917
00:42:26,543 --> 00:42:28,278
- She worked for us.
That's it.

918
00:42:28,311 --> 00:42:29,913
I had no reason
to kill her.

919
00:42:29,946 --> 00:42:33,283
And whoever did obviously did
it shortly after she helped me.

920
00:42:33,316 --> 00:42:34,417
That's all.

921
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:36,419
- Are you prepared
to press charges?

922
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:38,655
- There are
witnesses to this?

923
00:42:38,688 --> 00:42:40,757
- About 35 very
hard-working women

924
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:43,827
at our dye factory in Marrakesh,
near Riyana's village.

925
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:46,730
- You gonna collect DNA
from their garbage as well?

926
00:42:48,498 --> 00:42:51,301
- Either you're
extremely clumsy

927
00:42:51,334 --> 00:42:53,270
or one hell of a liar.

928
00:42:55,605 --> 00:42:58,208
You can go,
but not too far.

929
00:43:10,453 --> 00:43:12,289
- Listen, if they
call you again,

930
00:43:12,322 --> 00:43:13,390
you don't talk to them, OK?

931
00:43:13,423 --> 00:43:14,591
You call me first.

932
00:43:16,426 --> 00:43:17,994
(Sighing)

933
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:18,995
(Car alarm in distance)

934
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:21,665
- Thank you. Thank you
for your support in there.

935
00:43:21,698 --> 00:43:23,466
Thank you
for believing me.

936
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,468
- I'm just not sure what
I believe right now

937
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:27,003
with everything
that's going on.

938
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:28,471
We're trying so hard

939
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:30,507
to do things in
a new way, the right way,

940
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,709
and this goes against
everything we stand for.

941
00:43:32,742 --> 00:43:34,945
- There's gotta be
some logical explanation.

942
00:43:34,978 --> 00:43:38,014
- There's nothing logical about
this, Adam. Riyana's dead.

943
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:39,749
(Sighing)

944
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:42,319
You know the FBI came
to see me earlier today too,

945
00:43:42,352 --> 00:43:44,821
asking questions about you
and the company and Ian,

946
00:43:44,854 --> 00:43:47,057
and that's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

947
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:48,525
And then this happened.

948
00:43:48,558 --> 00:43:50,360
Like, just--
What is going on, Adam?

949
00:43:50,393 --> 00:43:53,597
- I don't know, Sophie,
but I will figure this out.

950
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:55,365
I promise you.
I need more time.

951
00:43:55,398 --> 00:43:57,300
(Car honking in distance)

952
00:43:57,334 --> 00:44:00,370
Trust me, I'm doing
everything I possibly can

953
00:44:00,403 --> 00:44:01,905
to keep our family safe.

954
00:44:01,938 --> 00:44:03,306
- Safe from who?

955
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,508
- Sophie... please.

956
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:07,711
Trust me.

957
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,015
(Cell phone ringing)

958
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:19,489
- Why aren't you answering?

959
00:44:19,522 --> 00:44:21,391
- Listen,
It's not important.

960
00:44:21,424 --> 00:44:23,860
Come on, let's...
Let's go.

961
00:44:25,428 --> 00:44:27,297
(Cars honking in distance)

962
00:44:28,965 --> 00:44:32,669
-
Endangering the very same
women they're trying to help,

963
00:44:32,702 --> 00:44:35,338
as C.F.O. Adam Fyne remains
the prime suspect

964
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:38,842
in the death of one of their
company's fair-trade workers.

965
00:44:38,875 --> 00:44:41,645
So with their inaugural
fashion show and flagship store

966
00:44:41,678 --> 00:44:43,079
opening just 2 days away,

967
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:45,582
will Fyne Designs
be shutting their doors

968
00:44:45,615 --> 00:44:47,350
before they even open at all?

969
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:48,351
(Sighing)

970
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:49,686
- Alexa, can you please try

971
00:44:49,719 --> 00:44:51,955
to reach Mrs. Bashiri
in Fez for me, please?

972
00:44:51,988 --> 00:44:53,089
- Of course.

973
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:54,791
(Drill whirring)

974
00:44:54,824 --> 00:44:56,960
- The rice-paper
price tickets arrived.

975
00:44:56,993 --> 00:44:58,428
- Is Adam here?

976
00:44:58,461 --> 00:45:00,030
- He stepped out
for a few minutes.

977
00:45:00,063 --> 00:45:02,065
Said he'd be right back.

978
00:45:02,098 --> 00:45:03,400
- Thanks.

979
00:45:03,433 --> 00:45:05,001
(Man talking, indistinct)

980
00:45:11,007 --> 00:45:12,075
- Excuse me.

981
00:45:14,077 --> 00:45:17,013
- Sophie, I have
Mrs. Bashiri on line one.

982
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,682
- Thank you.

983
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:27,624
(Talking, indistinct)

984
00:45:28,758 --> 00:45:30,760
- Mrs. Bashiri,
it's Sophie Fyne.

985
00:45:31,961 --> 00:45:35,565
Please extend our
condolences to Riyana's family

986
00:45:35,598 --> 00:45:37,934
and let us know if there's
anything that we can do.

987
00:45:39,969 --> 00:45:42,772
No, I just wish that Ian had
mentioned that she was missing

988
00:45:42,806 --> 00:45:45,141
when he was there to talk
to you about the dye lots.

989
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:46,142
(Hammering)

990
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:47,644
I'm sorry?

991
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:51,648
He wasn't there?

992
00:45:53,516 --> 00:45:56,720
I'm sorry.
Uh, I-- I have to go.

993
00:46:07,063 --> 00:46:08,965
(Line ringing)

994
00:46:08,998 --> 00:46:11,201
(Cell phone ringing)

995
00:46:11,234 --> 00:46:13,670
(Line ringing
and cell phone ringing)

996
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,645
- Hey!

997
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:26,216
It's missing.
Our container is missing.

998
00:46:26,249 --> 00:46:27,784
There was a document error.

999
00:46:27,817 --> 00:46:29,919
It was rerouted and
now we cannot locate it.

1000
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:33,790
- Ian never went back to Fez.
Why did you tell me he did?

1001
00:46:33,823 --> 00:46:36,826
- I told you he'd try.
Turns out he didn't have time,

1002
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:39,929
so he sent in his approval
based on Mrs. Bashiri's opinion.

1003
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,798
Simple as that.

1004
00:46:41,831 --> 00:46:42,799
- Why isn't
he here now?

1005
00:46:42,832 --> 00:46:46,069
- He's on his way back.
- Is he walking back?

1006
00:46:46,102 --> 00:46:47,203
- Sophie, come on.

1007
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:49,773
- Adam, Why do you
have Ian's cell phone?

1008
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,547
- You all right?

1009
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:59,048
- You OK?
You all right?

1010
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:00,550
- Yeah.

1011
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:02,919
- (Man): The guy's
working on it.

1012
00:47:02,952 --> 00:47:03,920
- OK. All right.

1013
00:47:03,953 --> 00:47:05,088
- What happened?

1014
00:47:05,121 --> 00:47:06,189
(Many men shouting)

1015
00:47:06,222 --> 00:47:07,791
- I'm gonna check
the main panel.

1016
00:47:07,824 --> 00:47:10,226
- Wow. You're going to
the hospital, all right?

1017
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,595
Come on.
You're coming too.

1018
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:13,963
- Adam--
- Call 911.

1019
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,699
- Check to make sure
no one else is hurt.

1020
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:25,642
(Approaching siren)

1021
00:47:28,845 --> 00:47:32,582
- (Police officer): All right,
behind the yellow line, please.

1022
00:47:32,615 --> 00:47:33,583
- Thank you.

1023
00:47:33,616 --> 00:47:35,051
- (Officer):
Just stay back.

1024
00:47:35,084 --> 00:47:36,085
- What are we gonna do?

1025
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:38,254
- What we're not gonna
do is panic, all right?

1026
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:41,224
The press needs to know that
everything is on schedule.

1027
00:47:41,257 --> 00:47:42,258
We're opening
as planned.

1028
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:43,827
- OK.

1029
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:44,994
(Sighing)

1030
00:47:46,696 --> 00:47:48,898
- He seems OK.

1031
00:48:04,881 --> 00:48:06,115
- Excuse me.

1032
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:20,630
- Spencer!

1033
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,766
(Tires squealing)

1034
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:36,880
(Inaudible)

1035
00:49:35,104 --> 00:49:36,606
(Clattering)

1036
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:40,843
(Sighing)

1037
00:49:40,877 --> 00:49:41,878
Oh, Jerry.

1038
00:49:41,911 --> 00:49:43,079
- Mrs. Fyne.

1039
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:46,716
You shouldn't be in here.
It's dangerous.

1040
00:49:46,749 --> 00:49:49,018
- So they think
the explosion was caused

1041
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:51,788
by an electrical problem
with the old wiring?

1042
00:49:51,821 --> 00:49:54,724
- I've been a licensed
electrician for over 26 years,

1043
00:49:54,757 --> 00:49:56,926
and I can tell you
there's nothing wrong

1044
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,861
with the wiring
in this building.

1045
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:01,864
- Accidents can
happen, right?

1046
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:03,666
- This was not
an accident.

1047
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,335
- Jerry, I'm so sorry
about your guys,

1048
00:50:05,368 --> 00:50:06,803
but you know
our situation.

1049
00:50:06,836 --> 00:50:08,404
Is there any way that

1050
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:10,173
you can still get
the store done

1051
00:50:10,206 --> 00:50:11,708
in time for
the opening?

1052
00:50:11,741 --> 00:50:14,911
- Well, my team was lightened
by 2... 2 of my best.

1053
00:50:15,912 --> 00:50:17,880
Listen, the way
that things are going

1054
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:20,016
in this city
at the moment,

1055
00:50:20,049 --> 00:50:21,451
I could get 2 more men.

1056
00:50:21,484 --> 00:50:24,721
In fact, I could get you
10 more men.

1057
00:50:24,754 --> 00:50:29,158
You know, they'd be
hard-working and eager.

1058
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,259
- Great.

1059
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:31,427
- But I won't.

1060
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:33,162
- What?

1061
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,465
- I like you, Mrs. Fyne,

1062
00:50:35,498 --> 00:50:39,102
but, uh, none of us
have been paid in weeks.

1063
00:50:40,436 --> 00:50:42,872
So we won't be hammering
anymore nails here,

1064
00:50:42,905 --> 00:50:46,843
or hanging anymore sheetrock
till we see some money.

1065
00:50:52,448 --> 00:50:54,684
(Cell phone ringing)

1066
00:50:58,054 --> 00:50:59,188
(Sighing)

1067
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:01,791
(Ringing)

1068
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:04,227
- Hello.

1069
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:07,497
-Ms. Fyne? This is Mrs. Lawson
from Liberty Mutual.

1070
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:09,799
We can't seem
to reach your husband

1071
00:51:09,832 --> 00:51:12,101
and there seems to be
a bit of a problem.

1072
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:18,808
- I-- I don't understand.

1073
00:51:18,841 --> 00:51:20,943
- Company credit line
is fully drawn,

1074
00:51:20,977 --> 00:51:23,212
as well as the personal
lines of credit

1075
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,947
in your name and Mr. Fyne's.

1076
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:27,417
- That can't be. The company
line, I understand.

1077
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:29,185
We've had a lot
of expenses.

1078
00:51:29,218 --> 00:51:30,753
You have more credit cards

1079
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:33,156
than just the 2
with this institution.

1080
00:51:33,189 --> 00:51:35,792
These are difficult
times for everyone.

1081
00:51:35,825 --> 00:51:38,027
Your situation isn't
different from other people--

1082
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:39,962
- Could you check
our retirement funds?

1083
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:41,731
- I have.
There's nothing there.

1084
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:44,434
- How is that possible?

1085
00:51:44,467 --> 00:51:46,769
I see that all
processed transactions

1086
00:51:46,803 --> 00:51:48,905
included the
3 required signatures:

1087
00:51:48,938 --> 00:51:51,507
yours, your husband's
and Mr. Jameson's.

1088
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:53,976
May I see some of
these documents, please?

1089
00:51:56,879 --> 00:51:58,881
- I never signed that. I--

1090
00:52:00,016 --> 00:52:01,250
Or that.

1091
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,119
- But this is your signature?

1092
00:52:03,152 --> 00:52:04,921
- Yeah.

1093
00:52:07,023 --> 00:52:08,091
And your loft.

1094
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:11,427
You are aware that the bank
has put a lien on it?

1095
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:13,129
A mortgage default,
past 4 months.

1096
00:52:13,162 --> 00:52:15,398
Strange. Oh, it seems an
extremely large deposit

1097
00:52:15,431 --> 00:52:17,533
was made into one
of your accounts

1098
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:20,002
and then almost
immediately withdrawn.

1099
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:21,237
- How large?

1100
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:22,371
- $2 million.
- What?

1101
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:25,274
- The transaction
happened too quickly

1102
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:27,009
to have been red-flagged.

1103
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:30,379
But an amount this substantial
does warrant an investigation,

1104
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:32,315
especially if it's
no longer there.

1105
00:52:32,348 --> 00:52:33,783
(Sighing)

1106
00:52:39,555 --> 00:52:41,891
(Keys turning in door)

1107
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:49,298
- Where is it, Adam?
Where's the damn money?

1108
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:54,570
(Sighing)

1109
00:52:54,604 --> 00:52:58,808
- Ian took it.
He took the whole thing.

1110
00:52:59,442 --> 00:53:00,910
- What?

1111
00:53:00,943 --> 00:53:02,311
- That's why
he disappeared.

1112
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:04,580
He did the bank
transactions online

1113
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:08,151
and he forged the originals,
couriered them back and forth.

1114
00:53:08,184 --> 00:53:09,919
And then he disappeared.

1115
00:53:09,952 --> 00:53:13,322
I backtracked, went back to
his hotel room, looking for him.

1116
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:14,857
All I found
was his cell phone.

1117
00:53:14,891 --> 00:53:16,993
That was it.
I've had it ever since.

1118
00:53:17,026 --> 00:53:19,295
- Doesn't make any sense.
Why would Ian do that?

1119
00:53:19,328 --> 00:53:20,563
- I don't know.

1120
00:53:22,565 --> 00:53:25,134
- It's Cassadrian,
isn't it?

1121
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:28,070
Armand Cassadrian, the man who
helped Spencer in the park.

1122
00:53:28,104 --> 00:53:30,039
The driver that tried
to run her over,

1123
00:53:30,072 --> 00:53:32,909
he had something to do
with the blast in the store.

1124
00:53:32,942 --> 00:53:34,544
He was with Cassadrian
right after.

1125
00:53:34,577 --> 00:53:36,479
Is this connected
to Riyana's death?

1126
00:53:36,512 --> 00:53:38,214
Is this-- Is Ian
involved in this?

1127
00:53:38,247 --> 00:53:39,215
- I don't know, Sophie.

1128
00:53:39,248 --> 00:53:41,117
I don't know.

1129
00:53:42,985 --> 00:53:44,220
(Sighing)

1130
00:53:44,253 --> 00:53:45,621
- And the $2 million?

1131
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:48,090
- The $2 million, it was
deposited and withdrawn

1132
00:53:48,124 --> 00:53:49,492
in a blink.

1133
00:53:49,525 --> 00:53:51,360
I don't know
where it came from.

1134
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:54,096
I don't know
where it went.

1135
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:55,198
(Sighing)

1136
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:56,499
- They're investigating.

1137
00:53:56,532 --> 00:53:58,334
- I know. Lawson called me

1138
00:53:58,367 --> 00:54:00,436
after she talked to you.

1139
00:54:00,469 --> 00:54:02,071
- You should have told me.

1140
00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:08,211
You should have told me.

1141
00:54:15,284 --> 00:54:16,619
(Sighing)

1142
00:54:16,652 --> 00:54:19,222
- Come on. Give me some
good news, Phil. Please.

1143
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:22,058
-
They got it. Eye-witness
testimony backing your story.

1144
00:54:22,091 --> 00:54:23,693
Investigation's
being transferred

1145
00:54:23,726 --> 00:54:25,661
to the local authorities.

1146
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:27,563
It's probably
a domestic situation:

1147
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,699
husband mad at
his wife for working

1148
00:54:29,732 --> 00:54:30,900
or mad at the company

1149
00:54:30,933 --> 00:54:33,970
for allowing women
to be independent, what--

1150
00:54:34,003 --> 00:54:36,072
Anyway, everyone
saw her help  you

1151
00:54:36,105 --> 00:54:38,140
and no one
saw her get killed.

1152
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:39,175
- Great. Thanks Phil.

1153
00:54:39,208 --> 00:54:40,977
(Beep)

1154
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:44,146
- I know that's supposed to be
comforting information,

1155
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,514
but it's not.

1156
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:47,450
- Sophie, we cannot save
the entire world

1157
00:54:47,483 --> 00:54:48,484
with one sewing job.

1158
00:54:48,517 --> 00:54:49,485
(Sighing)

1159
00:54:49,518 --> 00:54:51,287
You know, maybe we should

1160
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,688
just cancel the show,

1161
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:54,557
you know,
delay the opening.

1162
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:56,726
- Hey, we have done
nothing wrong, all right?

1163
00:54:56,759 --> 00:55:01,097
We've worked too hard and
come too far to just give up.

1164
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:04,500
The timing is crucial to
the launch of the ad campaign.

1165
00:55:04,533 --> 00:55:06,269
Listen,
Ian took the money.

1166
00:55:06,302 --> 00:55:08,537
You know what?
It's replaceable.

1167
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:10,673
Opportunities like this aren't.

1168
00:55:10,706 --> 00:55:13,042
We got one chance
to make a first impression

1169
00:55:13,075 --> 00:55:15,444
on the fashion world
and make it an unforgettable.

1170
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:16,545
- With what, huh?

1171
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:17,546
No merchandise.

1172
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:18,581
Our store is a wreck.

1173
00:55:18,614 --> 00:55:20,182
We don't have any money

1174
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:21,317
to pay Jerry to fix it--

1175
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:22,752
- Hey.

1176
00:55:22,785 --> 00:55:23,719
(Sighing)

1177
00:55:25,554 --> 00:55:29,258
OK, I'll rearrange
for the second shipment

1178
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:30,726
to arrive by plane.

1179
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,596
With any luck, maybe it'll
arrive today. Right?

1180
00:55:33,629 --> 00:55:36,198
And the broker might be able
to expedite clearance,

1181
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:38,467
get it to the warehouse
by this afternoon.

1182
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,736
And then I could
go to the bank

1183
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:43,339
and I can plead for some
emergency bridge financing.

1184
00:55:43,372 --> 00:55:44,540
And...

1185
00:55:45,541 --> 00:55:47,076
(Sighing)

1186
00:55:47,109 --> 00:55:50,579
- We're gonna make this work
and we're gonna be OK.

1187
00:55:52,248 --> 00:55:53,749
Don't shut me
out again.

1188
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:56,018
Right?

1189
00:55:56,052 --> 00:55:57,653
- OK.

1190
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:06,329
- Mom, have you
seen my bag?

1191
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:08,064
- It's by to the couch
where you--

1192
00:56:08,097 --> 00:56:09,131
- Oh, where I left it.

1193
00:56:17,139 --> 00:56:18,541
Are you OK?

1194
00:56:18,574 --> 00:56:21,143
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.

1195
00:56:21,177 --> 00:56:22,211
- You're a great designer.

1196
00:56:22,244 --> 00:56:24,780
And for the most part,
you're a pretty decent mom,

1197
00:56:24,814 --> 00:56:27,750
but you're not much
of a liar.

1198
00:56:29,151 --> 00:56:30,786
- And that's a bad thing?

1199
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:33,723
- Is everything all right
with you and Dad?

1200
00:56:33,756 --> 00:56:37,393
- Oh, you heard us
arguing last night.

1201
00:56:37,426 --> 00:56:38,394
- No.

1202
00:56:38,427 --> 00:56:40,196
Kind of.

1203
00:56:40,229 --> 00:56:41,530
Yeah.

1204
00:56:42,865 --> 00:56:45,134
- We're fine.

1205
00:56:45,167 --> 00:56:46,135
- Oh, I gotta go.

1206
00:56:46,168 --> 00:56:47,703
- Bye.

1207
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:48,537
- Eating!

1208
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:50,039
Bye, Mom.

1209
00:57:06,822 --> 00:57:08,624
(Birds chirping)

1210
00:57:10,393 --> 00:57:12,261
- Drea.
Hey, it's me.

1211
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:16,165
Yeah, I need a favour.

1212
00:57:20,469 --> 00:57:21,804
- $200,000.
Going once...

1213
00:57:23,205 --> 00:57:25,441
going twice...

1214
00:57:25,474 --> 00:57:27,443
(Gavel hitting podium)

1215
00:57:27,476 --> 00:57:30,513
And lot number 51
is sold for $200,000.

1216
00:57:35,551 --> 00:57:38,854
Next on the block
is a unique collection

1217
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:42,324
of original fashion
sketches by Coco Chanel.

1218
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:45,561
Dating 1925 to 1932.

1219
00:57:45,594 --> 00:57:49,231
Opening bid:
$150,000.

1220
00:57:50,466 --> 00:57:52,868
We have an offer
of $150,000.

1221
00:57:52,902 --> 00:57:55,571
Do we have an offer
of $200,000?

1222
00:57:57,373 --> 00:57:59,308
We have an offer
of $200,000.

1223
00:57:59,341 --> 00:58:02,244
Do we have an offer
of $250,000?

1224
00:58:03,512 --> 00:58:05,481
We have an offer
of $250,000.

1225
00:58:05,514 --> 00:58:07,850
Do we have an offer
of $300,000?

1226
00:58:09,785 --> 00:58:11,353
- OK.

1227
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:13,456
- We have an offer
of $300,000.

1228
00:58:13,489 --> 00:58:15,558
Do we have an offer
of $350,000?

1229
00:58:18,394 --> 00:58:21,497
We have an offer of $350,000.

1230
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:23,799
Do we have an offer
of $400,000?

1231
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:32,508
$350,000, going once,

1232
00:58:32,541 --> 00:58:34,176
going twice...

1233
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:37,613
And the Chanel collection
of original sketches

1234
00:58:37,646 --> 00:58:40,182
is sold for $350,000.

1235
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:41,550
(Sighing)

1236
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:49,558
(Sighing)

1237
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:52,428
- You didn't have to
give up your book.

1238
00:58:52,461 --> 00:58:54,463
We could have
found another way.

1239
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:55,798
Not in time, we couldn't.

1240
00:58:55,831 --> 00:58:57,700
I gotta go.
I'll talk you later.

1241
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:02,938
- "Success is often achieved

1242
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:05,808
"by those who don't know
that failure is inevitable."

1243
00:59:05,841 --> 00:59:07,943
Coco Chanel.

1244
00:59:07,977 --> 00:59:09,278
- Thank you.

1245
00:59:09,311 --> 00:59:11,914
- No, thank you.

1246
00:59:11,947 --> 00:59:13,582
(Sighing)

1247
00:59:15,684 --> 00:59:18,487
- I called Claudio
right after you called me.

1248
00:59:18,521 --> 00:59:19,989
- Who was bidding
against him?

1249
00:59:20,022 --> 00:59:22,658
- Rufus Winthrop. He's often
hired as a buyer's rep.

1250
00:59:22,691 --> 00:59:25,394
I asked him to come
to up Claudio's bid,

1251
00:59:25,427 --> 00:59:28,297
which I could
so lose my job over.

1252
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:30,332
- Thank you.

1253
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:33,836
Oh, I can't believe
I sold it, Dre, and to him.

1254
00:59:33,869 --> 00:59:36,572
- Please. Regardless of
how much you dislike the man

1255
00:59:36,605 --> 00:59:38,374
and everything
he represents,

1256
00:59:38,407 --> 00:59:40,543
the book is gonna
be well taken care of.

1257
00:59:40,576 --> 00:59:42,711
He's probably gonna build
a shrine around it.

1258
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:45,814
And you got more than you hoped
for and you need it. All right?

1259
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:46,849
- Yeah.

1260
00:59:46,882 --> 00:59:49,718
- Listen, I gotta go if
I'm gonna catch my flight.

1261
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:52,354
- Does that mean you won't
be back for the opening?

1262
00:59:52,388 --> 00:59:54,823
- I fly back that same night.

1263
00:59:54,857 --> 00:59:57,793
Oh, I am just so sorry
I'm not gonna be there

1264
00:59:57,826 --> 00:59:59,328
to tell you how great it was

1265
00:59:59,361 --> 01:00:00,563
and how proud I am of you.

1266
01:00:00,596 --> 01:00:02,998

all your help.

1267
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:05,901

I see it. I'd have to be
blind to miss it.

1277

It's incredible, Soph.

1278
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:40,536
Hey, they've zeroed in
on the shipment.

1279
01:00:40,569 --> 01:00:41,904
I'll keep you posted.

1280
01:00:41,937 --> 01:00:43,872
- Oh! That's great.
Thanks.

1281
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:47,943

(Men talking, indistinct)

1283
01:01:06,495 --> 01:01:07,730
-
So with all
this attention,

1284
01:01:07,763 --> 01:01:09,732
they can now show
their audience

1285
01:01:09,765 --> 01:01:11,934
what their innovative
company stands for.

1286
01:01:11,967 --> 01:01:14,937
Though, hard not to question
if their dead fair-trade worker

1287
01:01:14,970 --> 01:01:17,973
will overshadow any message
they might want you to hear.

1288
01:01:19,942 --> 01:01:22,578
- You know what?
Call it good press or bad,

1289
01:01:22,611 --> 01:01:24,747
the phone's ringing
off the hook.

1290
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:27,883
Almost as many complaints
as congratulations,

1291
01:01:27,916 --> 01:01:30,586
but everyone wants tickets
to tomorrow's opening.

1292
01:01:30,619 --> 01:01:32,087
- Yeah, if there
is an opening.

1293
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:34,957
- Did you ever have a chance
to pick up the gold thread?

1294
01:01:34,990 --> 01:01:37,926
- No, no. I got there too late.
They were closed for vacation.

1295
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:40,062
- I'm sure we had
some of that at some point.

1296
01:01:40,095 --> 01:01:41,630
- You're right, we did.

1297
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:43,732
It must still be at
the warehouse, right?

1298
01:01:43,766 --> 01:01:45,834
- That's great. I'll go
look for it right now.

1299
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:48,103
- I'll go. I think I remember
where it might be.

1300
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:49,438
I need some air anyway.

1301

1303

Yeah, of course.
Just one second.

It's in.
The shipment as arrived.

1307
01:02:13,929 --> 01:02:16,131
Alexa tells me
you're down at warehouse?

1308
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:18,867
Well, the truck is waiting
at the loading dock.

1309
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:20,769
- Oh, that is great news, Adam.

1310
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:22,738
-
Yes, it is.
I'll be right down.

1311
01:02:22,771 --> 01:02:24,973
- I'm here. Just send some
staff to meet me.

1312
01:02:25,007 --> 01:02:26,108
We'll get it unloaded.

1313
01:02:26,141 --> 01:02:27,109
Jerry could use

1314
01:02:27,142 --> 01:02:28,510
your help  at the store.

1315

Hey, we might just
pull this off, right?

1318

-Bye.
- See ya.

She changed the order.

I don't know where she is.

1417
01:11:23,578 --> 01:11:25,580
You were supposed
to keep an eye on her.

1418
01:11:27,082 --> 01:11:29,684
-The much-anticipated
inaugural fashion show

1419
01:11:29,718 --> 01:11:32,654
and flagship store opening
from designer Sophie Fyne,

1420
01:11:32,687 --> 01:11:35,156
was not so fine
as the events were marred

1421
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:38,426
by the possible abduction
of her teenaged daughter,

1422
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:39,794
who modelled
in tonight's show.

1423
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:43,231
Before the store could be
locked down for investigation,

1424
01:11:43,265 --> 01:11:45,700
cashes were already
opened for business

1425
01:11:45,734 --> 01:11:48,036
with purchases made
by some very excite--

1426
01:11:54,175 --> 01:11:56,044
- Have a seat.

1427
01:12:03,551 --> 01:12:06,321
- There still
has been no contact

1428
01:12:06,354 --> 01:12:08,590
with any demands
for your daughter.

1429
01:12:13,261 --> 01:12:16,197
Why don't we backtrack?

1430
01:12:16,231 --> 01:12:17,699
Body in a shipping container,

1431
01:12:17,732 --> 01:12:19,434
possible hit and run,

1432
01:12:19,467 --> 01:12:21,469
the accident at the store.

1433
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:24,039
I don't think
we can call this

1434
01:12:24,072 --> 01:12:26,007
a string of
bad luck anymore.

1435
01:12:27,175 --> 01:12:30,211
- Look there has to be
a common thread here

1436
01:12:30,245 --> 01:12:34,115
that links these events
to each other and to someone.

1437
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:38,320
- Mr. Fyne, if there's
any pertinent information

1438
01:12:38,353 --> 01:12:41,156
we might need to know
to help us find your daughter,

1439
01:12:41,189 --> 01:12:44,025
now would be
a very good time to tell us.

1440
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:48,363
- No. There's, uh,
there's nothing I can think of.

1441
01:12:48,396 --> 01:12:52,167
- The 3rd partner in
your company, Mr. Ian Jameson.

1442
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:55,537
Any idea how we might
be able to reach him?

1443
01:12:56,838 --> 01:13:00,542
- Well, we actually haven't
heard from him in over a week.

1444
01:13:00,575 --> 01:13:03,178
- Should we change that
to ex-business partner?

1445
01:13:03,211 --> 01:13:06,514
Or how about ex-business
partner with a score to settle?

1446
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:08,116
- He's still our partner.

1447
01:13:08,149 --> 01:13:11,252
- Any other rogue partners

1448
01:13:11,286 --> 01:13:13,088
we should know about?

1449
01:13:13,121 --> 01:13:15,390
I can only imagine
how you must feel like

1450
01:13:15,423 --> 01:13:19,494
to have a member of your family
put in this... situation.

1451
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:27,769
(Sighing)

1452
01:13:27,802 --> 01:13:31,706
- Look, if she was taken by
someone, it was for a reason.

1453
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:35,510
And that reason is worth more
to them than your daughter.

1454
01:13:35,543 --> 01:13:38,580
We'll be back shortly
to set up.

1455
01:13:39,881 --> 01:13:41,549
- Great.

1456
01:13:53,194 --> 01:13:54,662
(Door closing)

1457
01:14:03,838 --> 01:14:05,573
- The truth, Adam.

1458
01:14:06,408 --> 01:14:07,742
Please.

1459
01:14:11,212 --> 01:14:13,248
- Ian set up a drug deal

1460
01:14:13,281 --> 01:14:16,317
with some very powerful
and dangerous people.

1461
01:14:16,351 --> 01:14:17,419
- Cassadrian.

1462
01:14:17,452 --> 01:14:18,586
- Yeah.

1463
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:21,189
- What kind of drug deal?

1464
01:14:21,222 --> 01:14:22,323
- A $20 million one.

1465
01:14:22,357 --> 01:14:24,225
The $2 million
in our bank account,

1466
01:14:24,259 --> 01:14:25,727
it was an initial payment.

1467
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:27,729
Guess Ian must've
withdrawn it right away.

1468
01:14:27,762 --> 01:14:30,632
The drugs were supposed
to arrive in a shipping crate.

1469
01:14:30,665 --> 01:14:32,600
The one that you found
in the warehouse.

1470
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:35,303
- There was nothing in that
crate except the goods

1471
01:14:35,336 --> 01:14:36,471
for the show and the store.

1472
01:14:36,504 --> 01:14:38,640
- I know, but they
don't know that.

1473
01:14:38,673 --> 01:14:40,909
And now they think
that I have the drugs.

1474
01:14:40,942 --> 01:14:41,910
I don't have 'em.

1475
01:14:41,943 --> 01:14:44,746
I swear to you, Sophie.
I don't have the drugs.

1476
01:14:44,779 --> 01:14:46,548
- Oh, that's why
they took Spencer.

1477
01:14:46,581 --> 01:14:47,882
- Yeah.

1478
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:48,616
(Sighing)

1479
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:50,752
Sophie, what
we're doing here,

1480
01:14:50,785 --> 01:14:53,721
it's a very expensive endeavour.

1481
01:14:53,755 --> 01:14:56,858
All the travel expenses and
the development work and...

1482
01:14:56,891 --> 01:14:59,561
And these places,
they're so corrupt.

1483
01:14:59,594 --> 01:15:02,363
Our finances,
they were in ruin.

1484
01:15:02,397 --> 01:15:04,399
So Ian, he had an idea

1485
01:15:04,432 --> 01:15:06,534
that we could make these
sharp investments

1486
01:15:06,568 --> 01:15:09,604
and we could time the market

1487
01:15:09,637 --> 01:15:11,639
make the money back.

1488
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:14,375
I trusted him.

1489
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:15,810
It didn't work out.

1490
01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:18,646
The losses started
spiralling out of control,

1491
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,216
And then our debt was
just mounting and mounting.

1492
01:15:21,249 --> 01:15:22,250
And Ian was devastated.

1493
01:15:22,283 --> 01:15:24,519
He had the deal with
Cassadrian all worked out

1494
01:15:24,552 --> 01:15:25,854
before I knew
anything about it.

1495
01:15:25,887 --> 01:15:29,357
I guess he thought that was,
like, his one chance

1496
01:15:29,390 --> 01:15:31,526
to replace all
the money he'd lost.

1497
01:15:31,559 --> 01:15:32,861
I don't know.

1498
01:15:32,894 --> 01:15:35,563
But he got greedy
and he demanded more money.

1499
01:15:37,298 --> 01:15:38,666
They were furious...

1500
01:15:39,501 --> 01:15:40,835
and they killed him.

1501
01:15:43,004 --> 01:15:45,406
- How could you have
let it to this point?

1502
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:46,808
How could you
let it get this far?

1503
01:15:46,841 --> 01:15:48,042
- 'Cause Cassadrian said that

1504
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:51,546
if I didn't carry on with the
deal as originally planned,

1505
01:15:51,579 --> 01:15:53,648
it wouldn't be me
that he'd hurt next.

1506
01:15:53,681 --> 01:15:55,583
- We are partners
in business and in life.

1507
01:15:55,617 --> 01:15:57,685
If you'd just come
to me in the beginning,

1508
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:00,522
this would've never gotten
this out of control,

1509
01:16:00,555 --> 01:16:02,357
would never
have gotten this far.

1510
01:16:02,390 --> 01:16:03,892
And Spencer would never be--

1511
01:16:03,925 --> 01:16:04,826
(Cell phone ringing)

1512
01:16:08,596 --> 01:16:10,298
That's it?

1513
01:16:10,331 --> 01:16:11,766
Where's my daughter?

1514
01:16:11,799 --> 01:16:14,836
- Sophie.
- Where is my daughter?

1515
01:16:14,869 --> 01:16:15,837
- Sophie!

1516
01:16:28,883 --> 01:16:31,252
(Sighing)

1517
01:16:48,303 --> 01:16:50,638
(Chuckles)

1518
01:16:52,574 --> 01:16:54,509
(Cell phone ringing)

1519
01:16:54,542 --> 01:16:56,511
- Hello.

1520
01:16:56,544 --> 01:16:58,613
- (Cassadrian):
Abandoned rail yard

1521
01:16:58,646 --> 01:17:00,748
at the corner of
Tonnelle Avenue and 91st

1522
01:17:00,782 --> 01:17:02,016
in Jersey Hangar 2C.

1523
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:03,151
I'll be waiting.

1524
01:17:03,184 --> 01:17:05,553
Come alone or
fashion claims another victim.

1525
01:17:05,587 --> 01:17:06,621
We'll be watching.

1526
01:17:08,056 --> 01:17:09,657
(Cell phone beeps)

1527
01:17:12,493 --> 01:17:14,495
(Talking, indistinct)

1528
01:17:14,529 --> 01:17:16,965
- (Marks):
First, set a trap...

1529
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:18,933
- (Adam): OK.

1530
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:20,301
- They wanna meet.

1531
01:17:21,803 --> 01:17:22,937
- Where?

1532
01:17:24,405 --> 01:17:25,840
- At our warehouse.

1533
01:17:31,746 --> 01:17:33,348
- You shouldn't
be doing this.

1534
01:17:33,381 --> 01:17:36,584
- We tried to convince her
that we could send an agent.

1535
01:17:36,618 --> 01:17:38,786
- She's my child.
I will take care of it.

1536
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:40,922
- Ms. Fyne,
this is for you.

1537
01:17:40,955 --> 01:17:43,691
- It's a GPS, in case
there's a problem.

1538
01:17:48,062 --> 01:17:49,564
We'll be
right behind you.

1539
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:58,940
(Door opening)

1540
01:18:00,942 --> 01:18:02,343
- OK.

1541
01:18:02,377 --> 01:18:04,312
- OK.

1542
01:18:06,047 --> 01:18:07,682
You sure
about this?

1543
01:18:07,715 --> 01:18:10,885
- No. If she was
your daughter?

1544
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:14,022
- You better be
damn careful.

1545
01:18:14,055 --> 01:18:16,324
- You too.
And thank you.

1546
01:18:22,764 --> 01:18:24,565
- OK.

1547
01:18:29,671 --> 01:18:31,539
- She's leaving
the building.

1548
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:48,556
(Sighing)

1549
01:19:35,503 --> 01:19:37,071
- Hello?

1550
01:19:47,782 --> 01:19:49,617
Hello!

1551
01:20:18,212 --> 01:20:20,715
- Mrs. Fyne.

1552
01:20:22,550 --> 01:20:26,721
It is so nice
to finally meet you.

1553
01:20:28,289 --> 01:20:30,792
- I came alone,
like you said.

1554
01:20:30,825 --> 01:20:32,493
Now where's my daughter?

1555
01:20:32,527 --> 01:20:35,096
- Oh, right.
Your daughter. Oh.

1556
01:20:35,129 --> 01:20:37,832
Lovely, little girl you have.

1557
01:20:37,865 --> 01:20:40,568
- I did what you wanted.
Let me see Spencer.

1558
01:20:40,601 --> 01:20:43,271
- No, if you had done
what I wanted,

1559
01:20:43,304 --> 01:20:46,707
all this wouldn't
have been necessary.

1560
01:20:46,741 --> 01:20:48,643
Please, just let me
see my daughter.

1561
01:20:48,676 --> 01:20:50,678
And I will get you
anything you want.

1562
01:20:50,711 --> 01:20:53,214
- Really? Well, as soon
as I get my shipment,

1563
01:20:53,247 --> 01:20:54,448
you get your little girl.

1564
01:20:54,482 --> 01:20:57,218
- What? I don't what you're
talking about. What shipment?

1565
01:20:57,251 --> 01:20:58,219
I don't understand.

1566
01:20:58,252 --> 01:20:59,720
- She doesn't
know anything.

1567
01:20:59,754 --> 01:21:02,557
- Adam, what are you
doing here?

1568
01:21:02,590 --> 01:21:04,892
- Uh, I called him.

1569
01:21:04,926 --> 01:21:08,563
I thought it was about time
that we cleared the air.

1570
01:21:08,596 --> 01:21:11,833
- She shouldn't be here.
It's not about her.

1571
01:21:11,866 --> 01:21:15,136
- No, Adam, you're the one
who got her involved,

1572
01:21:15,169 --> 01:21:16,737
because you're the one

1573
01:21:16,771 --> 01:21:18,873
who backed out of
our little deal, huh?

1574
01:21:18,906 --> 01:21:21,609
- What? What is he talking
about? What deal?

1575
01:21:21,642 --> 01:21:23,611
- Just let her leave.
We'll work this out.

1576
01:21:23,644 --> 01:21:26,280
- No, I'm not going
anywhere without Spencer.

1577
01:21:26,314 --> 01:21:27,281
- Sophie, Please!

1578
01:21:27,315 --> 01:21:28,616
- I don't know what

1579
01:21:28,649 --> 01:21:29,851
Ian has gotten us
into here,

1580
01:21:29,884 --> 01:21:32,019
but I'm not just gonna
stand back

1581
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:33,154
and do nothing.

1582
01:21:33,187 --> 01:21:34,622
- Well, tell her.

1583
01:21:34,655 --> 01:21:36,591
'Cause if you don't, I will.

1584
01:21:36,624 --> 01:21:38,159
- It wasn't Ian.

1585
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:40,862
I lost all our money.

1586
01:21:40,895 --> 01:21:42,930
And the deal
with Cassadrian...

1587
01:21:42,964 --> 01:21:45,166
Well, it wasn't Ian.
It was me.

1588
01:21:45,199 --> 01:21:46,968
I'm sorry.

1589
01:21:47,001 --> 01:21:48,603
(Scoffs)

1590
01:21:48,636 --> 01:21:51,739
It was never suppose to
go this far. I'm sorry.

1591
01:21:52,607 --> 01:21:53,908
- How could you?

1592
01:21:53,941 --> 01:21:56,043
- I was desperate.
All right?

1593
01:21:56,077 --> 01:21:59,647
I heard there was fast money
to be made with Cassadrian

1594
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:01,849
I approached him.
He offered me a deal.

1595
01:22:01,883 --> 01:22:03,651
I took it.
It's that simple.

1596
01:22:03,684 --> 01:22:05,720
- I can't believe this.

1597
01:22:08,356 --> 01:22:10,591
What was the deal, Adam?

1598
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:12,593
- Ah, it doesn't matter now.

1599
01:22:12,627 --> 01:22:13,661
- What was it?

1600
01:22:13,694 --> 01:22:15,296
(Sighing)

1601
01:22:15,329 --> 01:22:17,331
- Heroin,
Mrs. Fyne.

1602
01:22:17,365 --> 01:22:19,700
Heroin.

1603
01:22:21,936 --> 01:22:23,804
- Adam, why?

1604
01:22:23,838 --> 01:22:26,974
- Everything is always
so easy for you, isn't it?

1605
01:22:29,343 --> 01:22:31,612
You're so talented.

1606
01:22:31,646 --> 01:22:33,347
And Ian, whoa!
Well, Ian, you know,

1607
01:22:33,381 --> 01:22:35,349
he's resourceful,
he's innovative.

1608
01:22:35,383 --> 01:22:36,918
He's a real
whiz kid, isn't he?

1609
01:22:36,951 --> 01:22:39,086
And there's me.
I'm the money guy.

1610
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:40,855
But guess what?

1611
01:22:42,323 --> 01:22:44,091
I failed.

1612
01:22:45,993 --> 01:22:47,361
I'm a failure.

1613
01:22:47,395 --> 01:22:49,931
- OK, this is all
very touching.

1614
01:22:49,964 --> 01:22:52,700
Now let's just get to the part
where I get what I want.

1615
01:22:52,733 --> 01:22:54,068
- I wanna see Spencer.

1616
01:22:54,101 --> 01:22:54,735
- You know, enough.

1617
01:22:54,769 --> 01:22:56,804
I am through playing around.

1618
01:22:56,837 --> 01:22:59,073
- You don't understand.

1619
01:22:59,106 --> 01:23:01,642
I need to see Spencer.

1620
01:23:01,676 --> 01:23:03,611
Then I'll show you.

1621
01:23:07,048 --> 01:23:08,115
- Bring her in.

1622
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:09,951
(Whimpers)

1623
01:23:09,984 --> 01:23:11,118
- Mom!

1624
01:23:11,152 --> 01:23:12,253
- Spencer!

1625
01:23:12,286 --> 01:23:13,988
- Dad!

1626
01:23:14,021 --> 01:23:15,723
(Spencer crying)

1627
01:23:15,756 --> 01:23:17,725
- You know what I want.

1628
01:23:18,726 --> 01:23:20,661
I'm not gonna ask again.

1629
01:23:24,031 --> 01:23:26,267
- (Adam): OK.

1630
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:28,169
OK.

1631
01:23:31,138 --> 01:23:32,740
Don't hurt her.

1632
01:23:39,146 --> 01:23:41,148
- Daddy, I'm scared.

1633
01:23:42,183 --> 01:23:43,751
- It's gonna be OK.

1634
01:23:48,055 --> 01:23:49,890
Go see your mother.

1635
01:23:53,394 --> 01:23:54,929
Go.

1636
01:23:54,962 --> 01:23:56,030
(Whimpering)

1637
01:23:56,063 --> 01:23:57,031
(Sighing)

1638
01:23:57,064 --> 01:23:58,899
- Are you all right?

1639
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:08,275
Oh my god!

1640
01:24:08,309 --> 01:24:09,443
- There it is.

1641
01:24:09,477 --> 01:24:11,879
I'll take you to the rest.
Just let them go.

1642
01:24:11,912 --> 01:24:13,047
(Chuckling)

1643
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:15,049
- You son of a--

1644
01:24:15,082 --> 01:24:16,350
(Cassadrian chuckling)

1645
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:18,786
It's been here
the whole time.

1646
01:24:18,819 --> 01:24:20,154
(Crying)

1647
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:24,792
You know, we had
a perfect deal...

1648
01:24:26,027 --> 01:24:29,797
arranged between 2 mutually
respectful business men.

1649
01:24:31,365 --> 01:24:33,467
But you got a
little greedy, huh?

1650
01:24:33,501 --> 01:24:35,936
Causing things
to get a little...

1651
01:24:37,038 --> 01:24:38,706
messy.

1652
01:24:43,077 --> 01:24:45,980
You know that woman
in the crate?

1653
01:24:46,013 --> 01:24:47,248
Well...

1654
01:24:50,151 --> 01:24:51,752
Tell her, Adam.

1655
01:24:53,454 --> 01:24:55,723
I strangled her.

1656
01:24:57,124 --> 01:24:58,492
- And why?

1657
01:24:58,526 --> 01:25:00,961
- Because she saw me
shoot Ian.

1658
01:25:00,995 --> 01:25:02,129
(Exhales)

1659
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:05,032
He was gonna stop me and...

1660
01:25:07,401 --> 01:25:09,470
it was too late.

1661
01:25:11,539 --> 01:25:14,508
- That's enough! That's enough.
I'm calling her right now.

1662
01:25:14,542 --> 01:25:17,344
- Ian, please.
Please, don't make me do this.

1663
01:25:17,378 --> 01:25:20,181
- Let's face it, Adam.
It's over.

1664
01:25:20,214 --> 01:25:21,982
- No.

1665
01:25:24,285 --> 01:25:26,020
(Inhales)

1666
01:25:27,288 --> 01:25:28,322
(Dog barking)

1667
01:25:28,355 --> 01:25:29,924
Aw!

1668
01:25:29,957 --> 01:25:31,125
(Goat bleating)

1669
01:25:31,158 --> 01:25:32,259
(Bucket clattering)

1670
01:25:32,293 --> 01:25:33,994
(Dogs clattering)

1671
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:45,072
- Well, and then
we shipped her to you.

1672
01:25:45,106 --> 01:25:49,110
That was just to remind you
who you were dealing with.

1673
01:25:49,143 --> 01:25:51,579
But you kept putting everyone
around you at risk,

1674
01:25:51,612 --> 01:25:53,380
people you supposedly
care about.

1675
01:25:53,414 --> 01:25:55,216
Then that
$2 million deposit,

1676
01:25:55,249 --> 01:25:58,319
that was just to let you know
that we can give,

1677
01:25:58,352 --> 01:26:00,554
then so quickly
taketh away.

1678
01:26:00,588 --> 01:26:02,556
Because when you play
double or nothing,

1679
01:26:02,590 --> 01:26:04,358
odds are you will
end up with...

1680
01:26:04,391 --> 01:26:06,160
(Sighing)

1681
01:26:06,193 --> 01:26:07,495
...nothing.

1682
01:26:07,528 --> 01:26:09,563
- Are you done?

1683
01:26:13,334 --> 01:26:16,403
- Now, let's go to the store.

1684
01:26:16,437 --> 01:26:19,440
We've got some
shopping to do.

1685
01:26:21,208 --> 01:26:22,209
Oh!

1686
01:26:23,210 --> 01:26:24,178
I almost forgot.

1687
01:26:24,211 --> 01:26:25,346
(Sighing)

1688
01:26:25,379 --> 01:26:28,015
Can't leave any loose
threads now, can we?

1689
01:26:28,048 --> 01:26:30,151
- No!

1690
01:26:30,184 --> 01:26:31,385
(Women screaming)

1691
01:26:31,418 --> 01:26:34,321
- Freeze! Don't move!
Federal agents!

1692
01:26:34,355 --> 01:26:36,056
No, no, no.
Stop, stop!

1693
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:37,291
- I got no gun.

1694
01:26:37,324 --> 01:26:39,326
- FBI! Drop your weapon now!

1695
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:41,061
- Clear out!

1696
01:26:41,095 --> 01:26:42,596
Move out!

1697
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:48,903
(Pipe clattering)

1698
01:26:53,107 --> 01:26:53,941
- It's OK.

1699
01:26:53,974 --> 01:26:55,509
(Crying)

1700
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:01,315
- Are you both OK?

1701
01:27:01,348 --> 01:27:03,951
- It depends
what you mean by OK.

1702
01:27:03,984 --> 01:27:06,487
- Ian suspected Adam
and contacted us

1703
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:09,356
a couple days
before he was killed.

1704
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:12,059
We've been following
Adam ever since,

1705
01:27:12,092 --> 01:27:15,329
but we needed him
to lead us to the dealers.

1706
01:27:15,362 --> 01:27:17,531
(Helicopter overhead)

1707
01:27:20,234 --> 01:27:22,102
- Let's go.

1708
01:27:22,136 --> 01:27:24,104
- Excuse me.

1709
01:27:26,273 --> 01:27:28,108
- Yeah, we're on it.

1710
01:27:28,142 --> 01:27:30,010
(Woman on CB, indistinct)

1711
01:27:31,145 --> 01:27:34,014
(Car doors closing)

1712
01:27:34,048 --> 01:27:35,382
- (Man): Yes, sir.

1713
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:37,484
(Man talking, indistinct)

1714
01:27:37,518 --> 01:27:39,887
(Car engine starting)

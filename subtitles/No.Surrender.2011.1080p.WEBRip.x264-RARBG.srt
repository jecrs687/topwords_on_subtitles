"Dear Amelia:

2
00:00:52,951 --> 00:00:55,420
"Reading your column
has assured me I'm not alone.

3
00:00:55,454 --> 00:00:56,555
"It gets me through the day.

00:00:56,588 --> 00:00:59,758
"But at night,
when I try to close my eyes,

"the fear consumes me.

6
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,662
"How do I end this?

7
00:01:03,695 --> 00:01:06,064

"I admire your courage

"Surviving is the start
of your journey.

12
00:01:42,134 --> 00:01:45,537
"Living is the finish line.
Never back down."

My heart goes out to you.

"I know how hard it is, but
you must go to the police.

00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:10,128
"There are support systems
in place to help you.

20
00:02:10,162 --> 00:02:13,565
"Your husband should never
lay a hand on you again."

the police is too dangerous.

00:02:23,475 --> 00:02:24,876

"The answer to your question

"Whatever it takes."

26
00:02:31,483 --> 00:02:32,851
- What are you doing?

27
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,762
I don't believe this.

28
00:02:43,795 --> 00:02:46,098
It doesn't matter
what I do.

29
00:02:46,131 --> 00:02:48,967
You just keep pushing me
and pushing me

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,769
to do things that
I don't wanna do.

31
00:02:50,802 --> 00:02:53,038
- You can't do this.
It's not right.

32
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:54,740
- Don't you
tell me what's right!

33
00:02:54,773 --> 00:02:56,775
- What are you doing?
Threatening me?

34
00:02:56,808 --> 00:02:58,977
- I'm done making threats.

35
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,012
- What's that
supposed to mean?

36
00:03:03,548 --> 00:03:05,717
Put it down, Trevor.

37
00:03:09,187 --> 00:03:12,057
Put it down, Trevor.
Put it down.

38
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,426
- What are you
gonna do about it?

39
00:03:25,971 --> 00:03:28,807
- Sometimes, when we go through
a traumatic experience,

40
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,512
the fears that linger are
undetectable, even to ourselves.

41
00:03:33,545 --> 00:03:35,213
And we need
to take a step back

42
00:03:35,247 --> 00:03:37,616
and remember what
it was like before.

43
00:03:37,649 --> 00:03:39,651
Who we were before.

44
00:03:39,684 --> 00:03:43,922
Before you lost your job,
before the death in the family,

45
00:03:43,955 --> 00:03:46,925
before you caught
him cheating,

46
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,727
before the violence.

47
00:03:49,795 --> 00:03:51,997
I wanna thank
all of you for coming.

48
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,267
It gives me hope knowing
that our shared experiences

49
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,635
can bring strength.

50
00:03:56,668 --> 00:03:58,770
We learn from our past,

51
00:03:58,804 --> 00:04:01,239
we refuse to let it
define our present

52
00:04:01,273 --> 00:04:03,108
and we build
our own future.

53
00:04:03,141 --> 00:04:06,645
Never back down.
Thank you.

54
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,824
- I just wanna
say thank you.

55
00:04:18,857 --> 00:04:21,860
Your column guided
me through the worst.

56
00:04:21,893 --> 00:04:24,296
And you're my touchstone
every morning.

57
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:26,865
- Thank you.
It works both ways.

58
00:04:26,898 --> 00:04:29,000
Your appreciation
gives me my strength.

59
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:31,736
- You should write a book.

60
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,005
- Actually,
I just started a blog.

61
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:35,574
It's called
Never Back Down.

62
00:04:35,607 --> 00:04:36,575
You know, it'd be great

63
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:39,010
to have some more
strong voices on the site.

64
00:04:39,044 --> 00:04:40,045
- Count me in.

65
00:04:40,078 --> 00:04:42,948
- The link's on the bottom.
What's your name?

66
00:04:42,981 --> 00:04:44,249
- Jenny Reardon.

67
00:04:44,282 --> 00:04:45,750
- It's nice to meet you.

68
00:04:45,784 --> 00:04:47,018
- Hi, nice to meet you.

69
00:04:47,052 --> 00:04:50,989
There's just something else
I need to tell you.

70
00:04:51,022 --> 00:04:53,291
Um, I'm Embarrassed.

71
00:04:53,325 --> 00:04:56,127
- Please don't be.
I'm here to listen.

72
00:04:56,161 --> 00:04:59,531
- No. I'm Embarrassed.

73
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:04,302
- My God!

74
00:05:23,154 --> 00:05:24,990
- To the cover girl.

75
00:05:25,023 --> 00:05:26,992
- It's no big deal.

76
00:05:27,025 --> 00:05:29,995
- Yes, it is. This is what
you've been working for.

77
00:05:30,028 --> 00:05:31,930
- What we've
been working for.

78
00:05:31,963 --> 00:05:34,866
- I think we need to
capitalize on the attention.

79
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,302
I know you're busy with
your speaking gigs,

80
00:05:37,335 --> 00:05:39,838
but the blog is
your future. Look.

81
00:05:43,975 --> 00:05:46,211
Here is a list
of email addresses

82
00:05:46,244 --> 00:05:48,079
who have created
a member profile.

83
00:05:48,113 --> 00:05:51,616
And here is a list of people
who have actively posted.

84
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,653
It's 92%. That's unheard of
in this industry.

85
00:05:54,686 --> 00:05:57,756
The problem is nobody else
knows it exists.

86
00:05:58,757 --> 00:05:59,991
- I'm not sure
the newspaper

87
00:06:00,025 --> 00:06:02,360
would want me to drive
people away from my column.

88
00:06:02,394 --> 00:06:03,795
- Well, screw
the
Sentinel.

89
00:06:03,828 --> 00:06:05,697
Nobody wants to
get ink on their hands.

90
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,233
I can get you primo placement
on the search engines.

91
00:06:08,266 --> 00:06:09,701
- For a shoestring budget?

92
00:06:09,734 --> 00:06:10,936
- Don't get me wrong.

93
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:13,004
If you gave me $2 million,
I could spend it.

94
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:16,074
I could spend it better than any
other search-engine optimizer,

95
00:06:16,107 --> 00:06:18,810
and I'd still get you better
placement on a Web search.

96
00:06:18,843 --> 00:06:22,113
A few structural tweaks
on your site,

97
00:06:22,147 --> 00:06:24,115
maximize keyword density...

98
00:06:26,284 --> 00:06:30,722
OK, bottom line is, if anybody
needs help or advice,

99
00:06:30,755 --> 00:06:34,392
the first site they will
see is
Never Back Down.

100
00:06:34,426 --> 00:06:36,995
All you have to do
is give me the go-ahead.

101
00:06:37,028 --> 00:06:39,664
What do you have to lose?

102
00:06:43,034 --> 00:06:44,669
- All right, let's do it.

103
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:46,771
- Yes!

104
00:06:51,042 --> 00:06:53,011
- It is pretty cool.

105
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:05,290
- I'm up for that.

106
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:09,427
- Thank you.

107
00:07:10,428 --> 00:07:12,864
- Thanks.

108
00:07:12,897 --> 00:07:14,299
- To you.

109
00:07:23,174 --> 00:07:26,711
- Hottie at 9:00
is checking you out.

110
00:07:26,745 --> 00:07:28,713
- I doubt it.

111
00:07:34,886 --> 00:07:35,854
My God!

112
00:07:35,887 --> 00:07:36,855
- I told you.

113
00:07:36,888 --> 00:07:38,456
- You made me look there.

114
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,926
- Well, who says that you
should meet new people

115
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,396
and not shut yourself off
from relationships?

116
00:07:44,429 --> 00:07:46,064
That's right. You.

117
00:07:46,097 --> 00:07:47,165
- OK.

118
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,202
- Meeting guys in a bar,
it's never a good idea.

119
00:07:51,236 --> 00:07:53,038
- And you met Darryl
at a bookstore

120
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:54,906
in the home-and-
garden section.

121
00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:56,207
- Good point.

122
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:58,810
- I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to say that.

123
00:07:58,843 --> 00:08:00,945
I shouldn't
have said that.

124
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:03,815
- Darryl? Forget it.

125
00:08:03,848 --> 00:08:06,317
He's locked up
for 2 more years.

126
00:08:08,486 --> 00:08:11,122
- Ooh, he's coming over.

127
00:08:11,156 --> 00:08:13,925
You'd better
get ready, girl.

128
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,093
- My gosh!

129
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:22,934
- I'm sorry
to bother you,

130
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:26,104
but I noticed you
looking my way and laughing.

131
00:08:28,273 --> 00:08:30,375
I couldn't help but
find out what's so funny.

132
00:08:30,408 --> 00:08:33,978
- I don't remember
talking about him, do you?

133
00:08:34,012 --> 00:08:36,481
- We were talking
about gardening.

134
00:08:36,514 --> 00:08:40,051
- I know what you said.
I can read lips.

135
00:08:40,085 --> 00:08:41,820
- You're bluffing.

136
00:08:41,853 --> 00:08:43,288
- Your name is Amelia.

137
00:08:51,296 --> 00:08:52,864
That's a pretty
good trick.

138
00:08:52,897 --> 00:08:56,000
- I've got another one.
All I need is your phone number.

139
00:08:56,034 --> 00:08:58,403
- Nice try,
but I'm not in the habit

140
00:08:58,436 --> 00:09:00,238
of giving
my phone number out

141
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:02,874
to a guy I've just met
for the first time.

142
00:09:02,907 --> 00:09:05,810
- Do you know what every great
love story has in common?

143
00:09:05,844 --> 00:09:07,479
- No, what?

144
00:09:07,512 --> 00:09:10,815
- At one point, they also
met for the first time.

145
00:09:41,212 --> 00:09:42,847
- Thank you for coming.

146
00:09:42,881 --> 00:09:44,849
I look forward to hearing

147
00:09:44,883 --> 00:09:47,051
from each and every one
of you online.

148
00:09:47,085 --> 00:09:48,353
It gives me hope knowing

149
00:09:48,386 --> 00:09:51,222
that our shared experiences
can bring strength.

150
00:09:52,223 --> 00:09:54,459
We learn from our past,

151
00:09:54,492 --> 00:09:56,861
we refuse to let it
define our present

152
00:09:56,895 --> 00:09:58,596
and we build
our own future.

153
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:01,032
And as always,
never back down.

154
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:03,301
Thank you.

155
00:10:07,305 --> 00:10:09,040
Bravo!

156
00:10:10,108 --> 00:10:12,076
Thank you.

157
00:10:18,049 --> 00:10:19,484
- Thank you for coming.

158
00:10:23,621 --> 00:10:25,123
Thank you.

159
00:10:30,395 --> 00:10:32,197
Thank you. Hi!

160
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,198
- Hi.

161
00:10:33,231 --> 00:10:34,632
- Were you here
the whole time?

162
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:38,269
- And loved every minute
of it. Even the Q & A.

163
00:10:38,303 --> 00:10:40,605
They didn't wanna
let you leave.

164
00:10:40,638 --> 00:10:43,408
- I hope you weren't
charging me by the hour.

165
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:44,909
- Of course not, kiddo.

166
00:10:44,943 --> 00:10:47,612
I take my 5% off the top.

167
00:10:47,645 --> 00:10:51,950
Speaking of which, I have
something big in the works.

168
00:10:51,983 --> 00:10:55,920
- In the works?
As in Modern Media Works?

169
00:10:55,954 --> 00:10:57,922
- Now, don't
jinx it for us.

170
00:10:57,956 --> 00:10:59,290
Just let me
do my thing.

171
00:10:59,324 --> 00:11:01,059
But when the time
is right,

172
00:11:01,092 --> 00:11:04,462
I'll need you to win over
a tougher crowd.

173
00:11:04,495 --> 00:11:07,198
I have to go, but I'll call
you in the morning, OK?

174
00:11:07,232 --> 00:11:08,533
- OK, thank you.

175
00:11:08,566 --> 00:11:10,134
- Bye.

176
00:11:10,168 --> 00:11:11,603
- Bye.

177
00:11:42,433 --> 00:11:44,002
- Party on
the 15th floor.

178
00:11:44,035 --> 00:11:46,070
They've been
holding it up all day.

179
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,307
We met a while ago
at the bar.

180
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,675
- I remember.

181
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:53,144
- I've been back there
a couple of times

182
00:11:53,177 --> 00:11:54,445
hoping to see you again.

183
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:57,315
- I don't have much of
a social life these days.

184
00:11:57,348 --> 00:11:59,183
- I know.
You work too hard.

185
00:11:59,217 --> 00:12:02,487
I found your site.
It posts your event schedule.

186
00:12:05,657 --> 00:12:10,061
- Look, I'm not into
these kinds of games.

187
00:12:10,094 --> 00:12:13,464
- I wanted to see you again,
so here I am. No games.

188
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:17,735
Listen, probably
not the best idea

189
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:19,304
showing up here
unannounced,

190
00:12:19,337 --> 00:12:21,606
but that still doesn't
take away from the fact

191
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:23,274
that I'd like
to take you out.

192
00:12:27,111 --> 00:12:29,380
In case you lost
the first one.

193
00:12:33,084 --> 00:12:34,552
Call me.

194
00:12:40,825 --> 00:12:43,027
- My gosh!
Where have you been?

195
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:45,296
I've been looking
all over for you.

196
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,465
- I've just been working
the room. Where else?

197
00:12:47,498 --> 00:12:50,034
More importantly, who was
that you were talking to?

198
00:12:50,068 --> 00:12:52,704
- Remember Romeo
from the bar?

199
00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:55,606
- Get out of town!
What happened?

200
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,508
- He wants me
to call him.

201
00:12:57,542 --> 00:12:59,310
- So call him.
Set a date.

202
00:12:59,344 --> 00:13:00,611
Go out.
Take charge!

203
00:13:00,645 --> 00:13:02,747
Come on, isn't that
your motto?

204
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:06,317
- No, dating is the last thing
on my mind right know.

205
00:13:40,818 --> 00:13:44,756
- OK, so you're gonna check in
with me 3 times a day by phone:

206
00:13:44,789 --> 00:13:46,557
9:00 a.m, 3:00 p.m.
and 9:00 p.m.

207
00:13:46,591 --> 00:13:48,626
My number is at the
bottom of the page.

208
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:50,628
When you check in with me
at nighttime,

209
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:53,264
that means you're in for
the night, no exceptions.

210
00:13:53,297 --> 00:13:54,399
You got that?

211
00:13:54,432 --> 00:13:56,434
You're gonna start
to look for a job.

212
00:13:56,467 --> 00:13:58,636
If you need assistance
in finding a job,

213
00:13:58,669 --> 00:14:00,338
we have
a placement program.

214
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:01,839
That's what
we're there for.

215
00:14:01,873 --> 00:14:04,809
Just basically make sure
you stay out of trouble

216
00:14:04,842 --> 00:14:07,178
and keep your nose clean
at all times.

217
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:09,847
You understand exactly what
I'm telling you, Mr. Devine?

218
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:11,449
Is it clear?

219
00:14:11,482 --> 00:14:13,484
- Perfectly.

220
00:14:15,353 --> 00:14:17,155
- There you go.

221
00:15:36,734 --> 00:15:38,402
- Ciao, this is Carlo Rossi.

222
00:15:38,436 --> 00:15:40,771
Please leave me
a message after the tone.

223
00:15:40,805 --> 00:15:44,842
- Hi, this is Amelia from
the bar and the conference.

224
00:15:44,876 --> 00:15:47,678
Um, how about dinner
tomorrow night?

225
00:15:47,712 --> 00:15:50,882
- I know a little place
in Beacon Hill. -00?

226
00:15:50,915 --> 00:15:53,551
Let me know
if that works for you.

227
00:15:53,584 --> 00:15:58,589
My number is 202 555-0152.

228
00:16:15,473 --> 00:16:17,208
- Detective Wilson.

229
00:16:21,746 --> 00:16:23,548
- You keep telling me
to call you Hank

230
00:16:23,581 --> 00:16:25,716
and then you call yourself
Detective Wilson.

231
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,718
- Hey, I never know
who's behind the door.

232
00:16:28,886 --> 00:16:30,988
- This is
a pleasant surprise.

233
00:16:31,022 --> 00:16:31,989
How's the family?

234
00:16:32,023 --> 00:16:33,391
- They're great.

235
00:16:33,424 --> 00:16:34,992
Our youngest one
is off to college

236
00:16:35,026 --> 00:16:36,227
at the end of summer.

237
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,363
I'm hoping to spend a couple of
weeks with him up at the lake,

238
00:16:39,397 --> 00:16:40,965
but you know,
with all the work...

239
00:16:40,998 --> 00:16:43,434
- Still putting in
14-hour days?

240
00:16:44,602 --> 00:16:46,804
- Please give
my regards to Cindy.

241
00:16:46,837 --> 00:16:48,372
- Will do.

242
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,842
- What's the matter, Hank?

243
00:16:52,877 --> 00:16:55,513
- I wish I had
better news for you, Amelia.

244
00:16:56,514 --> 00:16:57,915
Darryl's been released.

245
00:16:57,949 --> 00:16:59,584
- When?

246
00:16:59,617 --> 00:17:00,885
- Last Thursday.

247
00:17:00,918 --> 00:17:03,588
Paperwork just
got on my desk today.

248
00:17:03,621 --> 00:17:05,256
I came straight over.

249
00:17:16,367 --> 00:17:20,037
- I know this isn't your fault,
but how is this possible?

250
00:17:20,071 --> 00:17:21,772
- State's broke.

251
00:17:21,806 --> 00:17:24,609
I've been in domestic abuse
for over 20 years,

252
00:17:24,642 --> 00:17:26,944
and this is the worst
I've ever seen it.

253
00:17:28,045 --> 00:17:30,314
All the cutbacks,
overcrowding.

254
00:17:30,348 --> 00:17:32,550
And for some reason,
domestic-abuse offenders

255
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:35,553
are the first ones to receive
a get-out-of-jail-free card.

256
00:17:35,586 --> 00:17:38,489
- Great, so how am I
supposed to feel safe?

257
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,530
- Look, I made sure the
restraining order was in effect.

258
00:17:46,564 --> 00:17:48,032
- What?

259
00:17:48,065 --> 00:17:50,801
- One slip-up on his part
and he's right back in prison.

260
00:17:50,835 --> 00:17:52,837
- That's if you
can catch him.

261
00:17:54,005 --> 00:17:57,541
You can't protect
me 24/7, Hank.

262
00:17:57,575 --> 00:18:00,478
- I'm gonna be checking in with
his parole officer every day.

263
00:18:01,846 --> 00:18:05,316
Amelia. Amelia!

264
00:18:06,384 --> 00:18:08,986
He's not gonna
hurt you again.

265
00:18:18,996 --> 00:18:21,132
- I have a confession.

266
00:18:21,165 --> 00:18:24,735
I read your blog.
It's fascinating.

267
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:27,004
So raw and emotional.

268
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:30,975
- I don't edit my words.
I write what I feel.

269
00:18:31,976 --> 00:18:33,878
And lately, I've been...

270
00:18:33,911 --> 00:18:37,548
- Venting. Sorry,
I didn't mean to...

271
00:18:37,581 --> 00:18:40,951
- No, I'm the one
who should apologize.

272
00:18:40,985 --> 00:18:45,990
It's been a long week, and I'm
not very good company right now.

273
00:18:47,024 --> 00:18:48,826
- You could talk to me.

274
00:18:52,096 --> 00:18:55,866
- My ex-husband Darryl was
just released from prison.

275
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,602
Listen, I know that
I invited you, but....

276
00:18:58,636 --> 00:19:00,905
- No, no, please.
I understand.

277
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,008
No, let me.

278
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,609
- I insist.

279
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:15,619
- You must promise
me 2 things.

280
00:19:15,653 --> 00:19:18,622
Next time, I pay.

281
00:19:18,656 --> 00:19:21,792
And even though
we both have our cars,

282
00:19:21,826 --> 00:19:24,061
you'll let me
see you home.

283
00:19:25,463 --> 00:19:27,631
- I'd appreciate that.

284
00:22:13,163 --> 00:22:18,135
"False starts. One must take
all the time one needs.

285
00:22:18,168 --> 00:22:22,006
"Healing works on its own
schedule, not yours.

286
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:23,807
"False starts and setbacks

287
00:22:23,841 --> 00:22:26,911
"are part of the
long hard road to recovery."

288
00:22:46,797 --> 00:22:47,998
- Miss Davis,
Miss Frankel,

289
00:22:48,032 --> 00:22:49,833
a pleasure to
finally meet you both.

290
00:22:49,867 --> 00:22:50,868
Colin Grosslight.
- Hi.

291
00:22:50,901 --> 00:22:53,938
- Please follow me.
The team is eager to meet you.

292
00:22:56,373 --> 00:22:58,375
In this business,
there's a small window

293
00:22:58,409 --> 00:22:59,910
to turn a spark
into a flame.

294
00:22:59,944 --> 00:23:01,712
Your audience is small
but growing.

295
00:23:01,745 --> 00:23:04,248
And if you want this to become
more than a niche blog,

296
00:23:04,281 --> 00:23:06,850
you're gonna need our help.

297
00:23:06,884 --> 00:23:09,787
- A niche blog?

298
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,057
Marginalizing Amelia's
audience is condescending

299
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:16,193
and frankly not the best way
to start off a new partnership.

300
00:23:16,226 --> 00:23:17,361
- That is not our intent.

301
00:23:17,394 --> 00:23:18,963
We know the numbers
are strong

302
00:23:18,996 --> 00:23:20,197
given the circumstances.

303
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,398
And we love the demo.

304
00:23:21,432 --> 00:23:23,867
We wouldn't be
sitting here otherwise.

305
00:23:23,901 --> 00:23:26,136
And the women who read
your blog trust you,

306
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,404
and that is
invaluable to us.

307
00:23:27,438 --> 00:23:29,239
- And to your advertisers.

308
00:23:29,273 --> 00:23:31,875
- We already have
the majors ready to commit.

309
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:32,943
Just say the word.

310
00:23:32,977 --> 00:23:35,145
- Slow down.
What about content?

311
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:37,381
- We don't care
what you write

312
00:23:37,414 --> 00:23:38,882
as long as people
are reading.

313
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:40,417
- And clicking
every now and then.

314
00:23:45,923 --> 00:23:47,758
- Jody, right?

315
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:49,259
- Right.

316
00:23:49,293 --> 00:23:52,296
- I'm guessing you haven't
been vocal in the meeting

317
00:23:52,329 --> 00:23:54,732
because you didn't
work on these mock-ups.

318
00:23:57,935 --> 00:24:01,972
- I reviewed them, but no,
I didn't work on them.

319
00:24:05,042 --> 00:24:08,312
- So she's here because you
think another woman in the room

320
00:24:08,345 --> 00:24:10,314
will make me feel
more comfortable?

321
00:24:10,347 --> 00:24:12,816
- I know
all about your blog.

322
00:24:14,351 --> 00:24:18,789
- You have a small window to
impress a prospective client.

323
00:24:18,822 --> 00:24:20,724
That window
is about to close.

324
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:24,795
What do you think
of the presentation?

325
00:24:26,497 --> 00:24:29,400
- There's a visual flair
that's familiar,

326
00:24:29,433 --> 00:24:32,136
but it's--it's
missing your imprint.

327
00:24:33,437 --> 00:24:36,740
- I think it's
a Carrie Bradshaw rip-off.

328
00:24:38,909 --> 00:24:41,078
I'll be back next week
to hear your pitch.

329
00:24:45,983 --> 00:24:49,820
And by the way,
it's one butterfly.

330
00:26:55,412 --> 00:26:58,081
- Well, there's no sign
of forced entry.

331
00:26:58,115 --> 00:27:01,218
We'll ask the neighbours
if anyone saw something,

332
00:27:01,251 --> 00:27:03,187
but so far,
we've got nothing.

333
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,589
Have you received any
threatening messages lately?

334
00:27:05,622 --> 00:27:06,957
Maybe on your computer?

335
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:09,626
- This is obviously Darryl.

336
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,062
- Well, Darryl is
the most likely suspect.

337
00:27:12,095 --> 00:27:14,965
If it is him, we know that
he'll slip up eventually.

338
00:27:14,998 --> 00:27:18,535
But the problem is that you've
become a public figure, Amelia.

339
00:27:18,569 --> 00:27:20,604
And we can't ignore
the possibility

340
00:27:20,637 --> 00:27:23,073
that this attack might
be connected to the blog.

341
00:27:24,107 --> 00:27:26,109
- I highly doubt that.

342
00:27:26,143 --> 00:27:28,545
- Well, obsessed fans,
angry husbands.

343
00:27:28,579 --> 00:27:30,080
I just wanna make sure

344
00:27:30,113 --> 00:27:32,983
that we look into
all the possibilities here.

345
00:27:33,016 --> 00:27:34,585
- So you're
basically telling me

346
00:27:34,618 --> 00:27:37,020
that I have to
be afraid of everybody?

347
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:42,392
- Is your address
listed anywhere?

348
00:27:42,426 --> 00:27:44,361
- No, I don't
ever give it out.

349
00:27:44,394 --> 00:27:48,198
- What about neighbours? Have
you had any disputes recently?

350
00:27:48,232 --> 00:27:50,534
- I pretty much
keep to myself.

351
00:27:52,703 --> 00:27:55,138
- Is there anyone new
in your life?

352
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:09,086
- We went on one date.

353
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:11,688
He seems like
a really nice guy.

354
00:28:11,722 --> 00:28:15,125
I just... I can't imagine that
he would do something like this.

355
00:28:15,158 --> 00:28:17,160
- Well, it won't hurt
to check him out.

356
00:28:17,194 --> 00:28:19,563
And if you don't mind,
I'm gonna have the tech guys

357
00:28:19,596 --> 00:28:22,099
from the station
look into your Web site.

358
00:28:22,132 --> 00:28:23,934
See if that
leads to anything.

359
00:28:24,735 --> 00:28:27,537
Hey, we're gonna
catch this guy.

360
00:28:34,578 --> 00:28:38,115
- You know I'm not gonna answer
a thing without my lawyer.

361
00:28:39,383 --> 00:28:43,186
- Yeah well, the problem with
lawyers is they cost money.

362
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,689
And, um, by the look
of this place,

363
00:28:45,722 --> 00:28:48,959
you'd be best off
talking to me yourself.

364
00:28:52,462 --> 00:28:55,365
- You look old, Detective.

365
00:28:56,366 --> 00:28:57,601
- I'd look even older

366
00:28:57,634 --> 00:29:00,404
if you'd spent the whole
5 years in prison.

367
00:29:01,471 --> 00:29:03,407
- I'm not saying
I was a choir boy,

368
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,342
but I didn't deserve
all that time.

369
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:08,011
And losing Amelia
was enough of a punishment.

370
00:29:11,081 --> 00:29:12,049
- Losing Amelia?

371
00:29:12,082 --> 00:29:13,050
- Yeah.

372
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:14,685
- And when
exactly was that?

373
00:29:14,718 --> 00:29:16,286
Was that before or after

374
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,221
you threw her down
a flight of stairs?

375
00:29:18,255 --> 00:29:20,724
Or maybe it's the time
you put her in the hospital

376
00:29:20,757 --> 00:29:21,658
with your fists.

377
00:29:21,692 --> 00:29:24,161
It's too bad I don't
hand out the sentences.

378
00:29:26,263 --> 00:29:30,400
- Tough guy with your badge
and your piece.

379
00:29:31,702 --> 00:29:33,570
Truth is you couldn't
protect her then.

380
00:29:33,603 --> 00:29:36,306
And from the looks of things,
you can't protect her now.

381
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,775
- I'm watching you, Devine.

382
00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:42,112
I'm watching
every move you make.

383
00:29:42,145 --> 00:29:44,014
- Are we done here?

384
00:30:13,176 --> 00:30:14,711
- Thanks for having me.

385
00:30:15,846 --> 00:30:18,782
I just couldn't stay there
until the alarm was in.

386
00:30:18,815 --> 00:30:21,451
- Don't mention it.
I could use the company.

387
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:24,554
This'll make it
more comfortable.

388
00:30:24,588 --> 00:30:26,757
- Thanks.

389
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,528
- How about some tea?

390
00:30:31,561 --> 00:30:34,364
- Yeah, that'd be
great. Thank you.

391
00:30:38,335 --> 00:30:40,804
Do you think
it was Darryl?

392
00:30:40,837 --> 00:30:43,340
- I don't know
who else it could be.

393
00:30:48,211 --> 00:30:50,747
After he hit me
the first time...

394
00:30:52,516 --> 00:30:54,618
I knew when
it was coming.

395
00:30:55,619 --> 00:30:57,487
When he was drinking...

396
00:30:58,488 --> 00:31:00,424
or when we'd argue.

397
00:31:02,659 --> 00:31:04,828
But this is different.

398
00:31:06,563 --> 00:31:11,101
Not knowing when or
where it might happen again.

399
00:31:12,369 --> 00:31:16,440
But it's like that feeling
in the pit of my stomach

400
00:31:16,473 --> 00:31:17,441
is the same.

401
00:31:17,474 --> 00:31:19,476
Does that
make any sense?

402
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,878
- Yeah.

403
00:31:21,912 --> 00:31:23,880
- And what
bothers me most

404
00:31:23,914 --> 00:31:27,217
is how everything I feel
I've worked so hard for

405
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,885
can be taken away
like that.

406
00:31:31,188 --> 00:31:33,356
- No one can take away
what you've achieved

407
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:34,724
or the progress
you've made.

408
00:31:38,929 --> 00:31:42,799
- How did you do it?
How did you fight back?

409
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:45,235
- It was a long road.

410
00:31:45,268 --> 00:31:49,673
Martial arts taught me
some self-confidence, but...

411
00:31:50,874 --> 00:31:53,510
it wasn't until
I started writing you

412
00:31:53,543 --> 00:31:58,215
that I realized there's a
possibility of a better life.

413
00:32:02,652 --> 00:32:05,155
One day, I just snapped.

414
00:32:06,256 --> 00:32:09,426
It didn't feel real
until I saw the blood.

415
00:32:10,427 --> 00:32:11,895
That changed everything.

416
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:15,599
- I'm not sure
I can do it.

417
00:32:15,632 --> 00:32:17,234
- You fought back.

418
00:32:17,267 --> 00:32:19,970
You did it once and
you can do it again.

419
00:32:20,003 --> 00:32:23,540
We don't even know who
it is that's doing this.

420
00:32:23,573 --> 00:32:26,643
But whoever it is, you're strong
enough to do whatever it takes.

421
00:32:26,676 --> 00:32:28,612
- I'm just not sure

422
00:32:28,645 --> 00:32:32,249
that I have that kind
of courage anymore.

423
00:32:32,282 --> 00:32:34,184
- Neither was I.

424
00:32:35,318 --> 00:32:39,289
But you were there for me.
And now I'm there for you.

425
00:32:40,657 --> 00:32:43,760
- Thanks. I needed that.

426
00:32:53,603 --> 00:32:55,205
- Thanks.

427
00:32:56,006 --> 00:32:58,441
Mr. Rossi.
- Yes?

428
00:32:58,475 --> 00:33:01,278
- I have a few questions for
you. This shouldn't take long.

429
00:33:01,311 --> 00:33:03,980
- Is this about my work visa?
I renewed it through the mail.

430
00:33:04,014 --> 00:33:05,715
- No.

431
00:33:05,749 --> 00:33:08,318
- Well then, what can I
help you with, Officer?

432
00:33:08,351 --> 00:33:09,586
- Actually, it's Detective.

433
00:33:11,021 --> 00:33:13,456
- Please come in.

434
00:33:22,966 --> 00:33:24,935
- I need to know
your whereabouts

435
00:33:24,968 --> 00:33:26,670
this past Wednesday evening.

436
00:33:26,703 --> 00:33:28,438
- Why?

437
00:33:28,471 --> 00:33:31,241
- I'll ask the questions,
Mr. Rossi.

438
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,015
- Wednesday.

439
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:41,551
I was at Dusty's Bar.

440
00:33:41,585 --> 00:33:43,353
I was meeting
someone at 5:00.

441
00:33:43,386 --> 00:33:45,956
It lasted about an hour.
I stayed after he left.

442
00:33:45,989 --> 00:33:48,491
- You stayed until what time?

443
00:33:48,525 --> 00:33:50,026
Not sure. 10:00 maybe.

444
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:53,730
- Maybe's are no good for me.
I need you to be sure.

445
00:33:54,764 --> 00:33:56,833
Yes, 10:00.

446
00:33:57,867 --> 00:34:00,036
- And who were you with?

447
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:02,572
- The meeting was with
some potential clients.

448
00:34:02,606 --> 00:34:04,808
I stayed afterwards
for a burger and a beer.

449
00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:07,510
- You stayed by yourself?

450
00:34:07,544 --> 00:34:10,480
- I ate at the bar.
I'm a regular there.

451
00:34:10,513 --> 00:34:12,983
- Can anyone corroborate
your story?

452
00:34:13,016 --> 00:34:14,884
- I'm sure the bartender can.

453
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:16,386
- You got a name for me?

454
00:34:16,419 --> 00:34:19,456
- I can't remember who
was working that night.

455
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:21,057
I think it was Meagan.

456
00:34:22,158 --> 00:34:25,328
- Can you at least tell me
what this is all about?

457
00:34:25,362 --> 00:34:28,598
- Amelia Davis. She was
attacked last Wednesday night.

458
00:34:28,632 --> 00:34:30,533
- My God!
Is she all right?

459
00:34:33,436 --> 00:34:35,538
You think it was me.

460
00:34:35,572 --> 00:34:38,908
- Just asking questions,
Mr. Rossi.

461
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:42,512
I'll be in touch.

462
00:34:53,957 --> 00:34:56,559
Meagan, I gotta ask you
a few questions.

463
00:34:56,593 --> 00:34:59,696
Were you working here
last Wednesday night?

464
00:34:59,729 --> 00:35:01,031
- Wednesday's my night off.

465
00:35:01,064 --> 00:35:03,433
The manager saves me
for the weekends.

466
00:35:03,466 --> 00:35:05,468
- So who was working?

467
00:35:05,502 --> 00:35:07,871
- Dave. He's the manager.

468
00:35:09,439 --> 00:35:13,343
- I'm trying to get some
information on this individual.

469
00:35:14,144 --> 00:35:15,645
- Carlo.

470
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:17,080
- How well
do you know him?

471
00:35:17,113 --> 00:35:21,418
- Enough to tell you his name.
What's this about?

472
00:35:21,451 --> 00:35:24,387
- I'm conducting
a criminal investigation.

473
00:35:25,755 --> 00:35:28,591
- He's in here
a couple of times a week.

474
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:30,727
- Does he pay cash,
credit card?

475
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,996
- Credit card.
Every time.

476
00:35:33,029 --> 00:35:36,700
- I'm gonna need to see your
receipts from Wednesday night.

477
00:35:36,733 --> 00:35:40,136
- I only swipe the card.
Dave takes care of the rest.

478
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,771
He's in at 6:00.

479
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:46,609
- Well then, you get Dave
to give me a call, OK?

480
00:35:46,643 --> 00:35:48,445
- Will do.

481
00:35:49,913 --> 00:35:52,982
- We wanna brand Amelia
as the next Oprah...

482
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,986
uniting and inspiring
women of all kinds.

483
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:01,758
Your words will comfort them.
Your message will empower them.

484
00:36:01,791 --> 00:36:04,994
They can read the blog
from the workplace...

485
00:36:08,498 --> 00:36:10,633
keep your book
next to their bed,

486
00:36:10,667 --> 00:36:12,702
listen to your podcast
on their iPod and,

487
00:36:12,736 --> 00:36:14,971
if things progress
as we expect,

488
00:36:15,004 --> 00:36:17,874
they'll soon be
watching your TV show.

489
00:36:20,009 --> 00:36:22,779
Never Back Down
will
be the place women go

490
00:36:22,812 --> 00:36:26,649
when they feel threatened or
feel like they've lost control.

491
00:36:26,683 --> 00:36:30,019
You will help them get back
to who they were.

492
00:36:42,532 --> 00:36:45,502
- Look, I get your personal
interest in this case.

493
00:36:45,535 --> 00:36:47,070
But like I told you
over the phone,

494
00:36:47,103 --> 00:36:49,205
I don't see anything
unusual with...

495
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:51,908
- Devine.
Darryl Devine.

496
00:36:56,513 --> 00:36:58,081
- Devine.
Thank you.

497
00:36:59,182 --> 00:37:03,052
- Look, Amelia Davis was
attacked in her home,

498
00:37:03,086 --> 00:37:04,921
and Devine is
our prime suspect.

499
00:37:04,954 --> 00:37:06,656
You wouldn't be
breaking any rules.

500
00:37:06,689 --> 00:37:09,826
I just want the same information
you have. That's all.

501
00:37:09,859 --> 00:37:12,028
- What day are
you looking at?

502
00:37:12,061 --> 00:37:15,532
- For starters,
Wednesday the 7th.

503
00:37:22,906 --> 00:37:25,575
Don't you put your log-ins
in the computer?

504
00:37:25,608 --> 00:37:26,576
- To tell you the truth,

505
00:37:26,609 --> 00:37:29,045
I'm a little bit behind here
on my data entry.

506
00:37:29,078 --> 00:37:31,714
So just give me
a second and I'll...

507
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,989
Here, what'd you say?
Wednesday the 7th.

508
00:37:42,025 --> 00:37:45,195
- Devine, check-in time:
9:00 p.m. It's all there.

509
00:37:45,228 --> 00:37:47,063
- In person?

510
00:37:47,096 --> 00:37:50,533
- Why in person? Listen, I have
over 150 open cases here.

511
00:37:50,567 --> 00:37:52,602
The only guys who
need to show their face

512
00:37:52,635 --> 00:37:54,070
are murderers
or serial rapists.

513
00:37:54,103 --> 00:37:55,872
Now, unless Devine
fails a drug test

514
00:37:55,905 --> 00:37:58,074
or even gets into
a little bit of trouble,

515
00:37:58,107 --> 00:37:59,742
all he has to do
is phone it in.

516
00:37:59,776 --> 00:38:02,078
That's the way we
do things around here.

517
00:38:02,111 --> 00:38:04,814
- This guy was one punch away
from making that cut, OK?

518
00:38:05,849 --> 00:38:08,785
Now, he knows how to
manipulate the system.

519
00:38:08,818 --> 00:38:12,555
So if he's as much as
2 minutes late in checking in,

520
00:38:12,589 --> 00:38:14,691
I'd like
to get a call, OK?

521
00:38:15,892 --> 00:38:16,893
- OK.

522
00:38:16,926 --> 00:38:17,927
- Thanks.

523
00:38:23,733 --> 00:38:27,770
- I got them up to $450 a year
for 3 years, guaranteed.

524
00:38:27,804 --> 00:38:31,708
Plus the signing bonus--
$1.3 million.

525
00:38:31,741 --> 00:38:33,710
- The money isn't the issue.

526
00:38:33,743 --> 00:38:36,346
- I thought you liked
the presentation.

527
00:38:36,379 --> 00:38:38,047
- I did.

528
00:38:38,081 --> 00:38:40,250
I did.
They have a vision.

529
00:38:40,283 --> 00:38:42,752
It's not exactly
my vision,

530
00:38:42,785 --> 00:38:44,888
but it's bigger and
it could be better.

531
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:46,756
- So then what's
holding you back?

532
00:38:47,824 --> 00:38:51,928
- Book tours,
corporate-speaking engagements.

533
00:38:51,961 --> 00:38:55,331
Me on TV. It's just
a lot to think about.

534
00:38:56,766 --> 00:39:00,169
- Look, I know you're worried
about selling yourself out,

535
00:39:00,203 --> 00:39:03,206
but this is an opportunity
of a lifetime, Amelia.

536
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:04,941
And I don't
mean the money.

537
00:39:04,974 --> 00:39:08,311
You'll have a platform to
reach millions of people

538
00:39:08,344 --> 00:39:10,280
and really
touch their lives.

539
00:39:10,313 --> 00:39:13,850
A bigger audience won't
change who you are.

540
00:39:18,221 --> 00:39:20,623
- I just need
some time to think.

541
00:39:20,657 --> 00:39:22,825
- Sure. But don't
take too long.

542
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:26,162
These companies have a very
short attention span.

543
00:39:26,195 --> 00:39:27,664
- OK.

544
00:39:28,665 --> 00:39:31,034
- Are you OK about
going home alone?

545
00:39:31,067 --> 00:39:34,337
- Yeah, I need to practise
what I preach, right?

546
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:36,239
Go back to the life I know.

547
00:39:38,141 --> 00:39:39,742
Excuse me.

548
00:39:42,712 --> 00:39:43,813
Hello?

549
00:39:43,846 --> 00:39:47,383
- Hey, Amelia. If you have
a moment, can you drop by?

550
00:39:47,417 --> 00:39:48,751
-I'm on my way.

551
00:39:48,785 --> 00:39:49,786
- Thanks.

552
00:39:49,819 --> 00:39:52,355
- Everything OK?

553
00:39:52,388 --> 00:39:54,691
- Yeah, I'll call you later.

554
00:39:58,761 --> 00:40:01,130
- Darryl's been walking
the straight line.

555
00:40:01,164 --> 00:40:04,400
He's been checking in regularly
with his parole officer

556
00:40:04,434 --> 00:40:06,102
and staying out of trouble.

557
00:40:06,135 --> 00:40:09,405
But he still has no alibi
for the night of the attack.

558
00:40:09,439 --> 00:40:10,807
- Can you arrest him?

559
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,376
- No, I need
something concrete.

560
00:40:13,409 --> 00:40:15,812
You know I'd
bring him in if I could.

561
00:40:16,846 --> 00:40:19,349
I also talked
with Carlo Rossi.

562
00:40:19,382 --> 00:40:22,151
He said he was
at Dusty's Bar that night.

563
00:40:22,185 --> 00:40:25,154
Bartender doesn't
remember specifics,

564
00:40:25,188 --> 00:40:28,758
but his card
was run twice:

565
00:40:28,791 --> 00:40:31,961
5:36 p.m.
and 7:04 p.m.

566
00:40:31,995 --> 00:40:35,098
Now, you said the attack
took place at 6:45 p.m.

567
00:40:35,131 --> 00:40:36,366
- Yeah.

568
00:40:36,399 --> 00:40:38,901
- It's 6 miles between
Dusty's Bar and your place,

569
00:40:38,935 --> 00:40:40,370
so I don't think
Carlo's our guy.

570
00:40:40,403 --> 00:40:42,972
- It's Darryl,
I'm telling you.

571
00:40:43,006 --> 00:40:46,275
- Yeah well, if it is, he's
gonna slip up and we'll get him.

572
00:42:01,851 --> 00:42:04,454
- Bernice, make the deal.

573
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:15,932
- I won't waste any time.

574
00:42:15,965 --> 00:42:17,166
It's with great pride

575
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:21,404
we welcome Amelia Davis into
the Modern Media Works family

576
00:42:21,437 --> 00:42:24,140
and letting us
be her megaphone.

577
00:42:33,049 --> 00:42:37,520
- I have to confess. I had
my doubts about selling.

578
00:42:37,553 --> 00:42:40,022
I wasn't even sure
it was mine to sell.

579
00:42:40,056 --> 00:42:44,160
And then I remembered why
I wrote my first column.

580
00:42:44,193 --> 00:42:48,164
Because I was
scared and alone.

581
00:42:48,197 --> 00:42:50,967
Well, I'm not
alone anymore.

582
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,504
I look forward to collaborating
with Modern Media Works

583
00:42:54,537 --> 00:42:57,039
and their talented
marketing team.

584
00:42:57,073 --> 00:43:00,042
And together, I hope
we can reach more women,

585
00:43:00,076 --> 00:43:02,445
making sure that they never
have to feel scared

586
00:43:02,478 --> 00:43:03,479
or alone ever again.

587
00:43:03,513 --> 00:43:05,381
Thank you.

588
00:43:07,083 --> 00:43:08,451
- Very nice.

589
00:43:15,925 --> 00:43:18,161
- I guess you don't
need me anymore.

590
00:43:18,194 --> 00:43:21,130
- Yeah, I--I wanted to
talk to you about that.

591
00:43:21,164 --> 00:43:25,268
The blog needs a writer for a
weekly article on self-defence.

592
00:43:25,301 --> 00:43:27,937
I know you're used to
working for free,

593
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:29,472
but this one's
a paying job.

594
00:43:36,112 --> 00:43:37,413
- Thank you.

595
00:43:37,446 --> 00:43:41,317
- You didn't think I'd
leave you behind, did you?

596
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,241
- I'm worried.

597
00:44:05,274 --> 00:44:06,509
- What are you
doing here?

598
00:44:06,542 --> 00:44:08,611
- The police questioned me
about an attack.

599
00:44:08,644 --> 00:44:10,246
You don't return
my phone calls.

600
00:44:10,279 --> 00:44:11,480
- I've been busy.

601
00:44:11,514 --> 00:44:14,483
- I understand, but I still
deserve to know what's going on.

602
00:44:14,517 --> 00:44:16,652
Do you really think
I could've attacked you?

603
00:44:17,687 --> 00:44:18,955
- I'm sorry.

604
00:44:18,988 --> 00:44:21,991
They asked me who
was new in my life.

605
00:44:22,024 --> 00:44:24,527
I didn't think that you did it,
but I barely know you.

606
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,661
- That's not my fault.

607
00:44:25,695 --> 00:44:28,531
- I'm sorry.
- You're forgiven.

608
00:44:28,564 --> 00:44:31,267
Now, if my memory
serves me right,

609
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,302
you owe me a make-up date.

610
00:44:35,171 --> 00:44:36,439
I said yes
when you asked.

611
00:44:40,109 --> 00:44:41,510
Is that a yes?

612
00:44:42,612 --> 00:44:44,413
- Stop following me.

613
00:44:45,581 --> 00:44:47,550
- You're too fast
for me anyway.

614
00:44:56,459 --> 00:44:58,227
- Coming!

615
00:45:08,771 --> 00:45:10,973
- You look incredible.

616
00:45:11,007 --> 00:45:12,475
- So do you.

617
00:45:12,508 --> 00:45:15,978
- I know you suggested
that place in Beacon Hill,

618
00:45:16,012 --> 00:45:18,114
but I had something
different in mind.

619
00:45:18,147 --> 00:45:20,716
- OK, sounds great.

620
00:45:22,585 --> 00:45:24,587
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

621
00:45:30,226 --> 00:45:32,995
- Where did you learn
so much about produce?

622
00:45:33,029 --> 00:45:35,197
- My mother.
She loved to cook.

623
00:45:35,231 --> 00:45:38,367
And I was an only child,
so she taught me.

624
00:45:41,203 --> 00:45:42,571
Close your eyes.

625
00:45:47,576 --> 00:45:49,345
Now breathe in.

626
00:45:52,782 --> 00:45:54,517
- What do you smell?

627
00:45:55,651 --> 00:45:59,455
- It's peppery,
a little like black licorice.

628
00:46:00,456 --> 00:46:02,058
- Good.

629
00:46:02,091 --> 00:46:03,326
- Now what?

630
00:46:05,361 --> 00:46:07,163
- Now we take it home.

631
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:23,279
- Why did you leave Italy?

632
00:46:23,312 --> 00:46:27,450
- My father remarried.
Our family was broken.

633
00:46:29,118 --> 00:46:32,288
I wanted to start over,
be invisible.

634
00:46:33,289 --> 00:46:36,292
- I can relate to that.

635
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,462
- Why did you stay...

636
00:46:40,496 --> 00:46:42,198
after he went to jail?

637
00:46:45,234 --> 00:46:46,602
I'm sorry.

638
00:46:46,635 --> 00:46:50,172
We don't have to talk about it
if you don't want to.

639
00:46:52,808 --> 00:46:54,810
- No, it's OK.

640
00:46:57,313 --> 00:47:00,449
I thought about
moving back to San Francisco.

641
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:03,119
The ocean.

642
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,354
The fog.

643
00:47:06,355 --> 00:47:08,357
I love it there.

644
00:47:09,525 --> 00:47:12,595
My parents practically
begged me to come back home.

645
00:47:13,863 --> 00:47:16,332
But something just
didn't feel right.

646
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:21,404
Like my experience here
wasn't finished, you know?

647
00:47:34,283 --> 00:47:37,686
Will you come with me to
this benefit Friday night?

648
00:47:39,155 --> 00:47:42,425
I know that I'm the one
who keeps making the plans.

649
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:44,760
I hope you're
comfortable with that.

650
00:47:45,761 --> 00:47:48,197
- I have plans
for us, too.

651
00:47:49,265 --> 00:47:51,634
I'd love for you
to see Italy.

652
00:47:52,635 --> 00:47:56,272
The food,
the architecture.

653
00:47:56,305 --> 00:47:58,207
Shopping.

654
00:48:00,509 --> 00:48:02,812
I would love
to take you there.

655
00:48:05,214 --> 00:48:07,783
- I've heard
the summer is nice.

656
00:48:25,901 --> 00:48:28,671
Does this mean you'll
come Friday night?

Miss Davis!

671
00:51:01,423 --> 00:51:02,758
- Hi.
- Hi.

672
00:51:02,791 --> 00:51:04,326
Not bad?

673
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,194
- Yeah.

674
00:51:05,227 --> 00:51:07,396
- Perfect location
for people watching.

675
00:51:07,429 --> 00:51:08,897
- Thank you.
This one.

676
00:51:10,132 --> 00:51:11,767
Thank you.

677
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,669
- So where's your date?

678
00:51:13,702 --> 00:51:15,537
- He's on his way.

679
00:51:15,571 --> 00:51:17,473
- Good, so you
have time to spill.

680
00:51:19,775 --> 00:51:21,477
- We had a good time.

681
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:24,680
- You blog endlessly about
your most intimate feelings,

682
00:51:24,713 --> 00:51:27,549
and "we had a good time"
is the best you can do?

683
00:51:27,583 --> 00:51:29,084
Come on, I'm living
vicariously

684
00:51:29,118 --> 00:51:31,687
through your love life
right now.

685
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:34,023
- Ask me again after
I've had a few drinks.

686
00:51:34,056 --> 00:51:35,691
That's more like it.

687
00:51:36,959 --> 00:51:38,527
Cheers.!

688
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,497
- I'm so sorry. I can't
believe I just did that.

689
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:44,800
- Don't worry. Just a little
water and it'll come right out.

690
00:51:44,833 --> 00:51:46,468
I'll be right back.

691
00:51:59,882 --> 00:52:00,849
- Wow!

692
00:52:00,883 --> 00:52:03,018
Still a looker.

693
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,488
Nice.

694
00:52:06,522 --> 00:52:09,124
- What's this
all about, Darryl?

695
00:52:09,158 --> 00:52:11,560
- I'm not here
to hurt you.

696
00:52:11,593 --> 00:52:12,961
I just want my cut.

697
00:52:14,029 --> 00:52:17,066
I know you're making
millions from this deal.

698
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:19,134
You know what
I got out of it?

699
00:52:19,168 --> 00:52:21,537
That cop of yours
tracking my every move.

700
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:24,440
Reporters knocking on the door
of my trashy studio hole

701
00:52:24,473 --> 00:52:26,041
to get an exclusive
of the scumbag

702
00:52:26,075 --> 00:52:28,877
who turned you into
a poor wounded puppy.

703
00:52:28,911 --> 00:52:31,080
Calling my work nonstop.

704
00:52:31,113 --> 00:52:34,149
I even got fired.
Did you know that?

705
00:52:34,183 --> 00:52:36,618
- That's not my fault.

706
00:52:36,652 --> 00:52:38,854
I'm not giving
you anything.

707
00:52:40,522 --> 00:52:43,625
- You're gonna listen
to me for once.

708
00:52:43,659 --> 00:52:45,761
I paid my debt to society.

709
00:52:45,794 --> 00:52:47,763
Now it's your turn to pay.

710
00:52:50,599 --> 00:52:53,001
You have no idea
how much I loved you.

711
00:52:54,036 --> 00:52:55,804
- You sure knew
how to show it.

712
00:52:56,805 --> 00:52:58,540
- Never your fault, right?

713
00:53:00,542 --> 00:53:02,444
I hope you reconsider.

714
00:53:34,777 --> 00:53:36,578
- How is it
possible that,

715
00:53:36,612 --> 00:53:39,681
with all of these people here,
nobody saw him?

716
00:53:39,715 --> 00:53:42,918
- We showed his picture to
every single person. No luck.

717
00:53:42,951 --> 00:53:45,154
Hopefully, the
surveillance cameras

718
00:53:45,187 --> 00:53:46,655
caught him
going in and out.

719
00:53:46,688 --> 00:53:48,757
And he'll be where
he belongs: behind bars.

720
00:53:48,791 --> 00:53:50,692
- How long is
that gonna take?

721
00:53:50,726 --> 00:53:52,828
- Once I can put him
at the scene,

722
00:53:52,861 --> 00:53:55,097
he'll be in custody
within the hour.

723
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:58,133
In the meantime, I suggest
you stay somewhere safe.

724
00:54:11,146 --> 00:54:12,981
- Good morning,
bella.

725
00:54:13,015 --> 00:54:14,750
- Good morning.

726
00:54:16,852 --> 00:54:19,154
- How did you
sleep last night?

727
00:54:20,155 --> 00:54:21,590
- Great, thanks.

728
00:54:21,623 --> 00:54:23,992
And thanks for
giving me space.

729
00:54:24,026 --> 00:54:28,030
I haven't had a good night's
sleep since Darryl's been out.

730
00:54:29,765 --> 00:54:30,999
Thank you.

731
00:54:31,033 --> 00:54:32,935
- Have a seat.

732
00:54:41,176 --> 00:54:42,611
Any messages?

733
00:54:42,644 --> 00:54:43,912
- No.

734
00:54:49,084 --> 00:54:51,653
- Whatever you wanna
do today, we do.

735
00:54:51,687 --> 00:54:53,255
- Anywhere
with fresh air.

736
00:54:55,924 --> 00:54:58,293
- Do you have ketchup?

737
00:54:58,327 --> 00:55:01,196
- You do not eat ketchup
with these eggs.

738
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:04,900
- Is that truffle?

739
00:55:06,034 --> 00:55:08,003
- It is.

740
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:13,876
Do you still want ketchup?

741
00:55:13,909 --> 00:55:16,979
- I love ketchup.
I'm sorry.

742
00:55:17,012 --> 00:55:18,347
- Americani!

743
00:55:24,086 --> 00:55:27,189
You pollute
your own plate, not mine.

744
00:55:34,363 --> 00:55:36,765
Bernice. Hey, listen,
can I call you back?

745
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:38,734
I'm in the middle
of something.

746
00:55:38,767 --> 00:55:40,969
- This can't wait.
We're being sued.

747
00:55:46,842 --> 00:55:49,344
- Ladies, Mr. Cross,
I believe both our parties

748
00:55:49,378 --> 00:55:51,246
are here
for the same thing:

749
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,883
a quick and uncomplicated
resolution to this matter.

750
00:55:54,917 --> 00:55:57,052
- This matter got
complicated the moment

751
00:55:57,085 --> 00:55:59,087
your client filed
this frivolous lawsuit.

752
00:55:59,121 --> 00:56:02,090
- My client's character
has been repeatedly attacked

753
00:56:02,124 --> 00:56:03,258
in Ms. Davis' blog.

754
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:07,696
I thought we were
here to negotiate.

755
00:56:07,729 --> 00:56:08,964
Obviously, I was wrong.

756
00:56:08,997 --> 00:56:10,832
- What are you proposing?

757
00:56:16,138 --> 00:56:18,373
- We believe $3 million
is a fair number.

758
00:56:18,407 --> 00:56:20,776
- That's ridiculous!

759
00:56:20,809 --> 00:56:22,110
- That's our offer.

760
00:56:22,144 --> 00:56:24,846
Considering the circumstances,
I would suggest

761
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,848
your client seriously
think about it.

762
00:56:26,882 --> 00:56:29,217
- Circumstances?
You have to be kidding me.

763
00:56:29,251 --> 00:56:30,719
You barely have a case.

764
00:56:32,988 --> 00:56:34,389
We'll see you in court.

765
00:56:34,423 --> 00:56:36,291
- Suit yourself.

766
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,997
I'm sure a jury will find
Ms. Davis' choice of company...

767
00:56:43,432 --> 00:56:45,300
quite interesting.

768
00:56:49,037 --> 00:56:51,940
This has to be a mistake.

769
00:56:51,974 --> 00:56:53,742
- The mugshot
looks real to me.

770
00:56:53,775 --> 00:56:57,112
I just don't know the specifics
of the crime yet. That's all.

771
00:56:57,145 --> 00:56:58,814
- You said he had
a clean record.

772
00:56:58,847 --> 00:57:01,717
- Well, nothing came up
on my database.

773
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:04,252
So I put a call in
to my FBI contact,

774
00:57:04,286 --> 00:57:06,288
asked him to
look into Interpol.

775
00:57:06,321 --> 00:57:07,923
And this is
what he found.

776
00:57:08,924 --> 00:57:11,693
- I finally meet
someone I like.

777
00:57:11,727 --> 00:57:13,762
- Have you spoken
to him again yet?

778
00:57:13,795 --> 00:57:16,331
- No. I cancelled
our date for tonight.

779
00:57:16,365 --> 00:57:19,134
- Good. I want you to
stay away from him

780
00:57:19,167 --> 00:57:21,370
until we know exactly
what he's hiding.

781
00:57:22,804 --> 00:57:25,107
- What about Darryl?

782
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:28,710
- The hotel's sending
tapes in this afternoon.

783
00:57:28,744 --> 00:57:32,247
They had 15 active security
cameras working that day,

784
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,783
so I've assigned 2 guys
to go through them.

785
00:57:34,816 --> 00:57:37,986
As soon as I find something,
Amelia, I'll give you a call.

786
00:57:39,388 --> 00:57:42,324
- OK. Thanks.

787
00:57:42,357 --> 00:57:43,692
- Yeah.

788
00:59:25,927 --> 00:59:28,029
Amelia, what were
you thinking?

789
00:59:28,063 --> 00:59:29,264
- I know it was stupid.

790
00:59:29,297 --> 00:59:31,433
- You're just lucky
they didn't see you.

791
00:59:31,466 --> 00:59:34,035
- Well, at least
I know the truth.

792
00:59:34,069 --> 00:59:35,871
- Yeah, well, there's more.

793
00:59:35,904 --> 00:59:38,874
'Cause while you were out
playing private eye,

794
00:59:38,907 --> 00:59:41,243
I got a call from
my contact in Italy.

795
00:59:41,276 --> 00:59:44,446
Carlo Rossi
has no arrest record.

796
00:59:44,479 --> 00:59:47,015
But under the name
of Carlo Mancini,

797
00:59:47,048 --> 00:59:51,386
he was arrested on 4 accounts of
fraud and extortion 4 years ago.

798
00:59:51,419 --> 00:59:53,188
All charges were dropped.

799
00:59:54,189 --> 00:59:55,290
- How come?

800
00:59:55,323 --> 00:59:56,992
- Well, as it turns out,

801
00:59:57,025 --> 01:00:00,395
Carlo's family owns some
major real estate in Naples.

802
01:00:01,563 --> 01:00:04,065
They have a lot
of influence out there.

803
01:00:04,099 --> 01:00:05,000
The guy I spoke to

804
01:00:05,033 --> 01:00:07,602
didn't even wanna talk
about it on the phone.

805
01:00:07,636 --> 01:00:10,338
So I'm gonna be calling
the investigating officer

806
01:00:10,372 --> 01:00:12,541
later tonight to get
some more information.

807
01:00:12,574 --> 01:00:15,210
I even put a call in
to Homeland Security

808
01:00:15,243 --> 01:00:18,013
to find out the condition
of his work visa.

809
01:00:19,247 --> 01:00:21,516
- God, I feel so stupid!

810
01:00:22,517 --> 01:00:23,718
- It wasn't your fault.

811
01:00:23,752 --> 01:00:27,522
- He and Darryl must've been
planning this the whole time.

812
01:00:29,057 --> 01:00:31,159
- Look, you just
gotta promise me

813
01:00:31,193 --> 01:00:33,328
that you'll stay
far away from this guy, OK?

814
01:00:33,361 --> 01:00:35,363
Until after we sort
this whole thing out.

815
01:00:35,397 --> 01:00:37,966
I have the paperwork for
a restraining order for you.

816
01:00:37,999 --> 01:00:42,270
- You know what works better
than a restraining order? A gun.

817
01:00:43,605 --> 01:00:46,541
- Look, Amelia, you have
to understand that a gun

818
01:00:46,575 --> 01:00:49,578
is not a way of reclaiming
power or striking back.

819
01:00:49,611 --> 01:00:52,347
I mean, a gun's a means
of defending yourself

820
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:54,583
when there's
no other alternative.

821
01:00:54,616 --> 01:00:56,184
You understand that?

822
01:00:56,218 --> 01:00:59,087
- I don't wanna rely on
some judge to protect me.

823
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:01,923
Now that I know who it is,
I can protect myself.

824
01:01:41,029 --> 01:01:46,001
It's impossible to feel safe
and protected all the time.

825
01:01:46,034 --> 01:01:48,536
In one way or another,
we are all vulnerable.

826
01:01:54,542 --> 01:01:57,712
Those that we let in know
where we hurt the most,

827
01:01:57,746 --> 01:02:00,949
our worst fears,
our insecurities.

828
01:02:02,317 --> 01:02:05,053
Hi, I'm not here to take
your call right now.

829
01:02:05,086 --> 01:02:06,488
Please leave me a message.

830
01:02:12,227 --> 01:02:14,462
Those who want
to get in but can't

831
01:02:14,496 --> 01:02:16,431
look for cracks
in our armour.

832
01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:25,173
- But is your investigation
on Carlo Mancini...

833
01:02:25,206 --> 01:02:26,474
Is it still ongoing?

834
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:33,081
Yes. Yes, I would appreciate
receiving a copy of the file.

835
01:02:34,482 --> 01:02:38,053
-But it is how we deal
with our vulnerabilities

836
01:02:38,086 --> 01:02:42,023
that we define our strengths
and our weaknesses.

837
01:02:42,057 --> 01:02:44,459
And while I know
I can't change the past,

838
01:02:44,492 --> 01:02:47,395
I believe that being a victim
is a state of mind.

839
01:02:48,663 --> 01:02:51,299
I am going to change
my state of mind.

840
01:03:00,642 --> 01:03:03,378
"Never back down"
is only the beginning.

841
01:03:03,411 --> 01:03:05,647
The end is when
we are confident,

842
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:09,584
secure in who we are,
able to defend ourselves.

843
01:03:13,521 --> 01:03:16,124
Defamation of character?

844
01:03:16,157 --> 01:03:19,594
Intentional infliction
of emotional distress?

845
01:03:19,627 --> 01:03:21,629
This is all lies!

846
01:03:21,663 --> 01:03:24,666
- From a legal standpoint,
they're gonna lose.

847
01:03:24,699 --> 01:03:27,369
But I've been up
against Lana Grey before,

848
01:03:27,402 --> 01:03:29,270
and she'll take this
to the end

849
01:03:29,304 --> 01:03:31,139
just to keep seeing
herself on TV.

850
01:03:32,173 --> 01:03:34,309
Pictures of you
with a convict

851
01:03:34,342 --> 01:03:35,543
won't go over well

852
01:03:35,577 --> 01:03:38,680
with your audience or
with the advertisers,

853
01:03:38,713 --> 01:03:40,515
even if this was
all a setup.

854
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:44,285
- This is
my private life.

855
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:46,621
I didn't do
anything wrong.

856
01:03:46,654 --> 01:03:50,525
- No, but that doesn't matter
in the court of public opinion.

857
01:03:50,558 --> 01:03:55,230
If you lose your credibility,
you lose everything.

858
01:03:56,331 --> 01:04:00,402
Modern Media Works is willing
to pay all the money

859
01:04:00,435 --> 01:04:02,337
for this
to go away quietly.

860
01:04:03,338 --> 01:04:04,773
It won't cost
you a thing.

861
01:04:04,806 --> 01:04:06,307
- Yes, it will.

862
01:04:06,341 --> 01:04:09,511
I'm tired of being
pushed around.

863
01:04:33,902 --> 01:04:35,437
-My papers are in order.

864
01:04:35,470 --> 01:04:37,839
I still don't know
what you want from me.

865
01:04:37,872 --> 01:04:39,908
- It says here
you're a lying thief

866
01:04:39,941 --> 01:04:42,277
who extorts grieving
women for money.

867
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:44,345
- This is out of
your jurisdiction.

868
01:04:44,379 --> 01:04:46,748
And all those charges
against me were dismissed.

869
01:04:47,749 --> 01:04:48,683
- Tell me something.

870
01:04:48,716 --> 01:04:51,152
What's your involvement
with Darryl Devine?

871
01:04:51,186 --> 01:04:53,588
- I'm not talking
without my lawyer.

872
01:04:53,621 --> 01:04:56,458
- 'Cause you 2 guys seem
to have a lot in common.

873
01:04:56,491 --> 01:04:57,759
You know what I think?

874
01:04:57,792 --> 01:05:01,262
I think you read about
Ms. Davis' upcoming payday

875
01:05:01,296 --> 01:05:03,765
and you thought to yourself:
"Easy score."

876
01:05:03,798 --> 01:05:05,900
- That's a lie.

877
01:05:05,934 --> 01:05:10,638
- We know all about
your family back in Italy.

878
01:05:10,672 --> 01:05:13,241
Portfolio's not
what it used to be, is it?

879
01:05:14,275 --> 01:05:15,777
So what have
we got so far?

880
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:20,281
You've got a history of taking
advantage of women for money.

881
01:05:20,315 --> 01:05:22,917
You conveniently
pop up out of nowhere

882
01:05:22,951 --> 01:05:25,386
just when Miss Davis
is about to sell her blog.

883
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:27,755
You've been seen associating
with her ex-husband

884
01:05:27,789 --> 01:05:29,924
who just so happens to
be suing her right now

885
01:05:29,958 --> 01:05:31,392
and using you
for leverage.

886
01:05:31,426 --> 01:05:33,862
I mean, that's a pretty
tight fit isn't it?

887
01:05:33,895 --> 01:05:36,631
One phone call to immigration

888
01:05:36,664 --> 01:05:39,901
about a potential
extortion on US soil

889
01:05:39,934 --> 01:05:42,370
and neither Carlo Rossi
or Carlo Mancini

890
01:05:42,403 --> 01:05:45,507
will ever set foot in this
country again, you got that?

891
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:48,610
- Federal crimes,
out of your jurisdiction.

892
01:05:48,643 --> 01:05:50,612
- Jurisdiction.
Yeah, I know.

893
01:05:50,645 --> 01:05:53,548
I know, I know.
You keep reminding me.

894
01:05:53,581 --> 01:05:56,784
For an innocent man, you sure
seem to know an awful lot

895
01:05:56,818 --> 01:05:58,786
about the judicial system.

896
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:01,856
- I came to this country
to start over again.

897
01:06:02,790 --> 01:06:05,260
That's why
I changed my name.

898
01:06:05,293 --> 01:06:07,262
It has nothing
to do with you.

899
01:06:07,295 --> 01:06:08,663
- And that's
where you're wrong.

900
01:06:08,696 --> 01:06:10,932
Because when it comes
to Miss Davis' security,

901
01:06:10,965 --> 01:06:12,567
it has everything
to do with me.

902
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,836
-I was trying
to protect her!

903
01:06:14,869 --> 01:06:16,838
- How?

904
01:06:16,871 --> 01:06:20,575
By plotting with her abusive
ex-husband to extort her?

905
01:06:20,608 --> 01:06:23,311
-I tried to
pay him off, all right?

906
01:06:23,344 --> 01:06:25,547
So he would
leave her alone.

907
01:06:26,581 --> 01:06:27,749
It's you, Wilson.

908
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:30,752
You who can't protect her.

909
01:06:31,753 --> 01:06:33,955
She's in danger,

910
01:06:33,988 --> 01:06:36,758
and I'm trying
to keep her safe.

911
01:06:39,494 --> 01:06:42,397
- I'll be keeping
an eye on you, Carlo.

912
01:06:43,932 --> 01:06:46,901
- Isn't that
what you told Darryl?

913
01:06:53,641 --> 01:06:56,878
- It was like I was looking
at a complete stranger.

914
01:06:56,911 --> 01:06:58,746
- You couldn't have known.

915
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:00,281
- But I should have.

916
01:07:00,315 --> 01:07:02,684
When things went bad
with Darryl,

917
01:07:02,717 --> 01:07:05,486
I was young, naive.

918
01:07:06,654 --> 01:07:08,556
Now I know what people
are capable of

919
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:10,592
and I still opened
myself up to this.

920
01:07:10,625 --> 01:07:12,560
- So you took
a chance on someone.

921
01:07:14,762 --> 01:07:18,633
- I barely knew him.
I just can't trust anyone.

922
01:07:18,666 --> 01:07:21,069
- If you'd have shut
yourself off after Darryl,

923
01:07:21,102 --> 01:07:23,771
you never would've gotten
your life back on track.

924
01:07:23,805 --> 01:07:27,875
You never would've started the
blog. You never would've met me.

925
01:07:30,678 --> 01:07:31,879
- I know you're right.

926
01:07:33,615 --> 01:07:37,418
I'm just so frustrated that I've
allowed these guys to affect me.

927
01:07:38,419 --> 01:07:41,022
I'm tired of
feeling victimized.

928
01:07:42,056 --> 01:07:44,058
- What about
the lawsuit?

929
01:07:45,159 --> 01:07:48,029
- The thought of them
walking away with one cent

930
01:07:48,062 --> 01:07:49,063
makes me sick.

931
01:07:50,064 --> 01:07:51,599
- Whose decision is it?

932
01:07:51,633 --> 01:07:52,967
- Mine.

933
01:07:54,569 --> 01:07:57,672
But Modern Media Works
can terminate my contract.

934
01:07:57,705 --> 01:07:59,540
- Well, that won't happen.

935
01:08:00,675 --> 01:08:03,378
- At this point, I don't
care about the job

936
01:08:03,411 --> 01:08:04,779
or the blog
or the money.

937
01:08:04,812 --> 01:08:08,316
Darryl and Carlo think
that they can exploit me.

938
01:08:13,821 --> 01:08:16,524
- Is there
anything I can do?

939
01:08:19,994 --> 01:08:22,096
- Can you stay over tonight?

940
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:24,332
- Of course.

941
01:08:36,811 --> 01:08:38,713
- This is early
for you, Bernice.

942
01:08:38,746 --> 01:08:40,715
- Amelia, turn on the TV.

943
01:08:40,748 --> 01:08:42,417
-What channel?
- 97.

944
01:08:48,489 --> 01:08:50,458
- Look, I paid for my crimes.

945
01:08:50,491 --> 01:08:53,494
But this media pressure,
this hounding

946
01:08:53,528 --> 01:08:57,098
has--has caused extreme
emotional stress on me.

947
01:08:57,131 --> 01:08:58,332
- My God!

948
01:08:58,366 --> 01:09:02,437
-All this because of
Amelia Davis, media darling.

949
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:05,006
What's excessive is the
vindictive and unjust way

950
01:09:05,039 --> 01:09:06,407
that I've been treated.

951
01:09:06,441 --> 01:09:07,809
It's not about the money.

952
01:09:07,842 --> 01:09:10,478
It's about justice
and doing what's right.

953
01:09:10,511 --> 01:09:13,448
-Please tell me
what happened.

954
01:09:14,916 --> 01:09:16,984
- What the hell
does this mean, Bernice?

955
01:09:18,019 --> 01:09:20,154
- Scare tactics.
But it worked.

956
01:09:20,188 --> 01:09:22,757
Modern Media Works
wants to settle.

957
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:23,758
- No way.

958
01:09:24,926 --> 01:09:27,695
-Don't worry.
Grosslight has deep pockets.

959
01:09:27,729 --> 01:09:30,498
- I don't care. Let them
try to take this to court.

960
01:09:30,531 --> 01:09:31,899
Let them
release the photos.

961
01:09:31,933 --> 01:09:33,768
But I'm not
agreeing to anything.

962
01:09:33,801 --> 01:09:35,770
- OK. I'll call you
when I know more.

963
01:09:35,803 --> 01:09:36,804
- OK.

964
01:09:41,209 --> 01:09:45,646
- My God! I feel like my life
is completely out of my hands.

965
01:09:50,084 --> 01:09:51,986
Wilson called.

966
01:09:52,019 --> 01:09:55,523
He said that they caught Darryl
on the surveillance tapes.

967
01:09:55,556 --> 01:09:58,826
- That's fantastic!
When can they arrest him?

968
01:09:59,961 --> 01:10:02,196
- The DA needs to
sign off on the warrant.

969
01:10:02,230 --> 01:10:03,698
But it shouldn't be long.

970
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:08,870
I really need to get out
of the city for a while.

971
01:10:11,706 --> 01:10:15,676
- What about that spa you sent
me to last year for my birthday?

972
01:10:17,712 --> 01:10:21,015
- Yeah, now you're talking.
That's exactly what I need.

973
01:10:21,048 --> 01:10:22,617
- What we need.

974
01:10:22,650 --> 01:10:24,685
- You'll go with me?

975
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:27,622
- You don't think I'd let you
go anywhere alone, do you?

976
01:10:28,656 --> 01:10:30,458
- Thank you.

977
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:48,009
I think somebody's
following us.

978
01:10:50,545 --> 01:10:52,914
- Probably just
a coincidence.

979
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:57,084
- It's Carlo!

980
01:10:57,118 --> 01:10:58,953
- He's coming.

981
01:11:04,258 --> 01:11:05,827
- Pull over!

982
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:07,528
- Leave me alone!

983
01:11:07,562 --> 01:11:09,597
- Pull over! I need
to talk to you.

984
01:11:22,009 --> 01:11:23,077
- Careful!

985
01:11:36,123 --> 01:11:39,594
- Amelia! Pick up
your cell phone!

986
01:11:44,665 --> 01:11:46,067
Amelia!

987
01:11:47,068 --> 01:11:48,302
- Leave me alone!

988
01:11:48,336 --> 01:11:50,671
- Pick up the phone!

989
01:12:25,239 --> 01:12:27,375
- How is he?

990
01:12:27,408 --> 01:12:29,277
- It doesn't look good.

991
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:31,812
We had to let him go
after the interrogation.

992
01:12:31,846 --> 01:12:33,781
We didn't have enough
to hold him on.

993
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:36,918
- I just wanna go home.

994
01:12:42,056 --> 01:12:45,026
- So anyway,
it was pretty interesting.

995
01:12:45,059 --> 01:12:46,027
There she is!

996
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:47,762
She's coming back.

997
01:12:47,795 --> 01:12:48,996
Get her, get her.

998
01:12:51,299 --> 01:12:52,366
Here she comes.

999
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,734
Ms. Davis, Ms. Davis!

1000
01:12:53,768 --> 01:12:56,170
What is your relationship
with Mr. Mancini?

1001
01:12:56,203 --> 01:12:57,972
Are you
romantically involved?

1002
01:12:58,005 --> 01:13:00,274
Amelia, have the police
laid any charges?

1003
01:13:00,308 --> 01:13:02,777
- She has no comment.
Leave her alone.

1004
01:13:02,810 --> 01:13:05,379
- Ms. Davis! Can you
make any comment?

1005
01:13:05,413 --> 01:13:06,781
- Amelia! Amelia!

1006
01:13:06,814 --> 01:13:08,950
Amelia,
one more question!

1007
01:13:18,392 --> 01:13:20,628
- I'll take the couch.

1008
01:13:41,215 --> 01:13:44,719
- This just came in.
You better take a look at it.

1009
01:13:48,155 --> 01:13:50,691
- No wonder they
didn't prosecute.

1010
01:13:50,725 --> 01:13:52,860
The whole case
was frivolous.

1011
01:13:52,893 --> 01:13:56,097
Seems like the women were the
ones trying to shake him down.

1012
01:13:56,130 --> 01:13:58,766
- Based on these bank
statements, I can see why.

1013
01:13:58,799 --> 01:14:00,401
- Yeah.

1014
01:14:00,434 --> 01:14:02,103
- But his money
won't help him now.

1015
01:14:02,136 --> 01:14:03,304
- Thanks.

1016
01:14:09,844 --> 01:14:11,212
-Hello?

1017
01:14:11,245 --> 01:14:14,148
- Amelia, I have
some news about Carlo.

1018
01:14:17,485 --> 01:14:20,121
- No questions,
but I have a statement.

1019
01:14:22,089 --> 01:14:25,326
I had a relationship with
Carlo Mancini that ended

1020
01:14:25,359 --> 01:14:27,962
because I chose
to believe information

1021
01:14:27,995 --> 01:14:29,897
that turned out
to be untrue.

1022
01:14:29,930 --> 01:14:33,300
I pray Carlo recovers and
that I will get the chance

1023
01:14:33,334 --> 01:14:35,002
to speak with him again,

1024
01:14:35,036 --> 01:14:37,138
to apologize
for doubting him.

1025
01:14:37,171 --> 01:14:40,341
But I will not apologize
to my ex-husband,

1026
01:14:40,374 --> 01:14:42,209
whose allegations
against me

1027
01:14:42,243 --> 01:14:45,079
are just another attempt
at intimidation.

1028
01:14:45,112 --> 01:14:48,482
Abuse disguises itself
in many forms.

1029
01:14:48,516 --> 01:14:51,152
It can be physical
or psychological.

1030
01:14:51,185 --> 01:14:54,789
It feeds on our insecurities
and aims to strip us

1031
01:14:54,822 --> 01:14:57,324
of our identity
and self-worth.

1032
01:14:57,358 --> 01:15:00,895
But I know who I am and
I know who you are, Darryl.

1033
01:15:00,928 --> 01:15:02,830
You are a selfish, arrogant,

1034
01:15:02,863 --> 01:15:05,066
pathetic excuse
for a human being.

1035
01:15:05,099 --> 01:15:08,035
And if you wanna up
your lawsuit for defamation

1036
01:15:08,069 --> 01:15:10,237
because I said that,
go right ahead.

1037
01:15:10,271 --> 01:15:13,274
Because no matter
what you threaten to do,

1038
01:15:13,307 --> 01:15:14,975
I will never back down.

1039
01:15:15,009 --> 01:15:16,477
Thank you.

1040
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:18,479
- One question.
What about the lawsuit?

1041
01:15:18,512 --> 01:15:20,848
Are you in love
with him? Amelia!

1042
01:15:20,881 --> 01:15:22,183
- Amelia!
- Ms. Davis!

1043
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:28,856
- I'm so proud of you.

1044
01:15:32,126 --> 01:15:33,527
- Thank you.

1045
01:15:43,237 --> 01:15:44,338
- What have you got?

1046
01:15:44,371 --> 01:15:46,907
- That warrant you
want for Darryl Devine?

1047
01:15:46,941 --> 01:15:48,409
- Yeah.
- DA just signed it.

1048
01:15:48,442 --> 01:15:52,346
- I want 4 uniforms at Darryl
Devine's place immediately.

1049
01:15:52,379 --> 01:15:53,347
- OK.

1050
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:54,782
- Possible take down.

1051
01:15:56,584 --> 01:15:59,220
Police! Open up, Mr. Devine!

1052
01:16:17,605 --> 01:16:19,907
Yeah, it's me.
He's gone.

1053
01:16:19,940 --> 01:16:23,043
Put out an APB
on him and his truck.

1054
01:16:26,013 --> 01:16:30,084
- OK. Thanks, Hank.
I appreciate it.

1055
01:16:33,087 --> 01:16:35,055
Darryl's on the loose again.

1056
01:16:35,089 --> 01:16:37,458
- It never ends.

1057
01:16:37,491 --> 01:16:39,326
- You went out?

1058
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:42,563
- Yeah, there's a horde
of reporters out there.

1059
01:16:42,596 --> 01:16:45,466
Your TV appearance
made everything worse.

1060
01:16:45,499 --> 01:16:49,136
- My God! This is
getting ridiculous.

1061
01:16:49,170 --> 01:16:52,173
- You're coming home with me.
- They're just gonna follow us.

1062
01:16:52,206 --> 01:16:54,441
- I'm ahead of you.
I put my car in the back.

1063
01:16:56,177 --> 01:16:58,579
- It can be physical
or psychological.

1064
01:16:58,612 --> 01:17:02,049
It feeds on our insecurities
and aims to strip us

1065
01:17:02,082 --> 01:17:04,151
of our identity
and self-worth.

1066
01:17:04,185 --> 01:17:07,488
But I know who I am and
I know who you are, Darryl.

1067
01:17:07,521 --> 01:17:10,124
You are a selfish, arrogant...

1068
01:17:11,659 --> 01:17:13,294
- ... excuse
for a human being.

1069
01:17:13,327 --> 01:17:14,195
- Bitch!

1070
01:17:14,228 --> 01:17:16,297
-If you wanna
up your lawsuit

1071
01:17:16,330 --> 01:17:18,465
because I said that,
go right ahead.

1072
01:17:18,499 --> 01:17:21,302
Because no matter
what you threaten to do,

1073
01:17:21,335 --> 01:17:24,004
I will never back down.
Thank you.

1074
01:17:39,653 --> 01:17:41,989
- Every time I try to relax...

1075
01:17:42,022 --> 01:17:43,123
- Who is it?

1076
01:17:44,158 --> 01:17:45,492
- It's Bernice.

1077
01:17:45,526 --> 01:17:46,660
- Voice mail.

1078
01:17:47,695 --> 01:17:50,197
- Bernice, what's up?

1079
01:17:50,231 --> 01:17:51,365
- After your TV performance,

1080
01:17:51,398 --> 01:17:53,934
the server went nuts
from all the traffic.

1081
01:17:53,968 --> 01:17:57,137
Shut the whole thing down.
It's back up again, though.

1082
01:17:57,171 --> 01:17:59,139
- Were the responses
good or bad?

1083
01:17:59,173 --> 01:18:02,009
- Your fans are
showering you with love.

1084
01:18:02,042 --> 01:18:04,511
- What about Darryl
and the lawsuit?

1085
01:18:04,545 --> 01:18:07,281
- Modern Media Works
is backing you 100%.

1086
01:18:07,314 --> 01:18:09,083
They don't want to settle.

1087
01:18:09,116 --> 01:18:10,951
Darryl is a footnote.

1088
01:18:10,985 --> 01:18:12,486
- That's fantastic!

1089
01:18:12,519 --> 01:18:14,088
- It gets better.

1090
01:18:14,121 --> 01:18:17,625
I've had 50 calls
for interview requests.

1091
01:18:17,658 --> 01:18:19,426
And I don't mean affiliates.

1092
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:21,629
I'm talking the ones
that go by one name.

1093
01:18:21,662 --> 01:18:24,231
And Random House
wants the book rights.

1094
01:18:24,265 --> 01:18:25,399
- This is unbelievable!

1095
01:18:25,432 --> 01:18:28,302
- Call me in the morning.
We'll strategize.

1096
01:18:28,335 --> 01:18:30,170
- OK, thank you.

1097
01:18:30,204 --> 01:18:32,172
- So?

1098
01:18:32,206 --> 01:18:35,576
- Darryl is out of luck
on all fronts.

1099
01:18:35,609 --> 01:18:39,580
- Modern Media Works took its
settlement offer off the table?

1100
01:18:39,613 --> 01:18:40,714
- For good.

1101
01:18:40,748 --> 01:18:43,183
- Things are looking up
for you, girl.

1102
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:49,056
- I feel like I wanna write
something on the blog.

1103
01:18:49,089 --> 01:18:51,292
Do you mind if I go upstairs?
- Sure.

1104
01:18:51,325 --> 01:18:53,193
- OK.

1105
01:18:56,230 --> 01:18:59,633
Every instance of abuse
has 2 victims.

1106
01:19:00,634 --> 01:19:02,503
The second is trust.

1107
01:19:04,038 --> 01:19:07,107
When the person you
trusted more than anyone

1108
01:19:07,141 --> 01:19:09,610
turns on you and
destroys that trust,

1109
01:19:09,643 --> 01:19:13,280
you think you will never
let anyone in ever again.

1110
01:19:18,252 --> 01:19:21,455
I've recently allowed myself
to have faith in someone.

1111
01:19:22,756 --> 01:19:25,125
For the first time
in a long time,

1112
01:19:25,159 --> 01:19:26,160
I can say...

1113
01:19:27,528 --> 01:19:30,531
"I have a friend
and I trust her."

1114
01:20:41,368 --> 01:20:42,803
- I need a beer.

1115
01:20:42,836 --> 01:20:45,305
- What the hell
do you think you're doing?

1116
01:20:45,339 --> 01:20:47,741
- The lawsuit is dead.

1117
01:20:50,711 --> 01:20:54,248
- Shhh! One more step
and you're dead.

1118
01:20:55,616 --> 01:20:57,251
- Put it down.

1119
01:20:57,284 --> 01:20:59,520
- You're not gonna
screw this up for me.

1120
01:20:59,553 --> 01:21:02,289
- For you? I thought
we were in this together.

1121
01:21:02,322 --> 01:21:04,591
We
were supposed
to get our sweet Amelia.

1122
01:21:04,625 --> 01:21:07,828
- We were. But then the
boyfriend got in the way.

1123
01:21:07,861 --> 01:21:09,730
- So what do we do now?

1124
01:21:09,763 --> 01:21:13,467
- Like you said,
the lawsuit's dead.

1125
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,102
So are you.

1126
01:21:48,335 --> 01:21:51,772
"Dear Amelia: Your words
have given me courage.

1127
01:21:51,805 --> 01:21:54,775
"She has
pushed me around too long.

1128
01:21:54,808 --> 01:21:56,243
"I was embarrassed...

1129
01:21:56,276 --> 01:21:58,912
"Because my abuser is my wife.

1130
01:22:00,814 --> 01:22:02,816
"But tonight...

1131
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:06,153
"I stand up for myself.

1132
01:22:07,421 --> 01:22:09,823
"Tonight, I tell her
that it is over.

1133
01:22:09,857 --> 01:22:11,792
"I am leaving
her for good.

1134
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:16,763
"Thanks for guiding me
through the hurt.

1135
01:22:16,797 --> 01:22:18,832
"Trevor."

1136
01:22:30,244 --> 01:22:33,714
- Hey, what are you doing?
I thought you were working.

1137
01:22:35,849 --> 01:22:38,185
- It was all
a lie, wasn't it?

1138
01:22:38,986 --> 01:22:41,788
You were never
Embarrassed. Trevor was.

1139
01:22:41,822 --> 01:22:44,358
- He certainly was
an embarrassment.

1140
01:22:44,391 --> 01:22:46,426
- You were
the one abusing him.

1141
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:49,796
- I knew I should've thrown
this away. I just couldn't.

1142
01:22:49,830 --> 01:22:53,834
- Everything that you've
ever told me was a lie.

1143
01:22:54,868 --> 01:22:57,604
- Talk about the pot
calling the kettle.

1144
01:23:02,009 --> 01:23:04,444
Your entire life
is a concoction.

1145
01:23:04,478 --> 01:23:05,445
- Wait.

1146
01:23:05,479 --> 01:23:07,381
- You're not a hero.

1147
01:23:07,414 --> 01:23:10,317
You're a coward who hides behind
her keyboard and a mouse.

1148
01:23:10,350 --> 01:23:12,386
- My God!

1149
01:23:12,419 --> 01:23:14,555
- You let Darryl
push you around?

1150
01:23:14,588 --> 01:23:17,724
-You
should've
done that years ago.

1151
01:23:17,758 --> 01:23:19,927
- I'm not a killer.

1152
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:21,995
- No, you're not.
You're a victim.

1153
01:23:23,697 --> 01:23:25,699
- I trusted you.

1154
01:23:25,732 --> 01:23:28,535
- You are also a very bad
judge of character.

1155
01:23:28,569 --> 01:23:31,238
- What did I ever do to you?

1156
01:23:32,906 --> 01:23:35,008
- You ruined my life.

1157
01:23:37,044 --> 01:23:39,479
So I pushed
Trevor around a little.

1158
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:43,750
It worked for us.
We were happy.

1159
01:23:46,053 --> 01:23:49,590
And then he started
reading your garbage.

1160
01:23:49,623 --> 01:23:51,525
"Never back down."

1161
01:23:52,893 --> 01:23:54,861
What a joke!

1162
01:23:55,862 --> 01:23:57,831
Got him all fired up.

1163
01:24:05,072 --> 01:24:06,773
- What are you doing?

1164
01:24:11,478 --> 01:24:14,381
- So you believe
that garbage?

1165
01:24:14,414 --> 01:24:15,782
- Yes.

1166
01:24:17,084 --> 01:24:18,619
This is it.

1167
01:24:18,652 --> 01:24:20,520
This, this is it.
We're through.

1168
01:24:20,554 --> 01:24:22,856
- So this is it.
This is your big stand.

1169
01:24:22,889 --> 01:24:25,025
You don't have the balls
to fight back?

1170
01:24:25,058 --> 01:24:27,494
- You don't know
what I'm capable of.

1171
01:24:29,062 --> 01:24:31,365
- Unfortunately, Trevor,

1172
01:24:31,398 --> 01:24:34,401
I know exactly what
you're capable of.

1173
01:24:38,972 --> 01:24:40,974
Put it down, Trevor.

1174
01:24:52,819 --> 01:24:54,521
I didn't have a choice.

1175
01:24:54,554 --> 01:24:57,524
Thanks to you, the police
assumed I was the victim.

1176
01:24:57,557 --> 01:24:59,493
I just had to show
them the letters.

1177
01:24:59,526 --> 01:25:00,494
Except this one.

1178
01:25:00,527 --> 01:25:02,562
So when you
think about it,

1179
01:25:02,596 --> 01:25:04,698
it's your fault
Trevor died.

1180
01:25:04,731 --> 01:25:06,433
- You're sick!

1181
01:25:06,466 --> 01:25:07,601
- Yeah.

1182
01:25:08,602 --> 01:25:09,836
The funny part is

1183
01:25:09,870 --> 01:25:12,706
Darryl's the one who
cared about the money.

1184
01:25:12,739 --> 01:25:14,708
I didn't care
about the money.

1185
01:25:14,741 --> 01:25:16,977
I just wanted
to make you suffer.

1186
01:25:18,979 --> 01:25:21,715
And then you gave me
the writing job.

1187
01:25:22,883 --> 01:25:26,620
And now I'm going to have
everything that you have.

1188
01:25:26,653 --> 01:25:28,422
When you think about it,

1189
01:25:28,455 --> 01:25:31,725
that is the sweetest
kind of revenge.

1190
01:25:31,758 --> 01:25:33,527
- You'll never
get away with this.

1191
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:35,128
- You are
so wrong, sweetheart.

1192
01:25:35,162 --> 01:25:37,864
When the world finds out
that I killed Darryl

1193
01:25:37,898 --> 01:25:40,000
in an attempt
to protect you,

1194
01:25:40,033 --> 01:25:43,737
Modern Media Works is gonna
pass the torch on to me.

1195
01:25:43,770 --> 01:25:46,406
And I will continue
to lead the fight

1196
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:50,944
on behalf of our fallen
martyr, Amelia Davis.

1197
01:26:12,566 --> 01:26:14,568
- I wish I'd gotten
to you earlier.

1198
01:26:15,836 --> 01:26:17,938
Luckily, you called me
when you did.

1199
01:26:18,939 --> 01:26:20,774
- I don't feel lucky.

1200
01:26:20,807 --> 01:26:22,509
- This isn't your fault.

1201
01:26:22,542 --> 01:26:25,746
There was no choice.
It was either you or her.

1202
01:26:28,181 --> 01:26:30,117
I've got some good news.

1203
01:26:30,150 --> 01:26:33,653
Carlo woke up.
He's gonna be OK.

1204
01:26:34,688 --> 01:26:36,823
He was asking about you.

1205
01:26:44,197 --> 01:26:47,134
Here comes the press.
We better get you home.

1206
01:26:49,703 --> 01:26:52,105
No more vehicles

1207
01:26:52,139 --> 01:26:54,107
on the parade route for today.

1208
01:27:02,048 --> 01:27:04,084
- You take care

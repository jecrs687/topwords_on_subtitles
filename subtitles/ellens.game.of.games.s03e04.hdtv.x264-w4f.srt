1
00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:07,039
 - You're about to see something
        very special: me.

2
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:20,452
    - When was the last time
   either of you got blasted?

3
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:22,054
- Um...

4
00:00:22,056 --> 00:00:23,655
    - When was the last time
         you got bucked?

5
00:00:25,326 --> 00:00:26,392
      - Don't answer that.

6
00:00:28,763 --> 00:00:29,762
    - Oh, Ellen, I love you.

7
00:00:29,764 --> 00:00:31,697
- I love you too.

8
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:34,033
         - And you are?
          - I'm Amber,

9
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:35,467
 and I love you so much, Ellen.

10
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:37,770
    - Oh, thank you so much.
   Well, I hope you win then.

11
00:00:40,508 --> 00:00:42,975
      - Ellen, I love you.
        - I love you too.

12
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:50,082
          - She's gone.
  I don't know where she went.

13
00:00:54,455 --> 00:01:00,959
   - Give it up for your host,
        Ellen DeGeneres!

14
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,004
      - Thank you so much.

15
00:01:12,006 --> 00:01:13,439
      Thank you very much.
          Have a seat.

16
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:15,007
 Welcome to my "Game of Games."

17
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:17,276
 We have got a big show for you
 tonight with lots of big games.

18
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:19,144
  When you watch tonight's show
      you're going to feel

19
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:21,613
       excited and nervous
    and maybe even confused.

20
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:24,316
  It's the same way I feel when
   I listen to a Cardi B song,

21
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:26,852
    and here is the best part
       of tonight's show:

22
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:28,654
     Someone in the audience
    is going to have a chance

23
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:30,456
        to win $100,000.

24
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:38,864
  - And, by the way, you don't
     have to be here to win.

25
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:40,432
   You can play along at home.

26
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,968
 While I set up this next game,
     here's how you do that.

27
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:47,406
 <i> Open your "Game of Games" app,</i>
         <i> and you'll see</i>

28
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:50,142
    <i> a free scratcher ticket.</i>
     <i> During tonight's show,</i>

29
00:01:50,144 --> 00:01:52,644
         <i> a lucky penny</i>
   <i> will appear on the screen.</i>

30
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:55,380
     <i> Us your phone's camera</i>
     <i> to capture the penny.</i>

31
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:58,984
   <i> Then, you can scratch away</i>
    <i> and see what you've won.</i>

32
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:02,154
 <i> There are thousands of prizes,</i>
         <i> so good luck.</i>

33
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,327
           All right.
     Have a seat everybody.

34
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:10,796
           All right.
  So this game is like if a cop

35
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:13,232
    gives you a sobriety test
        after being drunk

36
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:15,501
   and then on a Tilt-A-Whirl
        at the same time.

37
00:02:15,503 --> 00:02:17,002
  It's time to play Dizzy Dash.

38
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:34,186
      - All right, tWitch.
      Who's going to play?

39
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:37,856
   - All right. Where are Alex
   Antenescu and Chidi Azema?

40
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:51,336
- How you doing, Ellen?.

41
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,172
  - Hi. Thank you so much. Hi.
       Which one are you?

42
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:54,673
             - Hey.
         - You're Alex.

43
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,375
           - I'm Alex Antenescu.

44
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:57,776
    I'm from Charlotte, North
   Carolina, and I'm in sales.

45
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:59,144
           - In sales?
             - Yeah.

46
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:00,512
      - What type of sales?
      - I'm outside sales.

47
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,014
    I, like, go out in the field

48
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,116
     and try to sell things
  to people, nicely hopefully.

49
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:05,551
             - Okay.
       - I kind of-- Yeah.

50
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:08,820
   - I don't know what you do,
    but I don't believe you.

51
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:10,255
     All right. And you are?
        - How you doing?

52
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:11,990
My name is Chidi Azema,
and I'm from New York.

53
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:13,458
      I'm a brand curator.

54
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,893
                    - All right.

55
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:16,595
  See, there's a clear answer,
        a brand curator.

56
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:18,931
   You just sell things, and I
 don't even know what you sell.

57
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:20,332
    Like, what kind of things
          do you sell?

58
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:21,633
 - I'm in the cannabis industry.
           I sell CBD.

59
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:23,035
            - I see.

60
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:24,536
   - So I'm in the CBD market.
         - There you go.

61
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,038
       -Yeah, yeah, yeah.
   - That's why you were like

62
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,539
        "outside sales."
    Yeah. Now we're talking.

63
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,474
     - Thank you. Thank you.
   - Don't dance around that.

64
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:30,909
 That's fine. So go have a seat
  in those chairs, by the way.

65
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,311
   They're comfortable. Okay?

66
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:33,412
             - Okay.
          - All right.

67
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:34,746
      - And then I'll show
        you how to play.

68
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:36,215
           - Let's go.

69
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:41,987
       <i> - After spinning,</i>
   <i> two contestants will race</i>

70
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:43,589
           <i> to answer</i>
    <i> my questions correctly.</i>

71
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:45,624
    <i> The first person to get</i>
 <i> three questions right moves on</i>

72
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:47,759
         <i> to Know or Go.</i>

73
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:52,297
  - All right. Here we go then.
      We're going to start.

74
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:55,000
       We're going to play
 until someone has three points

75
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:58,003
       or until I'm queasy
     from watching you both,

76
00:03:58,005 --> 00:03:59,171
     whichever comes first.

77
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:01,840
           All right.
     Let's play Dizzy Dash.

78
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:09,047
  - You're about to spin faster
    than a bike at SoulCycle.

79
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:11,250
       Speaking of which,
    if a bike has two wheels,

80
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:14,253
       a unicycle has one
    and a tricycle has three,

81
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:18,223
 what singer famously told Jesus
      to "take the wheel"?

82
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:20,792
           Spin them.

83
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:33,639
             - Whoa.

84
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:36,608
    That's some g-force shiz.

85
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:45,984
          - All righty.
       What is the answer?

86
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:47,185
    - Is it Carrie Underwood?

87
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:48,320
      - Yes, that is right!
              Yes!

88
00:04:48,322 --> 00:04:50,122
- Yeah! Let's go!

89
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:52,758
          - All right.

90
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,026
           - Good job.
            Good job.

91
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:59,197
             - Okay.

92
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,465
      I think the front row
      needs to be prepared

93
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,634
     to catch him next time
            because--

94
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,436
    - Bro, that's fast, man.
       - That was really--

95
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:06,905
    Yeah. Yeah, it goes fast.
     It's called Dizzy Dash.

96
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:09,641
           Here we go.

97
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,576
        If Ziggy Stardust
        was David Bowie,

98
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:15,180
     Mimi was Mariah Carey,
     Slim Shady was Eminem,

99
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:17,182
         whose alter ego
       was Hannah Montana?

100
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:18,216
            Spin 'em.

101
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:26,058
         - Oh. Oh, boy.

102
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,627
            Oh, boy.

103
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,362
            Oh, boy.

104
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:32,030
            Oh, boy.

105
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:33,532
            Oh, boy.

106
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:45,310
              - Oh.
              - No.

107
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:46,712
No!

108
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:47,946
             - Whoo!
  - It's getting real out here.

109
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:49,581
       - I almost had it!
             - Whoo!

110
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,093
         - Miley Cyrus!
  - That's right. Miley Cyrus!

111
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:05,130
    - You better get it right
          for all that.

112
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:07,332
- Yeah.

113
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:11,436
   So you each have one point,
       which is fantastic.

114
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:13,839
       I think next season
   we have to add more padding

115
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:17,008
       because we thought
  we had enough, but clearly--

116
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,276
     All right, here we go:

117
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:19,745
       Your brain must be
       spinning by now so

118
00:06:19,747 --> 00:06:21,279
   I'll give you an easy one.

119
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:24,015
   Say the last three letters
   of the alphabet backwards.

120
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,016
           Spin them.

121
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,908
       - Popped the ball.

122
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:50,942
            Z, Y, X.
         - That's right.

123
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:53,512
          -Oh, my god.
       - I have bad news.

124
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:55,013
 - Good job. Good job. Good job.
         - Are you good?

125
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,581
           - I'm good!
   My head is a little crazy!

126
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,716
        - Yeah, I've got
         the same thing.

127
00:06:57,718 --> 00:06:59,117
             - Yeah!
   - You can just set it down.

128
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,485
        - This is popped.
    - That-- It popped? Okay.

129
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:02,521
             - Yeah.
     - All right, you boys--

130
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:03,922
        That's all right.
             - Yeah.

131
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:08,393
   - We have plenty of those.

132
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:09,694
- I was so focused
on running out.

133
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:11,062
          - Bro, yeah.
      I did the same thing.

134
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:13,198
          - All right.

135
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,303
  Some of the popular hashtags
 this year were: LOL, BRB, TBT.

136
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:23,108
 What letters are on the number
  two button of a phone keypad?

137
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,109
           Spin them.

138
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:46,064
             - Aha!
             - Whoa!

139
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:50,502
     - That was very close.

140
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:51,837
- What is it?

141
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,271
- D, E, F.

142
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:54,706
              - No!

143
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,808
  - You have a chance to steal.
     Do you know what it is?

144
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,176
    - On a number two keypad?
             - Yeah.

145
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:01,213
      What are the letters
    on the number two keypad?

146
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:04,916
        - The letters on
      the number two, uh...

147
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,618
it is D--

148
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,720
        - It was A, B, C.

149
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:10,222
              - Aw.
         - Yep. I know.

150
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:11,289
      That's a tricky one.
       That's what we do.

151
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,290
             - Whew.
             - Yeah.

152
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:15,327
         - We're tricky.

153
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:16,561
           All right.

154
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,897
    If Rihanna rows her raft
     down a stream merrily,

155
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,699
        merrily, merrily,
        merrily, merrily,

156
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:24,135
 what does the itsy bitsy spider
            climb up?

157
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:25,136
           Spin them.

158
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:51,830
              - Oh.
   - He's got it. Alex has it.

159
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:05,243
- The itsy bitsy spider walks
up the water spout.

160
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:06,878
- That is correct. Yes!

161
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,947
- Down came the rain
and washed the spider out!

162
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:11,249
      - You are the winner!

163
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,022
- You are going on to play
Know or Go,

164
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:18,390
one step closer
to $100,000.

165
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:19,824
                         - Yeah!

166
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:21,860
- We'll be right back!

167
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,836
     <i> - Alex dashes his way</i>
    <i> to the top of Know or Go</i>

168
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:34,539
         <i> for the chance</i>
       <i> at some big money.</i>

169
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,875
    <i> Coming up, grab a seat.</i>

170
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:38,710
           - Oh, man!

171
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:40,979
       <i> - It's Blindfolded</i>
        <i> Musical Chairs.</i>

172
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:42,280
              - Oh.
  - Want to catch your breath?

173
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:43,415
            Too late.
             Dance.

174
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:45,317
          - Oh, great.
      <i> - And the classic...</i>

175
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:46,751
        - This red button
       is in front of me.

176
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:47,786
   I don't know what it does.

177
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:48,787
         <i> - Danger Word.</i>

178
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,192
        <i> And fall in love</i>

179
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:57,128
        <i> with the all-new</i>

180
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,396
         <i> Runaway Bride.</i>

181
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:15,714
     - You've probably heard
       of a messy divorce.

182
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:18,183
      Well, I've invented,
    for the first time ever,

183
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:19,250
        a messy wedding.

184
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:21,519
        It's time to play
         Runaway Bride.

185
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:44,442
         - Hit the road.
    I need three contestants

186
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:47,412
        to vow to love me
  no matter what I do to them.

187
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:49,014
       Who is it, tWitch?
          - I got you.

188
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:54,152
 Where are Leann Oliver, Felicia
   McGuire and Neandre Pesade?

189
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:11,936
      - Hi! How's it going?
     - Hi. Good to meet you.

190
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:13,672
         - Who are you?
        - Hi, I'm Leann.

191
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:18,877
   I'm from Goodyear, Arizona,
  and I'm a photographer. Whoo!

192
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,412
           - You are?
         - I'm Neandre.

193
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:22,180
     I'm from Dallas, Texas,
  and I started a organization

194
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,549
    that helps black boys get
 access to free business attire.

195
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:27,752
             - Whoo!
   - Fantastic. Good for you.

196
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:29,487
             - Yes.
         - And you are?

197
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:31,089
   - Hi, I'm Felicia McGuire.
  I'm from Birmingham, Alabama,

198
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:32,957
         and I'm a field
     applications engineer.

199
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,693
          - All right.
             - Whoo!

200
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:36,127
- All of those are good things.

201
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,495
While we turn you
into blushing brides,

202
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:39,097
here's how you play this game.

203
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:42,801
   <i> Cold feet are going to be</i>

204
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:44,402
           <i> the least</i>
   <i> of these brides' worries.</i>

205
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:47,105
   <i> In this game, three brides</i>
 <i> will sprint towards the altar</i>

206
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:48,773
        <i> on a treadmill.</i>

207
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:51,076
   <i> I'll launch slices of cake</i>
          <i> into the air</i>

208
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:53,411
      <i> and then the brides</i>
   <i> will fight to catch them.</i>

209
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:56,347
   <i> But beware. Not everything</i>
     <i> I launch will be cake,</i>

210
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,283
         <i> and that stuff</i>
       <i> is worthless, huh?</i>

211
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:00,618
    <i> The first bride to catch</i>
      <i> three pieces of cake</i>

212
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:04,089
  <i> and place them on their hope</i>
    <i> chest will win my heart,</i>

213
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:05,890
      <i> and they'll move on</i>
         <i> to Know or Go.</i>

214
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:13,198
              - Oh.
        You're too cute.

215
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,467
          - I love it!
     - Beautiful. Beautiful.

216
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:17,535
           All right.
  I got you some wedding gifts.

217
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:19,504
       One of them is this
   industrial-sized treadmill.

218
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:21,906
         Let's get that
       started right now.

219
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,341
              Okay.

220
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:24,843
          - Oh, my god.
   - That's going pretty fast.

221
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,511
         - This is fast!

222
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:30,949
  - The other gifts will appear
 being launched from over here.

223
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:32,350
  Brides, pull up your garters

224
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:36,521
         and don't trip
        over your trains.

225
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:43,228
       Ready, set, and...

226
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,229
               go.

227
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:49,167
             - Whoa.

228
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:51,703
             - Whoo!

229
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:57,776
           - Oh, god.

230
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:08,453
                   - Oh, my god.

231
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:09,754
                             No.

232
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:15,293
- Whoo!

233
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:08,513
             - Whoo!

234
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:19,490
              - Oh!

235
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:38,142
              Whoo!

236
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:00,999
            - Leann.
              - Hi.

237
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:03,034
       - That was a fight.
             - Yeah.

238
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:04,636
- That was a fight over
a piece of cake.

239
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:05,803
          - Whoo! Yes.
         - Good for you.

240
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:07,205
I am going to send you
on a honeymoon

241
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:08,373
to the top of Know or Go,

242
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,608
one step closer
to the $100,000.

243
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:11,609
We'll be back.

244
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:16,881
      - That was hilarious.
      - Thank you so much!

245
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:18,316
- You're welcome!
I'll see you later!

246
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:33,398
          - Thank you.

247
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:37,035
     It's more than enough,
    and it's almost too much.

248
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:40,338
  The game is more moving than
  the episode of "This is Us."

249
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,907
        It's time to play
   Blindfolded Musical Chairs.

250
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:50,214
             - Yeah!

251
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:55,853
          - All right.

252
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:57,221
 Let's see who is going to play
        this crazy game.

253
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:58,756
        Who are you, sir?

254
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:00,658
    - My name is Kelton Hunt.
   I'm from St. George, Utah,

255
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,827
    and I'm a premed student
   at Dixie State University.

256
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:06,364
          - Wonderful.

257
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:07,899
          And you are?
        - I'm Petey Yang.

258
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:10,835
   I'm from Hoschton, Georgia,
    and I'm a makeup artist.

259
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:14,272
 - Wonderful, Petey. All right.
          And you are?

260
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:15,573
      - I am Madison Colbo.

261
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,175
      I'm from Hattiesburg,
          Mississippi,

262
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:19,944
 and I'm a skin-care consultant
      who can also beatbox.

263
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:25,149
   - Oh, wow. And who are you?
      - I am Tamara Canara.

264
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,985
     I'm from Philadelphia,
          Pennsylvania,

265
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:31,522
  and I am a premium processer,
  aka I just process payments.

266
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:34,058
          - All right.
       - Yes. We love it.

267
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,561
     - All right. This game
   is so much fun and so easy.

268
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:37,762
      Here's how you play.

269
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:40,865
       <i> - Four contestants</i>
      <i> will be blindfolded.</i>

270
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:43,301
     <i> When I stop the music,</i>
  <i> they'll race to find a seat.</i>

271
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:46,237
     <i> Whoever can't find one</i>
      <i> will be eliminated.</i>

272
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:48,172
    <i> We'll play three rounds,</i>
      <i> and the final player</i>

273
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:52,310
      <i> in the game will win</i>
   <i> and advance to Know or Go.</i>

274
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:59,117
 Okay, give you your blindfolds,

275
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:01,352
        and the beginning
        of our enjoyment.

276
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,720
           - Oh, god.

277
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:05,823
 - Everyone has a different way
           to do this.

278
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:08,593
  All right, let the music play
       and begin dancing.

279
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,447
      - Oh, and they really
         hit the ground.

280
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:30,615
              Okay.
             - Whoo!

281
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:32,917
     - They are in a hurry.

282
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:36,187
       They are in a hurry
          to find this.

283
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:39,424
              Okay.

284
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:42,293
             - Whoa!

285
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:45,663
         - Kelton's on!

286
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:47,398
             - Whoo!

287
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,467
            - Oh, no!
            - Sorry!

288
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:51,669
           - Oh, man.

289
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:56,874
          - All right.

290
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:58,342
             - Whoo.

291
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:00,611
           - Oh, man.

292
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:02,346
              - Oh.
             - Whoa.

293
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:10,621
              - No.
     So close, and yet, no--

294
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:12,757
              - Ah!
          I'm so tired.

295
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,025
 - Petey is putting his head up

296
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:16,227
      like a little turtle
         out of a pond.

297
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:17,595
 Looking around like that helps.

298
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,330
     Oh, on to the spinning
         wheel of death.

299
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:21,599
             - Whoo!

300
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,334
       - Now he's crawling
          like a snake.

301
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,044
- Yeah!

302
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:34,779
        - Madison got it!
              Okay.

303
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,215
             - Oop!
      - No, that was a leg.

304
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:44,388
    - Oh, my god! Oh, my god.

305
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,723
           Oh, my god.

306
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,828
             - Whoo!
          - Oh, my god.

307
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,698
I'm so sorry.

308
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,234
   Petey, did-- I don't know.
 I didn't mean to hit that one,

309
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:58,603
  and somehow it surprised you,
            I'm sure.

310
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:00,204
      It surprised me too.
          - It's okay.

311
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:04,709
             - Okay.
           All right.

312
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:07,445
   And, Kelton, that was some
   excellent ballroom dancing.

313
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:08,646
     Good use of the space.

314
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,248
             - Yeah.
          - All right.

315
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,216
             Ready?
             Dance.

316
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:49,253
           - Oh! Ooh!
        - Okay. That's--

317
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:53,191
  Have to put an adult warning
  on this show because of that.

318
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:56,060
   All right. Oh, wow, Petey,
      that quite something.

319
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:57,762
          - Thank you.
        - Yeah, it's like

320
00:19:57,764 --> 00:20:01,132
   a performance art, almost.
           Wonderful.

321
00:20:01,134 --> 00:20:03,501
     - I'm going to need to
       work on my cardio.

322
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:05,436
             - Okay.
      The rolling is good.

323
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:06,437
            It helps.

324
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:10,308
              Okay.

325
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:17,348
     Someone was very close!

326
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:21,185
      No, you passed it up!

327
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:29,260
             - Whoo!
        - Kelton got it!

328
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:32,330
              Okay.

329
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:33,331
           Let's see.

330
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,366
     There's one stool left!

331
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,274
               Oh.

332
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:55,586
          - Oh, Petey.

333
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,655
             - Yes!

334
00:20:57,657 --> 00:20:59,690
 - Oh, Petey, I'm going to miss
    your dancing. That was--

335
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:01,259
   You were so close, and then
     you passed it right by.

336
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:02,960
  - Thank you. Oh, well that--
       - That's the thing.

337
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:05,363
 Okay, now, one of you is going
      to go play Know or Go

338
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:07,898
 because there's two of you left
         and one stool.

339
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,867
  All right, you want to catch
          your breath?

340
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:11,235
            Too late.
             Dance.

341
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:23,914
          - Spicy hot.

342
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:35,493
             - Whoa.

343
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:42,266
              Okay.
       Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

344
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:53,010
- Whoo!

345
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:02,820
             - Whoo.
              Yeah!

346
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:04,922
          - Hi, Kelton.
       - Hey, how are you?

347
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:06,524
       - That's fantastic.
             - Whoo!

348
00:22:06,526 --> 00:22:08,626
   - You're going to be up there
             playing Know or Go,

349
00:22:08,628 --> 00:22:10,628
    one step closer to $100,000.

350
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,663
             - Whoo!
     - We'll be right back.

351
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,101
             - Whoo!
   - Yes! That was excellent.

 <i> - Kelton secures the best seat</i>
   <i> in the house on Know or Go</i>

354

   - I know you want to do it.

           - Go ahead.

            - Really?

360
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,133
      - Welcome back to my
        "Game of Games."

361
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:50,668
     It's important to think
        before you speak,

362
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:53,371
 especially with this next game
     because one wrong word

363
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:54,672
         and you will be
        left speechless.

364
00:22:54,674 --> 00:22:57,475
        It's time to play
          Danger Word.

365
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,183
    <i> ♪ When you hear the call</i>

366
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:10,388
      - All right. tWitch,

367
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,456
      who is going to step
      into the danger zone?

368
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:13,891
  - All right. Where are Eddie
        and Audrey Later,

369
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:14,959
      and Paige Greighton,
          Jenna Massai?

370
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:26,070
                   - Oh, my god!

371
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:33,377
- , Ellen.

372
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:36,881
      - All right, you are?
          - I'm Jenna.

373
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:38,349
          - Hi, Jenna.
        - And I'm Paige.

374
00:23:38,351 --> 00:23:39,483
             - And--

375
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:40,851
          - And what's
     the relationship here?

376
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:42,119
      - We're best friends.
             - Okay.

377
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:43,354
- And we're both
dental hygienists,

378
00:23:43,356 --> 00:23:45,289
and this is a dream come true!
Whoo!

379
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,926
       - That's wonderful.
          And you are?

380
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:52,763
    - I'm Audrey, and this is
   my husband of 42 years, Ed.

381
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:53,998
          - I'm Eddie.
           - Oh, wow.

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,199
            - Eddie.
             - Whoo.

383
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:56,801
           - 42 years.

384
00:23:56,803 --> 00:23:59,069
 They have a connection that is
    going to be tough to beat

385
00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:00,471
  because when you're together

386
00:24:00,473 --> 00:24:03,941
    that long, you know what
     you're thinking, right?

387
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:07,011
           - Usually.
      - Yeah. Good and bad.

388
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:08,579
     - Good and bad, right.
          - All right.

    and you two are going to
  stay here with me, all right?

391
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:16,253
             - Yeah.
             - Whoo!

392
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:18,155
    - See what just happened?
      They just high-fived.

393
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:19,356
       She just left you.

394
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:21,859
            - I know!
        - I'm so excited.

395
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:24,462
            - I know.
 Here's how you play this game.

396
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,065
     <i> The object of the game</i>
     <i> is to get your partner</i>

397
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:31,435
    <i> to guess the winner word</i>
   <i> using only one-word clues.</i>

398
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:33,938
      <i> However, if they say</i>
    <i> the danger word instead,</i>

399
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,806
        <i> I'll blast them.</i>

400
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,508
  <i> Take too long, get blasted.</i>

401
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,510
   <i> Illegal clue, get blasted.</i>

402
00:24:39,512 --> 00:24:40,845
   <i> If the other team guesses</i>
       <i> the winning word,</i>

403
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:43,047
 <i> that's right, you get blasted.</i>

404
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:45,382
          <i> Three blasts</i>
     <i> and the game is over.</i>

405
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:46,684
     <i> Then the winning team</i>

406
00:24:46,686 --> 00:24:49,820
    <i> will send one player on</i>
         <i> to Know or Go.</i>

407
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,088
Okeydokey.

408
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,823
           All right.

409
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:56,293
  And I'm going to apologize in
  advance for whatever happens.

410
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:58,395
   All right, here's my friend
         Martha Stewart

411
00:24:58,397 --> 00:25:02,099
   to tell the people at home
    what the danger word is.

412
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:05,069
  - The winning word is "sofa."

413
00:25:05,071 --> 00:25:08,639
   The danger word is "couch."

414
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:12,510
          - All righty.

415
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:14,979
      We're going to start
        with you, Jenna.

416
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:17,748
            - Chair.
             - Sit.

417
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:24,788
           - Recliner.
             - Easy.

418
00:25:29,562 --> 00:25:31,128
              - TV.
           - La-Z-Boy.

419
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,563
- God, you really--

420
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:35,132
       Your face was like,
          "I got this,"

421
00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:38,402
     and that is not right.
              Okay.

422
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:40,437
         - Wrap-around.
            - Couch.

423
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:44,208
   - That is the danger word.
             Oh, no.

424
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,310
  Unfortunately this red button
         is front of me.

425
00:25:46,312 --> 00:25:47,711
   I don't know what it does.

426
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:52,049
        I'm just going to
      push it to see, okay?

427
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,527
              - Oh!

428
00:26:09,435 --> 00:26:11,869
    - Oh, thank you so much.
          - All right.

429
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:13,070
      - That was beautiful.

430
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,605
    - Audrey really feels bad
            for you.

431
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:16,106
- Yeah, it's killing me..

432
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:18,909
  - What does that taste like?
           - Ketchup?

433
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:21,412
    - No, you're higher class
  than that: It's SpaghettiOs.

434
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:23,514
         - SpaghettiOs!

435
00:26:23,516 --> 00:26:25,215
             - Yeah.

436
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:29,386
      - All right, here is
 Steph Curry with our next word.

437
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:32,256
       - The winning word
          is "dribble."

438
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:35,159
  The danger word is "bounce."

439
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:41,699
   - All right, so we move on
      to Audrey and Eddie.

440
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:45,769
             - Bib.
            - Napkin?

441
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:51,308
          - Basketball.
            - Jersey?

442
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:55,913
             - Baby.
             - Food.

443
00:26:59,552 --> 00:27:02,586
  - I'll let you push when we--
          - Oh, really?

444
00:27:02,588 --> 00:27:03,954
     - I'll let you push it.
      - It's worth losing.

445
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:06,557
          - All right.
             - Spit.

446
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,558
             - Rag.

447
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:13,364
                         - Neck.

448
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,899
           - Dribble.
             - Yes!

449
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:21,105
       - Yeah! Yeah! Whoo!

450
00:27:21,107 --> 00:27:22,940
   - Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

451
00:27:22,942 --> 00:27:25,075
          - Basketball!
        Yeah, of course!

452
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:26,410
     - Again, I have no idea
    what's going to come out

453
00:27:26,412 --> 00:27:27,878
       because it's always
      something different.

454
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,448
         Let's just see.

455
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,287
            - Oh, no!

456
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:46,163
  - Oh, I think it's chocolate.
       - It is, chocolate.

457
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:47,498
All right.

458
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,968
        Melissa McCarthy,
     tell us our next word.

459
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:54,772
       - The winning word
        is "celebration."

460
00:27:54,774 --> 00:27:56,740
   The danger word is "party."

461
00:28:00,613 --> 00:28:03,580
       - All right, Jenna.

462
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:06,383
            - Cheers.
     - "Cheers." Champagne.

463
00:28:08,621 --> 00:28:11,889
           - Festive.

464
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:13,657
            - Party.

465
00:28:16,796 --> 00:28:19,596
   - Now, to be fair, Audrey--
             - What?

466
00:28:19,598 --> 00:28:20,698
 - Anniversaries, celebrations,
       you know, festive--

467
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,732
        - Oh, you thought
      I should have said--

468
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:22,933
             - Yeah.

469
00:28:22,935 --> 00:28:24,468
- Should have said.

470
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,736
 - I'm on his side on this one.
          I'm so sorry.

471
00:28:25,738 --> 00:28:26,737
          - Thank you.
 - But I know you want to do it.

472
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:27,738
                       - So bad.

473
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,806
           - Go ahead.
            - Really?

474
00:28:28,808 --> 00:28:31,742
             - Yeah.

475
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:35,012
     - Nothing else matters.

476
00:28:35,014 --> 00:28:36,447
          - Yeah, yeah.

477
00:28:42,188 --> 00:28:45,322
                    - Thank you.
                      Thank you.

478
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:46,824
                      Thank you.

479
00:28:46,826 --> 00:28:48,992
          - All right.
          - Oh, Eddie.

480
00:28:48,994 --> 00:28:51,528
         - See, it's a--
            - Oh! Oh!

481
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:55,866
           - It's a--

482
00:28:55,868 --> 00:28:57,134
        She doesn't even
       care she's losing!

483
00:28:57,136 --> 00:29:00,037
 - This is the best thing ever!
         - Oh, my gosh.

484
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,805
    - Eddie, there's $100,000
            at stake,

485
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:03,140
     and all she cares about

486
00:29:03,142 --> 00:29:05,409
     is hitting that button
        and making you--

487
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:07,444
       - Story of my time.
          - All right.

488
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:10,447
         Kenan Thompson,
    our danger word, please.

489
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:15,152
 - The winning word is "booty,"
           of course.

490
00:29:15,154 --> 00:29:16,386
             Booty.

491
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:19,056
   The danger word is "butt."

492
00:29:19,058 --> 00:29:21,558
   Stay away from them butts.

493
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,993
        You hear me kids?

494
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:25,763
          - All right.
     We are back to Audrey.

495
00:29:25,765 --> 00:29:27,397
         This is tricky.

496
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:29,500
            - Behind.

497
00:29:29,502 --> 00:29:30,667
             - Back.

498
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:36,840
             - Okay.
             - Sit.

499
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:40,144
             - Butt.

500
00:29:40,146 --> 00:29:41,979
             - Whoo!

501
00:29:41,981 --> 00:29:43,313
          - I'm sorry.
              - Oh.

502
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:45,249
        - Then it's even,

503
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:49,419
   which is exciting because--

504
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:51,822
Yeah. All right.

505
00:29:51,824 --> 00:29:53,724
          There you go.

506
00:29:53,726 --> 00:29:55,626
     - Oh, I'm sorry, Paige.

507
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:07,070
  - All right, here's Hoda Kotb
       with our next word.

508
00:30:07,072 --> 00:30:10,174
  - The winning word is "sea."

509
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:14,011
   The danger word is "ocean."

510
00:30:14,013 --> 00:30:15,179
       Back to you, Ellen.

511
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:23,554
       - All right, Jenna.
            - Otter.

512
00:30:23,556 --> 00:30:24,888
             - Sea.
             - Yes!

513
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:31,795
           - Oh, boy,
     that is really a shame.

514
00:30:31,797 --> 00:30:36,667
  And, you know what, you might
    as well do the final one.

515
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:38,936
        Go ahead, please.
           All right.

516
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:42,539
              - Oh.

517
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:45,642
       - You were accurate
         with that one.

518
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:50,247
          - All right.
      You'll go on to play

519
00:30:50,249 --> 00:30:51,415
          Know or Go...
          - Yes! Whoo!

520
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:52,883
         - For a chance
        to win $100,000!

521
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:54,351
      We'll be right back!

522
00:30:58,257 --> 00:31:00,524
             - Whoo!

523
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:02,492
           <i> - So Jenna</i>
     <i> narrowly makes her way</i>

524
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:04,228
   <i> to the top of Know or Go,</i>

525
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:06,730
         <i> for $100,000.</i>

526
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:09,633
   <i> Up next you either know...</i>

527
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:10,834
           - Oh, god!
            <i> - Or...</i>

528
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:15,906
             - Whoa!
           <i> - You go!</i>

529
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:20,377
- Oh.

530
00:31:31,991 --> 00:31:34,324
     - It's important to use
   your head in this next game

531
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:36,660
  because if you don't, you're
 going to land on your keister.

532
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:38,161
     Let's play Know or Go.

533
00:31:47,473 --> 00:31:49,206
          - I'm sorry.

534
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:50,274
       I'm still thinking
   about that word, "keister."

535
00:31:50,276 --> 00:31:53,977
   It's a weird word. Keister.

536
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:56,713
         Anyway, tWitch,
     bring out our players!

537
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:18,235
       - Hello, you guys!

538
00:32:18,237 --> 00:32:20,003
      Kelton, you couldn't
 see yourself ballroom dancing,

539
00:32:20,005 --> 00:32:21,738
       and that's probably
          a good thing.

540
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,408
   Jenna, your best friend got
  covered with chocolate sauce

541
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:27,277
 while you made a clean getaway
         in Danger Word.

542
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,713
  Leann, it was a little fight
         to the finish,

543
00:32:29,715 --> 00:32:32,482
     but you came out on top
        in Runaway Bride,

544
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:35,886
       and, finally, Alex,
       you broke our ball

545
00:32:35,888 --> 00:32:38,422
   and almost a whole lot more
         on Dizzy Dash.

546
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,161
   The pressure is on because
 only one of you is going to be

547
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:47,130
        standing up there
 to go on to play for $100,000.

548
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,202
      - The game is simple:

549
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:53,770
      I am going to ask you
           a question.

550
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:55,072
     If you know, you stay.

551
00:32:55,074 --> 00:32:58,842
      If you don't, you go.
     Let's play Know or Go.

552
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:10,787
          - All right.
          - All right.

553
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:13,790
  Kelton, they say good things
         come in pairs.

554
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:14,891
       Which pair of twins

555
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:20,664
     played Michelle Tanner
        on "Full House."

556
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:23,000
     - Mary-Kate and Ashley!
         - That's right!

557
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:28,739
          - All right.
   Jenna, I got a feeling that

558
00:33:28,741 --> 00:33:31,341
 you're either going to get this
     feeling right or wrong.

559
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,744
        - Oh, no, Ellen.
  - Who sang "I Gotta Feeling"?

560
00:33:33,746 --> 00:33:34,911
      - "I Gotta Feeling."

561
00:33:36,115 --> 00:33:38,148
- Yep. Yep.

562
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:42,486
        - Yep. Yep. Yep.
       - Black Eyed Peas!

563
00:33:42,488 --> 00:33:46,023
- Yes!

564
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:49,359
 - Leann, ghosting someone means
     you end a relationship

565
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:50,794
   by stopping communication.

566
00:33:50,796 --> 00:33:54,831
         Who is known as
      "the Friendly Ghost"?

567
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:59,169
     - "The Friendly Ghost"
 is "Casper the Friendly Ghost"!

568
00:33:59,171 --> 00:34:00,637
       - That is correct.

569
00:34:03,342 --> 00:34:07,844
   - Alex, Sir Mix-a-lot sang,
  "My anaconda don't want none

570
00:34:07,846 --> 00:34:09,513
   unless you got buns, hon."

571
00:34:09,515 --> 00:34:14,384
   What's the name of the most
  popular cinnamon roll chain?

572
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:15,719
 - The name of the most popular

573
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:17,354
       cinnamon roll chain
       is called Cinnabon.

574
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:18,855
         - That's right!

575
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:22,492
             - Yes.
          - All righty.

   what former "Suits" actress

577
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:29,066
   gave birth to a royal baby?

578
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:35,038
       - I don't even know
       if I have a guess!

579
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,540
         - Take a guess.

580
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:38,708
      - Jennifer Lawrence!
              - No!

581
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,943
          - All right.

582
00:34:39,945 --> 00:34:42,079
          Meghan Markle
   is married to Prince Harry.

583
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:43,246
            - Oh, no!
     Please, please, please!

584
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,514
          - Yeah. Yeah.
              - Oh.

585
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:45,849
I want to see my family.

586
00:34:45,851 --> 00:34:50,187
    - Oh, they're down here.
          Come on down.

587
00:34:50,189 --> 00:34:51,588
          - Oh, my god!
          - Oh, my god!

588
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,589
       - Oh, that's quick!

589
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:55,125
       That's right away!

590
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:05,569
              - Oh!

591
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:06,970
    - That's so sweet of me!

592
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:08,472
   He wanted to see his family
     and I brought him down.

593
00:35:08,474 --> 00:35:10,373
             Jenna.

594
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:11,975
          - Hi, Ellen.
              - Hi.

595
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:14,444
 It might be time for you to go
      if you can't tell me

596
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:17,581
         what's the name
 of the famous clock in London?

597
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:20,383
  - The famous clock in London
           is Big Ben!

598
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:21,885
       - That is correct!

599
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:25,455
   - Leann, they say breakfast

600
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:27,023
           is the most
   important meal of the day.

601
00:35:27,025 --> 00:35:28,658
     I say it's happy hour.

602
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:33,864
     What cereal's slogan is
  "The breakfast of champions"?

603
00:35:33,866 --> 00:35:35,966
   - "Breakfast of champions."

604
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:41,538
       I'm going to say...

605
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,140
         Frosted Flakes.

606
00:35:45,611 --> 00:35:47,377
        - It's Wheaties.
             - Okay!

607
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:49,813
  - Yeah, that's the breakfast
          of champions.

608
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:51,314
            - Oh, my!

609
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,818
  - But Tony the Tiger thought
  that that was a great answer.

610
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,786
         - Right. Right.
             - Okay.

611
00:35:56,788 --> 00:35:58,688
  Oh, you're making your bonnet
    and you're getting ready?

612
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,557
- It's so pretty,.
 - Okay, that's good because

613
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:01,992
             that'll
    be cute on the way down.

614
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:03,326
             - Yeah.
            - I know.

615
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,461
       - All right. Ready?
       - Thank you, Ellen!

616
00:36:04,463 --> 00:36:06,129
            - Ready?
      - No, I'm not ready!

617
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:07,497
      I'm not ready, Ellen!
         I'm not ready!

618
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:08,698
I'm not ready, Ellen!

619
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,000
- I'm not ready!

620
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:11,601
- Okay, now do it.

621
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:12,602
           - Oh, god.

622
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:14,070
             - Whoa!

623
00:36:14,072 --> 00:36:15,205
            - Ellen!

624
00:36:15,207 --> 00:36:16,706
, Ellen.

625
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:18,275
             - Hup!
             Pshhoo!

626
00:36:18,277 --> 00:36:19,876
Dong!

627
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:20,977
      - I love you, Ellen.

628
00:36:20,979 --> 00:36:23,046
              - Oh.
      - I do, I love you--

629
00:36:23,048 --> 00:36:24,481
- Oh.

630
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:26,283
             - Whoa.

631
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:34,691
              - Oh!

632
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,393
           - It's far!
           - It's far!

633
00:36:36,395 --> 00:36:38,929
         It's very far,
  and it goes beyond that, too.

634
00:36:38,931 --> 00:36:43,233
   It goes out, and then down
    a sewer line, and it's--

635
00:36:43,235 --> 00:36:48,738
     Okay, this is exciting.
      This is Sudden Drop.

636
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:52,275
If you get an answer wrong,

637
00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:53,777
         it doesn't mean
     that the game is over,

638
00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:56,479
   it means that your opponent
     has a chance to steal.

639
00:36:56,481 --> 00:36:58,315
 If they get it right, you drop.

640
00:36:58,317 --> 00:37:00,350
       If not, we go back
     to the questions again.

641
00:37:00,352 --> 00:37:02,419
     It comes down to this,
      and it's so exciting,

642
00:37:02,421 --> 00:37:04,554
        especially for my
      stage manager, Linda,

643
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,823
    because she's so excited
      she's crawling around

644
00:37:06,825 --> 00:37:08,258
     on her hands and knees.

645
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,559
      And-- Oh, I'm sorry,
       she lost a contact.

646
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,962
      That's what's-- Okay.

647
00:37:11,964 --> 00:37:15,865
Alex, I feel like
  we're really in sync.

648
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:18,034
   What former member of NSYNC

649
00:37:18,036 --> 00:37:21,771
           is married
        to Jessica Biel?

650
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:23,807
            - NSYNC.

651
00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:26,843
              Um...

652
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:28,078
         Oh, it's the blond guy.

653
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,580
The frosted tips.

654
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,082
       Justin Timberlake!
       Justin Timberlake!

655
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:33,250
           - Yes, yes.
      - Justin Timberlake!

656
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:34,417
- Yes!

657
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:38,088
           - Yes! Oh.
             - Okay.

658
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,956
 Justin is going to be so happy

659
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:41,358
          you remember
       those frosted tips.

660
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,560
        - Sorry, Justin.
   - He's going to be watching

661
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:46,129
          that, going,
  "I'll never live that down."

662
00:37:46,131 --> 00:37:47,497
    It was the '90s, Justin.

663
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:48,999
             - Yeah.
  - It's okay. Don't feel bad.

664
00:37:49,001 --> 00:37:52,302
        All right, Jenna.
   Jenna, there's not question

665
00:37:52,304 --> 00:37:54,070
         that this game
        is above the law.

666
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:57,307
   What does "FBI" stand for?

667
00:38:01,146 --> 00:38:07,050
        Federal Business
           Insurance?

668
00:38:07,052 --> 00:38:09,152
              Ooh!

669
00:38:09,154 --> 00:38:10,854
  - Okay, that is not correct.

670
00:38:10,856 --> 00:38:12,789
        Alex, do you know
       what it stands for?

671
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,658
      - It's Federal Bureau
        of Investigation!

672
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,859
- That's right!

673
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:21,231
- Yeah!
-   Yeah,.

674
00:38:21,233 --> 00:38:23,400
          I'm so sorry!
          I'm so sorry!

675
00:38:23,402 --> 00:38:26,870
        - I am so sorry.
 Jenna, that's a shame, though.

676
00:38:26,872 --> 00:38:28,705
  They do not provide insurance
           to people.

677
00:38:28,707 --> 00:38:30,674
 - No they don't! No they don't!
            - No, no.

678
00:38:30,676 --> 00:38:33,710
    You're going to go down,
  and it's going to be so fun.

679
00:38:33,712 --> 00:38:34,811
       Look forward to it!

680
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:36,713
       You have no choice!
         Be so excited!

681
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:38,348
    - Oh, Ellen, I love you!
           - Just say,

682
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,883
      "Ellen, I can't wait
       to go down there!"

683
00:38:39,885 --> 00:38:41,384
- No, no, no, I'm not excited!

684
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:43,019
             - No--
      - No, no, no, no, no!

685
00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:44,854
 - No, say it, "I can't wait to
     go down there, Ellen!"

686
00:38:44,856 --> 00:38:48,024
      - Ellen, I can't wait
        to go down there!

687
00:38:57,069 --> 00:38:59,235
             - Whoo!
              Yeah!

688
00:38:59,237 --> 00:39:00,737
      - You're the winner!

689
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:02,739
          You're going
       to play Hot Hands!

690
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:05,041
        - Ellen, please.
         - Come on down!

691
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:06,376
          - No, no, no!

692
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:10,046
      - Oh, we'll be back.

693
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:25,662
                   - All righty.
     Well, we're back with Alex,

694
00:39:25,664 --> 00:39:27,063
                and I don't want
                to freak you out

695
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:30,700
         but we're one step away
         from $100,000 possibly.

696
00:39:33,105 --> 00:39:35,739
       - Tell me what that money
        would mean to you, Alex.

697
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:37,440
- Well, it'd mean
the world to me.

698
00:39:37,442 --> 00:39:39,409
      I'm first generation
   in this country, actually.

699
00:39:39,411 --> 00:39:41,611
    My family are immigrants
    and they won green cards

700
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:43,880
to get here,
so they kind of scrapped

701
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:46,516
and did whatever they could to
get to where we are now,

702
00:39:46,518 --> 00:39:47,917
    so I'd like to help them

703
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:49,619
    with whatever is going on
  in their financial situation.

704
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:50,787
                 - Good for you.

705
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:52,355
- Yeah.

706
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:54,591
  - Who's here cheering you on?
    - My mom is right there.

707
00:39:54,593 --> 00:39:58,828
          - All right.
          Hi, Mama. Hi.

708
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:00,363
           All right, you played
         the app before, I hope?

709
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:01,865
    - Yeah, I binged it hard.
          - Okay, good.

710
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:03,032
     - It's super addicting.
          - Well, yeah.

711
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:04,234
                It is addicting,
                but it's so fun.

712
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:06,069
             - Yeah.
  - And when you play the app,

713
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:07,170
  the more you play the app, the
    better you are in this game.

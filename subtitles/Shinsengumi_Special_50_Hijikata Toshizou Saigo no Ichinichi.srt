1
00:00:03,067 --> 00:00:04,904
Hakodate, Goryokaku.

2
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:08,134
The last stronghold of the Shogunate army.

3
00:00:09,162 --> 00:00:14,031
In October 1868, Tokugawa supporters landed in Ezo,

4
00:00:14,032 --> 00:00:20,027
drove the forces of the new government of Fort Goryokaku and installed in Ezo, their rules.

5
00:00:20,683 --> 00:00:26,912
Wanting to create a state independent of Japan, they chose Enomoto Takeaki as their President,

6
00:00:26,913 --> 00:00:33,202
Ootori of Keisuke Minister of war, and Hijikata Toshizo - his assistant.

7
00:00:33,203 --> 00:00:36,596
However, the new government soon launched a counter-offensive,

8
00:00:36,697 --> 00:00:40,867
and by may 1869 the city of Hakodate and the surrounding area of Gorekaku

9
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:44,867
remained the last stronghold of people who remained loyal to the shogun.

10
00:00:53,808 --> 00:00:58,815
May 1969 (second year of the Meiji era)

11
00:01:00,491 --> 00:01:04,959
Of Ezo (Hokkaido), Nanahara

12
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:18,856
A Member Of The Shinsengumi
Shimada Kai

13
00:01:22,258 --> 00:01:23,574
Soma Kazue

14
00:01:23,582 --> 00:01:25,141
That's right, that's the tent over there.

15
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,671
Move!

16
00:01:31,448 --> 00:01:33,291
Well. Nominate.

17
00:01:33,292 --> 00:01:34,292
Are you sure it's time?

18
00:01:34,293 --> 00:01:37,005
We can't wait any longer. We must attack on our own.

19
00:01:50,966 --> 00:01:53,472
What is it?..

20
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,883
The Shinsengumi?..

21
00:02:09,006 --> 00:02:10,321
Hijikata-San!

22
00:02:11,462 --> 00:02:12,494
Tired of waiting?

23
00:02:16,555 --> 00:02:17,922
You're late!

24
00:02:17,923 --> 00:02:21,466
That's enough. This isn't the only place to watch, you know.

25
00:02:21,467 --> 00:02:23,632
Hijikata-San is the commander, so be respectful.

26
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:24,594
Yeah, you're climbing higher.

27
00:02:24,695 --> 00:02:25,891
Enough, enough...

28
00:02:25,892 --> 00:02:28,282
In the old days, in Kyoto, Hijikata-San was not so arrogant.

29
00:02:28,283 --> 00:02:30,408
He's always been on an equal footing with us, hasn't he, Ozeki?

30
00:02:30,408 --> 00:02:33,289
I was just a little late! And you are immediately dissatisfied!

31
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,554
Don't forget, we're still in ambush...

32
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:36,766
Where is their wagon train?

33
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:38,046
Yonder.

34
00:02:42,285 --> 00:02:43,634
Well... Go ahead!

35
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:45,970
Ozeki!

36
00:02:46,071 --> 00:02:46,661
Yes, Yes!

37
00:02:46,962 --> 00:02:49,587
Ozeki Of Masajiro

38
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,166
Go ahead!

39
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:19,403
Dorama " Shinsengumi!"
Bonus 50th episode

40
00:03:22,008 --> 00:03:28,343
Last day Of Hijikata Toshizo

41
00:04:07,003 --> 00:04:09,466
Everyone is already assembled, it's time to go out.

42
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,367
Don't rush it.

43
00:04:12,713 --> 00:04:17,545
Enomoto-San, the war is entering a crucial phase.

44
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:23,032
Of course, a real soldier must be careful, but to such trifles...

45
00:04:23,407 --> 00:04:25,954
But I'm the head of the army.

46
00:04:26,155 --> 00:04:29,192
Are you saying that I can go out to my subordinates in an inappropriate way?

47
00:04:30,891 --> 00:04:37,686
I want to demonstrate how great European soldiers can be... even in war.

48
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:40,956
Well, let's go.

49
00:04:48,114 --> 00:04:54,627
Sit, sit...

50
00:05:05,935 --> 00:05:06,972
Move.

51
00:05:18,842 --> 00:05:20,109
We're back!

52
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,610
Hakodate, the Shinsengumi camp

53
00:05:25,768 --> 00:05:29,013
Hush! Hijikata-San is about to make a speech.

54
00:05:29,314 --> 00:05:35,242
Guys, you showed the enemy your fighting spirit! I'm happy with you.

55
00:05:35,905 --> 00:05:42,352
We were able to prove to the Satsuma and Choshu clans that loyal Tokugawa vassals fight better than they do!

56
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:47,603
Our victory should be noted.

57
00:05:47,804 --> 00:05:53,273
After the battle, the soldiers must rest, so now we will drink sake!

58
00:05:56,055 --> 00:06:02,508
To be honest, I can't guarantee its quality - it was repulsed from the enemy.

59
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:11,438
Now there is a war, and you need to be prepared for everything, so you should not drink too much.

60
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,214
Let us drink to our winning the Cup! Soma, pour.

61
00:06:16,715 --> 00:06:20,606
Everyone takes the cups - and in the queue!

62
00:06:20,607 --> 00:06:24,675
We promise not to drink too much!

63
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:28,926
Can I get in line again?

64
00:06:30,175 --> 00:06:32,683
Hijikata-San is much better with people than before.

65
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:36,393
You wouldn't think they called him "demonic Vice commander."

66
00:06:37,886 --> 00:06:41,576
He replaced us with Kondo-Sensei.

67
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:42,812
Yeah...

68
00:06:43,863 --> 00:06:45,320
Pay attention.

69
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,487
All his subordinates love him.

70
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:52,905
In Kyoto, he oversaw the implementation of The Shinsengumi rules.

71
00:06:53,106 --> 00:06:58,539
In the conditions of war, it has become softer, and now it is loved, as once Kondo.

72
00:06:59,563 --> 00:07:00,566
Thank you.

73
00:07:03,024 --> 00:07:05,808
Mr. General, may I address you?

74
00:07:05,809 --> 00:07:08,202
Ceremonies and titles aside, keep it simple.

75
00:07:08,203 --> 00:07:09,222
Why?

76
00:07:09,515 --> 00:07:11,222
I'm not used to this kind of treatment.

77
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,952
What should I call you then?

78
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,746
Well... call me Vice commander.

79
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:21,570
Well then...Vice commander, may I address you?

80
00:07:21,937 --> 00:07:22,712
About?

81
00:07:22,813 --> 00:07:27,057
We're new to the squad, and we don't know where it all started.

82
00:07:27,258 --> 00:07:30,634
How did the Shinsengumi samurai start?

83
00:07:31,268 --> 00:07:34,603
When we arrived in Kyoto, we were called Rosenhane.

84
00:07:35,362 --> 00:07:36,768
Rosenhane?..

85
00:07:37,269 --> 00:07:41,715
In the squad was and Now Rosigui, and Mibu Rosenhane...

86
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:45,100
In the end, we formed the Shinsengumi.

87
00:07:45,614 --> 00:07:49,108
Is it true that you were only thirteen at the beginning?

88
00:07:49,109 --> 00:07:54,201
When the Roshingumi organization broke up, only thirteen people decided to stay in Kyoto.

89
00:07:54,202 --> 00:07:55,771
It can't be!

90
00:07:56,522 --> 00:07:58,680
Well, here's the next example...

91
00:08:00,206 --> 00:08:04,269
There were only eight of us in Edo, counting Kondo-San.

92
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,696
Eight?!

93
00:08:06,334 --> 00:08:08,309
At the beginning, eight.

94
00:08:08,812 --> 00:08:16,659
Kondo-San, ya, Soji, Nagakura, Sanosuke, Heisuke, Gen-San... and Yamanami-San.

95
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,519
Yamanami-San?

96
00:08:19,252 --> 00:08:23,441
This is the one that seppuku committed for violating the rules.

97
00:08:24,574 --> 00:08:28,845
Yamanami was the best samurai among us.

98
00:08:30,582 --> 00:08:34,945
Without it, the Shinsengumi would not exist.

99
00:08:35,346 --> 00:08:36,922
Really...

100
00:08:39,464 --> 00:08:42,443
Okay, enough talking about the past.

101
00:08:43,705 --> 00:08:47,126
Now Shinsengumi is us.

102
00:08:47,863 --> 00:08:49,000
Support our honor.

103
00:08:49,001 --> 00:08:50,065
There is!

104
00:08:50,693 --> 00:08:52,424
Having fun?

105
00:08:52,852 --> 00:08:54,619
Good have enemies sake.

106
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,949
Well, then we'll make another RAID.

107
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,514
Hijikata-San, we can handle this ourselves...

108
00:08:59,577 --> 00:09:00,502
That is?

109
00:09:00,503 --> 00:09:04,490
And you would go to Musashino. I heard President Enomoto is having an evening there.

110
00:09:05,428 --> 00:09:07,646
Yes, it's boring there...

111
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:09,421
I think they're waiting for you there.

112
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,914
I'll leave later.

113
00:09:10,915 --> 00:09:11,447
But...

114
00:09:11,448 --> 00:09:15,863
Nothing... bosses are not late, they are late. ^_^

115
00:09:16,082 --> 00:09:17,635
Exactly?..

116
00:09:18,326 --> 00:09:19,781
Let's go, friends.

117
00:09:20,824 --> 00:09:23,920
Yamano, Aritoshi you too.

118
00:09:24,306 --> 00:09:25,118
There is!

119
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,071
Uridashi Cango, Yamano Yasohachi

120
00:09:34,688 --> 00:09:36,378
What do you think about the situation at the front?

121
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:38,591
It's as if there are fewer of them.

122
00:09:38,592 --> 00:09:40,617
You can immediately see the scout.

123
00:09:40,618 --> 00:09:43,243
But what would that mean?

124
00:09:43,244 --> 00:09:45,273
We must have been scared.

125
00:09:45,274 --> 00:09:48,316
They have dispersed their troops and are going to attack.

126
00:09:48,317 --> 00:09:49,329
Really?!

127
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:53,690
The enemy is determined. It is very likely that tomorrow will be hot.

128
00:09:53,691 --> 00:09:56,346
I don't feel right...

129
00:09:57,278 --> 00:09:59,973
Remember when we all broke into Ikeda-ya?

130
00:10:00,074 --> 00:10:01,792
This is not forgotten...

131
00:10:01,993 --> 00:10:05,884
Of all our comrades, only five of us remained.

132
00:10:06,396 --> 00:10:08,553
So you've been with us for so long?

133
00:10:09,171 --> 00:10:11,902
Don't talk about it.

134
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:15,245
We are the last Shinsengumi samurai.

135
00:10:16,404 --> 00:10:18,079
So that...

136
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:24,879
As Vice commander, I order you to hold your position in Hakodate until the last moment.

137
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,982
This is a matter of life and death. If the OTA will fall...

138
00:10:28,826 --> 00:10:30,094
...we're all dead.

139
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:32,810
Hijikata-San, what will you do?

140
00:10:33,927 --> 00:10:35,699
I'm going back to Goryokaku.

141
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,913
Aren't you going to stay with us?

142
00:10:37,914 --> 00:10:40,645
I will take command of the entire army.

143
00:10:40,646 --> 00:10:42,043
I'm with you.

144
00:10:42,044 --> 00:10:43,192
Prohibit.

145
00:10:43,193 --> 00:10:45,209
Hijikata-San, I'm with you!

146
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,309
And me!

147
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,058
Take us with you!

148
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:49,844
You have to stay.

149
00:10:49,845 --> 00:10:50,927
No way!

150
00:10:50,928 --> 00:10:52,024
What objections!

151
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:52,749
You're leaving us!

152
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:57,556
Is it the duty of the Shinsengumi was not to protect civilians?

153
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:58,427
I understand, but...

154
00:10:58,428 --> 00:10:59,858
Here and stay here!

155
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:05,155
Then let's go like this: someone will take charge of everything here, and I will go with you, Hijikata-San.

156
00:11:05,156 --> 00:11:06,957
Well, well...

157
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:10,146
Ozeki is a veteran, so we can rely on him...

158
00:11:10,147 --> 00:11:13,276
Shimada, come on! You all have to stay here!

159
00:11:13,277 --> 00:11:17,770
Yes, let it be Ozeki. Soma would be fine, too... He's a smart guy, he'd make a good commander.

160
00:11:17,771 --> 00:11:18,711
Shimada!

161
00:11:21,292 --> 00:11:24,474
Hijikata-San! I want to go with you!

162
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,380
This is an order!

163
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:26,188
No!

164
00:11:26,489 --> 00:11:28,708
Shimada-San! Enough!

165
00:11:35,599 --> 00:11:38,771
We will protect Hakodate while our hands are clutching swords!

166
00:11:39,352 --> 00:11:40,488
I'm counting on you.

167
00:11:41,138 --> 00:11:45,502
Shimada. Ozeki. Yamano. Uridashi.

168
00:11:46,752 --> 00:11:49,800
You are now in charge of the Shinsengumi.

169
00:11:53,827 --> 00:11:55,224
Don't worry.

170
00:11:55,913 --> 00:11:58,121
The war is not over yet.

171
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,925
We will fight together again.

172
00:12:15,938 --> 00:12:17,523
Is everyone here?

173
00:12:17,524 --> 00:12:18,751
Everything?

174
00:12:18,852 --> 00:12:20,338
There is no Hijikata-San yet.

175
00:12:21,188 --> 00:12:27,123
Again! Does he even realize that we have an attack on the nose?

176
00:12:27,818 --> 00:12:31,689
This may be the last night when Mr. President and I can have a drink in a small circle...

177
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,970
Hijikata-San was here this afternoon.

178
00:12:35,772 --> 00:12:37,040
Did Hijikata come?..

179
00:12:37,232 --> 00:12:37,928
Yes.

180
00:12:38,254 --> 00:12:40,239
Does he have fun when the situation is like this at the front?!

181
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:45,913
Come on. He just came in to pay us off.

182
00:12:46,618 --> 00:12:48,258
Thank you.

183
00:12:48,359 --> 00:12:49,719
Thanks for the care.

184
00:12:56,166 --> 00:13:01,169
Not worry. He himself knows that a decisive battle is coming.

185
00:13:09,137 --> 00:13:10,619
Recall...

186
00:13:11,578 --> 00:13:20,789
When we collected money from Hakodate merchants for military needs, only he was against it.

187
00:13:22,095 --> 00:13:27,547
He is a man of honor, and does not like to shift his burden on others.

188
00:13:27,548 --> 00:13:28,409
Of course!

189
00:13:29,003 --> 00:13:33,836
Weren't the Shinsengumi units a bunch of ronins who were not averse to plundering the population?

190
00:13:34,383 --> 00:13:36,086
Why would Hijikata change her Outlook on life?

191
00:13:36,287 --> 00:13:38,918
You are mistaken, Ootori-Dono.

192
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,521
Commandant Of Hakodate, Nagai Naoyuki

193
00:13:40,522 --> 00:13:46,522
Shinsengumi samurai ruthlessly punished robbers in their ranks.

194
00:13:47,504 --> 00:13:52,448
By the way, Nagai-sama, you must have known Kondo Isami quite well...

195
00:13:52,886 --> 00:13:55,488
And I remember other rumors!

196
00:13:55,813 --> 00:13:58,877
It was said that they were typical bandits and collected real tribute from merchants.

197
00:13:58,978 --> 00:14:00,889
It's all Serizawa Kamo.

198
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:05,025
These rumors gave rise to the behavior Rosigui, and about the Shinsengumi then and not heard.

199
00:14:05,226 --> 00:14:13,512
Kondo and his colleagues have created five rules of the Shinsengumi, according to which all had to behave like a true samurai.

200
00:14:14,142 --> 00:14:16,063
And they certainly weren't engaged in extortion!

201
00:14:17,755 --> 00:14:19,325
All right.

202
00:14:22,263 --> 00:14:26,416
Can we start now, Ootori?

203
00:14:28,086 --> 00:14:28,888
Are you sure?

204
00:14:30,298 --> 00:14:31,430
There is no need to delay.

205
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:40,847
Attention, please! The President wants to address you.

206
00:14:49,132 --> 00:14:55,730
Lord. We've been protecting Ezo for more than a month.

207
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:59,796
We fought bravely against the armies of Satsuma and Choshu.

208
00:15:00,696 --> 00:15:04,668
However, our forces are exhausted.

209
00:15:05,173 --> 00:15:09,607
We can't win, and therefore no further sacrifice is meaningless.

210
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:16,386
So, I, Enomoto Takeaki, am sorry to inform you...

211
00:15:18,595 --> 00:15:22,495
We will capitulate tomorrow morning.

212
00:15:26,966 --> 00:15:31,591
Tetsu, drink like a man!

213
00:15:33,554 --> 00:15:37,879
Ichimura Tetsunosuke

214
00:15:43,131 --> 00:15:44,825
If you don't want to, don't drink.

215
00:15:44,826 --> 00:15:46,548
No, I like it!

216
00:15:46,549 --> 00:15:52,425
There is nothing wrong with not drinking. Warriors who can't do without sake are no longer samurai.

217
00:15:52,426 --> 00:15:53,984
Really?

218
00:15:54,776 --> 00:15:56,499
Tetsu, let's walk.

219
00:15:57,903 --> 00:15:58,812
There is!

220
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,066
Tetsu, how old are you?

221
00:16:03,067 --> 00:16:04,562
It's sixteen.

222
00:16:05,071 --> 00:16:07,096
You've been in the squad for two years, haven't you?

223
00:16:07,297 --> 00:16:08,069
Yes.

224
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,912
That was the last time we recruited people in Kyoto...

225
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,371
Yes.

226
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,300
Thank you for still being with us.

227
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,827
I'll follow you anywhere, Sensei.

228
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:26,905
You were a very useful person.

229
00:16:27,471 --> 00:16:32,243
There is no greater honor for me than to be near you, Sensei.

230
00:16:33,127 --> 00:16:35,413
I just wanted you to know that I'm grateful.

231
00:16:39,517 --> 00:16:41,309
Do you like Shinsengumi?

232
00:16:42,923 --> 00:16:47,422
I have nowhere else to go.

233
00:16:48,334 --> 00:16:50,356
So you're staying forever...

234
00:16:53,566 --> 00:16:58,405
Sensei, which animal is the strongest?

235
00:16:59,621 --> 00:17:01,144
And why this question?

236
00:17:01,345 --> 00:17:03,321
We started talking about this...

237
00:17:03,886 --> 00:17:10,549
I saw a bear for the first time in these parts, and many said that it was the strongest.

238
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,861
I thought it was a tiger...

239
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:19,776
Sorry, this is a stupid question...

240
00:17:19,777 --> 00:17:24,418
Nothing... I will answer.

241
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:29,641
The strongest is the nue.

242
00:17:30,242 --> 00:17:31,392
Well?

243
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,334
You don't know? Well, you'll find out.

244
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:35,528
Obey...

245
00:17:37,595 --> 00:17:38,460
Hpp.

246
00:17:38,761 --> 00:17:39,887
Yes?

247
00:17:39,988 --> 00:17:41,953
I have a request for you.

248
00:17:41,954 --> 00:17:42,804
I'm listening.

249
00:17:43,005 --> 00:17:44,171
Important assignment.

250
00:17:45,451 --> 00:17:46,200
What should I do?

251
00:17:46,757 --> 00:17:47,667
This is a difficult task.

252
00:17:48,722 --> 00:17:50,268
Ready to execute any order.

253
00:17:53,937 --> 00:17:55,866
Leave here right now.

254
00:17:57,357 --> 00:17:57,922
So...

255
00:17:57,923 --> 00:17:59,571
Go to Tama.

256
00:17:59,772 --> 00:18:03,374
In Hino, you will find a man named Sato Hikogoro - this is my named brother.

257
00:18:04,136 --> 00:18:07,863
I need you to give it to him.

258
00:18:08,164 --> 00:18:10,683
Take it and leave immediately.

259
00:18:11,489 --> 00:18:12,639
But wait...

260
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,476
I warned you: the task is difficult.

261
00:18:14,477 --> 00:18:15,844
I can't do this!

262
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:16,913
You have to do it.

263
00:18:16,914 --> 00:18:18,134
But I run...

264
00:18:18,135 --> 00:18:18,965
This is not an escape!

265
00:18:18,966 --> 00:18:19,304
But after all!..

266
00:18:19,505 --> 00:18:21,179
This is a cause worthy of a warrior.

267
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:28,201
The Shinsengumi are fighting valiantly with Satsuma and Choshu in Hakodate, and I want the people in Tama to know that.

268
00:18:28,402 --> 00:18:30,656
Let me fight with everyone!

269
00:18:37,246 --> 00:18:40,645
If you don't follow orders, you will die.

270
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:47,379
Someone has to do it.

271
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:52,453
And who else can I assign this task to?

272
00:19:09,999 --> 00:19:13,378
It's written about you, too.

273
00:19:14,504 --> 00:19:17,214
Hikogoro-San must find out about this.

274
00:19:18,053 --> 00:19:21,910
Then you find a woman named Okita Mitsu and give her this.

275
00:19:22,845 --> 00:19:25,354
Ask Hikogoro-San where she lives, he must know.

276
00:19:26,213 --> 00:19:27,931
This is Soji's sister.

277
00:19:33,793 --> 00:19:35,379
This?..

278
00:19:39,313 --> 00:19:41,258
It's impossible to explain.

279
00:19:43,895 --> 00:19:45,471
Pass it on.

280
00:19:46,427 --> 00:19:50,257
If you lose it on the way, only seppuku will remain for you.

281
00:19:51,329 --> 00:19:53,362
Will be delivered.

282
00:19:59,793 --> 00:20:01,296
I hope for you.

283
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:02,727
Obey.

284
00:20:04,388 --> 00:20:05,503
Hijikata-Sensei...

285
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:06,687
Don't ask me anything.

286
00:20:08,464 --> 00:20:11,607
Sensei, are you preparing to die?

287
00:20:14,469 --> 00:20:15,090
I...

288
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:16,920
Stay out of sight of the others.

289
00:20:17,798 --> 00:20:21,147
Especially Shimada or Ozeki.

290
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:22,364
Obey.

291
00:20:24,068 --> 00:20:25,143
Go.

292
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,394
Enough for today!

293
00:20:58,395 --> 00:20:59,558
Okay!

294
00:21:06,267 --> 00:21:10,498
Look, what is the most powerful creature in the world? A tiger, right?

295
00:21:10,499 --> 00:21:12,418
I have heard that the lion is also strong.

296
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:14,971
A lion?.. I've never seen him.

297
00:21:14,972 --> 00:21:18,609
They say the lion is the king of beasts. He should be strong.

298
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,868
I think the strongest is the bear.

299
00:21:21,601 --> 00:21:25,739
I happened to fight him with my bare hands once.

300
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,486
It was a big beast.

301
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:28,870
Did you win?

302
00:21:29,171 --> 00:21:30,107
I'm alive.

303
00:21:30,108 --> 00:21:32,077
Well, then, he's not that strong.

304
00:21:32,078 --> 00:21:33,051
Soji!..

305
00:21:33,052 --> 00:21:34,282
Nagakura-San, what do you think?

306
00:21:34,483 --> 00:21:35,314
A tiger, perhaps.

307
00:21:35,515 --> 00:21:37,405
Yes, tiger!

308
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,937
But no! Kato Kiyomasa, I Think.

309
00:21:40,816 --> 00:21:42,456
What does Kato Kiyomasa have to do with this?

310
00:21:42,557 --> 00:21:45,494
Don't you know? He put the tiger down.

311
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:48,503
But we are talking about what kind of creature is the most powerful in the world...

312
00:21:48,504 --> 00:21:50,449
Isn't Kato Kiyomasa a creature?

313
00:21:51,617 --> 00:21:54,278
Yamanami-San, what do you say?

314
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:59,445
Well... I've never seen a tiger or a lion, so I can't say anything about them.

315
00:21:59,646 --> 00:22:05,853
But I'm sure there are still many living things in the world that we don't know anything about.

316
00:22:06,154 --> 00:22:08,900
And one of them may be the strongest.

317
00:22:08,939 --> 00:22:11,557
I still think it's Kato Kiyomasa!

318
00:22:12,046 --> 00:22:15,092
Hijikata-San, what do you think? Well, who is the strongest?

319
00:22:15,765 --> 00:22:16,783
Yes, it's obvious.

320
00:22:16,783 --> 00:22:18,381
Well, who?

321
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:19,898
Well.

322
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:21,673
What is this-well?

323
00:22:22,203 --> 00:22:25,439
You don't know, do you? Well, well.

324
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:31,329
It has a monkey's head, a Tanuki's body, a snake's tail, and tiger's paws.

325
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:33,015
Come on!

326
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,625
Tiger paws?! Does he have a tiger attached here?..

327
00:22:35,826 --> 00:22:39,152
No, only the feet of the tiger.

328
00:22:39,153 --> 00:22:41,449
Does such a thing really exist?

329
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:42,610
Aha.

330
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:48,486
I wouldn't say that... I think nue is created by the human imagination.

331
00:22:48,487 --> 00:22:50,570
I don't think it really exists.

332
00:22:51,741 --> 00:22:54,693
Perhaps the most dangerous creature is a human.

333
00:22:55,617 --> 00:22:56,488
Why?

334
00:22:57,773 --> 00:23:00,976
People deceive each other. Animals never lie.

335
00:23:02,076 --> 00:23:05,864
Oh, that... Yamanami-San, as always, you are looking at the root.

336
00:23:07,494 --> 00:23:09,486
Here after all wrapped...

337
00:23:09,487 --> 00:23:10,434
Enough of this...

338
00:23:10,735 --> 00:23:11,722
That was your question!

339
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:16,762
And let's call Kondo-Sensei? It's boring for him to eat there alone.

340
00:23:17,442 --> 00:23:19,230
Call... Heiske!

341
00:23:20,207 --> 00:23:20,908
Coming!

342
00:23:20,909 --> 00:23:25,300
No. Sensei inherited the Tennen Rishin Ryu school.

343
00:23:25,301 --> 00:23:29,207
From now on, he is not allowed to sit at the same table with us.

344
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:30,906
But it's more fun together!

345
00:23:31,107 --> 00:23:33,915
This is the lot of all the great.

346
00:23:49,631 --> 00:23:52,211
All of them are already dead...

347
00:24:26,245 --> 00:24:27,914
Hijikata-San decided to die.

348
00:24:28,282 --> 00:24:29,184
Shimada-San!

349
00:24:29,285 --> 00:24:30,974
I go to Goryokaku!

350
00:24:30,975 --> 00:24:32,134
Wait!

351
00:24:32,135 --> 00:24:33,805
I will die with him!

352
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,814
Don't you understand yet?

353
00:24:36,713 --> 00:24:39,902
He also assigned us to lead the Shinsengumi.

354
00:24:39,903 --> 00:24:41,077
I don't care!

355
00:24:41,078 --> 00:24:44,738
You don't care about his orders? Shimada-San!

356
00:24:44,739 --> 00:24:45,557
Ozeki!

357
00:24:46,613 --> 00:24:53,298
I realized that Hijikata-San wanted us to stay alive.

358
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,048
But this is nonsense!

359
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:00,893
He told us to move on and take care of the Shinsengumi.

360
00:25:01,914 --> 00:25:04,914
It is our duty to stay alive, no matter what happens.

361
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:10,887
Shimada-San, everything will be fine.

362
00:25:12,117 --> 00:25:14,988
Hijikata-San is not so simple!

363
00:25:16,003 --> 00:25:23,375
He would fight with all his might - they called him the "demonic Vice commander"for a reason!

364
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:43,518
Go.

365
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:44,530
Yes...

366
00:25:45,298 --> 00:25:47,492
In any case, do not get caught by enemies.

367
00:25:47,793 --> 00:25:48,779
Obey.

368
00:25:49,463 --> 00:25:52,551
Run! And don't stop until Tam!

369
00:25:54,203 --> 00:25:54,558
Yes!

370
00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:22,174
Hijikata!

371
00:26:23,617 --> 00:26:24,912
Nagai-sama!

372
00:26:27,749 --> 00:26:29,637
How was the meeting?

373
00:26:29,638 --> 00:26:31,760
I don't understand a damn thing...

374
00:26:31,761 --> 00:26:33,411
What, not all in the collection?

375
00:26:33,412 --> 00:26:35,146
No, that's not the point.

376
00:26:35,347 --> 00:26:38,536
I'm not in the mood to sit there and drink.

377
00:26:38,537 --> 00:26:42,908
Enomoto-San was very sorry that you didn't come.

378
00:26:43,209 --> 00:26:47,017
I don't have any warm feelings for him.

379
00:26:47,018 --> 00:26:48,514
Well, well, don't.

380
00:26:49,071 --> 00:26:55,696
Yeah, he's changed since he came back from Europe.

381
00:26:55,997 --> 00:27:03,541
While everyone is fighting, he is sitting in his room like a European General.

382
00:27:03,542 --> 00:27:06,117
I don't believe such people.

383
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:12,366
However... he's a stubborn man.

384
00:27:13,228 --> 00:27:15,616
Yes, I admit that he is persistent.

385
00:27:15,817 --> 00:27:20,222
But Enomoto-San is a theorist, not a practitioner.

386
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:26,414
Nevertheless, he led the remaining Tokugawa forces.

387
00:27:27,741 --> 00:27:29,576
That's what I'm grateful for.

388
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:34,636
He gave me the opportunity to continue fighting.

389
00:27:34,837 --> 00:27:39,132
I wish he could hear it...

390
00:27:41,044 --> 00:27:42,810
By the way, Nagai-sama...

391
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:43,801
Yes?

392
00:27:43,802 --> 00:27:46,744
We were behind enemy lines today.

393
00:27:47,045 --> 00:27:51,010
It looks like we're really going to be attacked tomorrow.

394
00:27:51,011 --> 00:27:55,284
Similar to that. Enomoto has already made a decision about this.

395
00:27:55,285 --> 00:27:59,785
It seems to me that this will be a decisive battle.

396
00:28:01,686 --> 00:28:05,523
We will not allow it to go according to Satsuma and Choshu's plan.

397
00:28:05,926 --> 00:28:10,009
We will show them the power of loyal Tokugawa vassals!

398
00:28:11,259 --> 00:28:13,603
You see, Hijikata...

399
00:28:14,937 --> 00:28:16,367
Tomorrow we surrender.

400
00:28:18,568 --> 00:28:21,585
Secret negotiations with their headquarters have already begun.

401
00:28:23,143 --> 00:28:26,917
It can't be! We haven't lost yet!

402
00:28:27,118 --> 00:28:30,352
We were told that this was necessary to avoid tomorrow's senseless slaughter.

403
00:28:30,453 --> 00:28:33,189
That's why you can't put an army in the hands of theorists!

404
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:37,136
The outcome of the war is at stake.

405
00:28:38,035 --> 00:28:39,997
You Know, Hijikata...

406
00:28:41,377 --> 00:28:45,884
I think so, too.

407
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,249
Nagai-sama...

408
00:28:48,318 --> 00:28:51,894
But... we could have stopped there.

409
00:28:53,576 --> 00:28:57,507
Nagai-sama, I don't want to hear such pathetic words from YOU.

410
00:28:57,508 --> 00:29:02,569
We fight like demons, although the enemy has a numerical advantage and a secure rear.

411
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:06,149
How many more people should die? May be quite a sacrifice?

412
00:29:06,764 --> 00:29:09,985
Why do you think I'm still fighting?

413
00:29:11,057 --> 00:29:13,597
Because I would be ashamed to look Kondo-San in the eye!

414
00:29:13,598 --> 00:29:16,152
On the day of his execution, I also died.

415
00:29:16,153 --> 00:29:17,553
But I will fight dead, too!

416
00:29:18,784 --> 00:29:24,736
If we lose, Kondo Isami will remain an executed criminal!

417
00:29:25,045 --> 00:29:28,747
How am I going to look him in the eye if we surrender to these scum tomorrow?!

418
00:29:30,966 --> 00:29:32,848
Just ask him to forgive you...

419
00:29:35,466 --> 00:29:38,261
It is not in Kondo-San's nature to be angry at this.

420
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:43,030
You did a great job.

421
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:50,392
Gorekaku has not yet fallen due to the fact that Hijikata Toshizo is fighting with us.

422
00:29:50,793 --> 00:29:59,260
We've all been fighting until now - isn't it time to start living in peace?..

423
00:29:59,735 --> 00:30:05,109
...and watch what kind of world Saigo and Katsura will build?

424
00:30:07,522 --> 00:30:08,876
I apologize.

425
00:30:11,197 --> 00:30:11,955
Where are you going?!

426
00:30:12,498 --> 00:30:13,882
I'll Visit Enomoto.

427
00:30:13,883 --> 00:30:14,979
Don't you dare!

428
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,650
I won't let him give up.

429
00:30:16,651 --> 00:30:18,712
He will not back down from his decision!

430
00:30:19,182 --> 00:30:23,705
So I'll have to kill him.

431
00:30:25,176 --> 00:30:26,318
Hijikata!..

432
00:30:39,739 --> 00:30:41,182
Not here!

433
00:30:42,524 --> 00:30:43,784
Higher up.

434
00:31:02,904 --> 00:31:04,010
Dig here.

435
00:32:06,444 --> 00:32:10,239
(Border (posthumous name) of the Condo is. The characters "kanten" and "daikoji" were usually inscribed in the border of high-ranking samurai.)
Kantan indan janusary of daikoji.

436
00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:16,201
When you think of him, that's all you can think of.

437
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,925
Do not write a lifetime name?

438
00:32:20,918 --> 00:32:28,474
Not worth. It is not known what the people of Satsuma or Choshu will do if they understand who is buried here.

439
00:32:29,175 --> 00:32:30,655
Right...

440
00:32:33,256 --> 00:32:34,693
Hijikata...

441
00:32:34,694 --> 00:32:35,314
I'm listening.

442
00:32:36,231 --> 00:32:39,619
Nagaoka has fallen, now it's Aizu's turn.

443
00:32:40,414 --> 00:32:42,508
We have no chance of winning.

444
00:32:42,809 --> 00:32:44,762
This is still unknown!

445
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:47,439
Morale is high, as always.

446
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,731
Not to worry.

447
00:32:48,993 --> 00:32:50,706
We will protect you to the last.

448
00:32:51,007 --> 00:32:51,896
You don't need to do this.

449
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:56,664
Master?..

450
00:32:57,227 --> 00:33:04,535
I cannot leave this region; but you are not Aizu's vassals, and there is no need for you to remain here.

451
00:33:04,536 --> 00:33:05,619
But!..

452
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:11,990
Go to the North. Join Enomoto Takeaki.

453
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:18,661
Gather the remaining Tokugawa vassals, repel the forces of Satsuma and Choshu.

454
00:33:18,876 --> 00:33:21,544
But you're staying here...

455
00:33:21,745 --> 00:33:24,964
And Kondo, too...

456
00:33:25,365 --> 00:33:26,691
Don't worry about me.

457
00:33:31,695 --> 00:33:34,003
Think only about winning.

458
00:33:36,751 --> 00:33:38,580
The Vice-commander.

459
00:33:39,576 --> 00:33:40,760
I think I should stay.

460
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:43,110
Saito...

461
00:33:43,693 --> 00:33:51,793
I will protect the master and Kondo; you fight and don't worry about it.

462
00:34:03,626 --> 00:34:04,173
I rely on you.

463
00:34:05,271 --> 00:34:05,926
Obey.

464
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:09,226
This is our last duty.

465
00:34:49,664 --> 00:34:51,322
Hijikata-San has arrived!

466
00:34:53,723 --> 00:34:54,746
Not too late...

467
00:34:54,747 --> 00:34:57,458
He insists on meeting with President Enomoto.

468
00:34:57,659 --> 00:34:58,760
Do without.

469
00:34:58,961 --> 00:34:59,597
But he...

470
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:02,426
Tell him to wait. I'll be right there.

471
00:35:02,427 --> 00:35:03,883
And the President...

472
00:35:03,884 --> 00:35:04,605
...you don't have to tell me.

473
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:17,168
I've been waiting for you.

474
00:35:17,669 --> 00:35:20,623
I don't care about you. Take me to Enomoto.

475
00:35:20,624 --> 00:35:22,420
He had already gone to his room.

476
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:23,773
I have a very urgent matter.

477
00:35:23,774 --> 00:35:25,171
I'm listening carefully.

478
00:35:25,172 --> 00:35:26,623
And you don't have to hear that.

479
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,269
Well, I'm the Minister of war.

480
00:35:30,187 --> 00:35:32,849
Is surrender your doing, Minister of war?

481
00:35:34,762 --> 00:35:36,292
We haven't lost yet, but for some reason we're giving up.

482
00:35:37,105 --> 00:35:38,183
To avoid complete destruction.

483
00:35:38,184 --> 00:35:39,808
I won't let anyone destroy us!

484
00:35:45,256 --> 00:35:47,541
Mr. President has made a final decision.

485
00:35:47,542 --> 00:35:50,081
That's why I say: take me to Enomoto!

486
00:35:51,844 --> 00:35:55,523
I don't quite understand... did you come in the middle of the night to challenge his decision?

487
00:35:55,524 --> 00:35:58,434
He was expecting you earlier, but you weren't there.

488
00:35:59,071 --> 00:36:01,371
I thought you were getting ready to die...

489
00:36:01,372 --> 00:36:05,141
And you are here to celebrate and have fun?

490
00:36:06,668 --> 00:36:11,615
So you're going to enjoy life?

491
00:36:12,406 --> 00:36:16,703
Why did I have to come to this disgusting gathering?

492
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:21,508
Hijikata Toshizo still has the honor.

493
00:36:21,509 --> 00:36:24,522
All these are words, and our situation is getting worse and worse.

494
00:36:24,523 --> 00:36:29,001
And we, as leaders, must do something.

495
00:36:29,002 --> 00:36:30,974
And it doesn't have to be an attack.

496
00:36:30,975 --> 00:36:34,382
And whose fault did we get to this?!

497
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:40,586
You were about to capitulate, and my men fought and died a few hours ago!

498
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,108
Don't worry, I've decided to take your people back.

499
00:36:46,109 --> 00:36:53,380
Soooo! So you are going to get us out of the way, because we are the last obstacle for you?!

500
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:58,756
You forget yourself!

501
00:36:58,757 --> 00:37:04,138
War is a dangerous business, and you are afraid to take risks for the sake of victory!

502
00:37:07,586 --> 00:37:12,103
Hijikata-kun, I can see your fighting spirit, but you know what this is all about...

503
00:37:13,969 --> 00:37:16,070
Yes, I offered to capitulate.

504
00:37:16,071 --> 00:37:19,557
But in fact, I intend to continue fighting.

505
00:37:21,662 --> 00:37:22,883
What do you mean?

506
00:37:25,414 --> 00:37:28,683
We are supported by Ezo - weapons, ammunition, and supplies.

507
00:37:29,234 --> 00:37:38,271
In addition, due to the advantageous location of Goryokaku can we stay here at least another six months.

508
00:37:38,894 --> 00:37:40,173
A long siege?..

509
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:45,832
In six months, winter will come, and the enemies are not used to the local frosts.

510
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:49,336
The enemy will not attack for a while,

511
00:37:49,337 --> 00:37:54,452
meanwhile, we will gather a huge army of our supporters...

512
00:37:54,453 --> 00:37:55,238
Coward!

513
00:37:56,543 --> 00:37:57,370
That's rude!

514
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:02,409
You're a theorist, so you don't know much about people.

515
00:38:03,151 --> 00:38:03,936
That is?

516
00:38:04,137 --> 00:38:06,440
The Aizu clan has fallen, and so has Nagaoka.

517
00:38:06,641 --> 00:38:10,316
Who will support us if we lose again?

518
00:38:10,317 --> 00:38:12,218
We will have to look for allies outside of Hokkaido.

519
00:38:12,219 --> 00:38:18,828
Yes, even if we talk only about Ezo-where are the guarantees that even existing allies will not run away?

520
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:20,865
Do you think there's nothing you can do?

521
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:23,805
Isn't it prudent to think through all the options?

522
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:28,468
Chips on the table are one thing, but life is another.

523
00:38:30,307 --> 00:38:31,860
Morale is all we have left.

524
00:38:31,861 --> 00:38:33,420
What are your suggestions?

525
00:38:34,509 --> 00:38:35,456
Attack.

526
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:40,905
It is useless to move the entire army.

527
00:38:40,906 --> 00:38:44,910
You should scatter and sting the enemy in weak places.

528
00:38:44,911 --> 00:38:46,502
When the enemy moves to the sea-attack from the mountains.

529
00:38:46,503 --> 00:38:48,648
When the enemy turns to the mountains-attack from the sea.

530
00:38:48,649 --> 00:38:50,191
What is the goal?

531
00:38:50,492 --> 00:38:57,035
When the enemy realizes that we have started a guerrilla war, they will be afraid.

532
00:38:57,944 --> 00:39:01,216
Because such wars can go on for years and decades.

533
00:39:01,776 --> 00:39:02,927
Breaking the spirit of your enemies is what you need.

534
00:39:03,528 --> 00:39:06,701
Good plan! Sooner or later we will be crushed.

535
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,115
I won't allow it!

536
00:39:09,065 --> 00:39:10,115
Swear.

537
00:39:13,341 --> 00:39:14,194
Enough!

538
00:39:16,075 --> 00:39:18,711
Everything has been decided long ago! Change something...

539
00:39:18,712 --> 00:39:20,311
That's why I came!

540
00:39:20,312 --> 00:39:21,758
Hijikata-kun!

541
00:39:23,081 --> 00:39:25,447
You must obey me.

542
00:39:26,843 --> 00:39:32,547
Once, in Shinsengumi, Kondo Isami could turn a blind eye to your arbitrariness, but now...

543
00:39:32,772 --> 00:39:33,477
Hey!

544
00:39:34,093 --> 00:39:35,107
I demand a meeting with the President.

545
00:39:35,108 --> 00:39:36,339
I'm the Minister of war!

546
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,516
It's useless to talk to you.

547
00:39:38,427 --> 00:39:39,243
What impudence!

548
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:40,127
Get out of the way.

549
00:39:41,771 --> 00:39:42,982
Stupid!

550
00:39:45,874 --> 00:39:47,964
Enomoto thinks the same way I do!

551
00:39:47,965 --> 00:39:50,530
Then I will kill Enomoto and then you.

552
00:39:50,631 --> 00:39:51,903
Somebody!

553
00:39:59,012 --> 00:39:59,964
Hijikata.

554
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:01,160
President...

555
00:40:05,686 --> 00:40:07,062
Go to the office.

556
00:40:07,063 --> 00:40:07,587
But!..

557
00:40:07,588 --> 00:40:08,556
No matter.

558
00:40:09,413 --> 00:40:10,872
Then I did...

559
00:40:11,073 --> 00:40:11,964
You are free.

560
00:40:14,317 --> 00:40:19,217
Bring wine and two glasses, and these... sandwiches.

561
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:31,762
Since the President himself is calling , we'll have to go.

562
00:40:39,444 --> 00:40:46,131
At the end of last year, taking Goryokaku, we chose the President, remember?

563
00:40:47,191 --> 00:40:48,207
So what?

564
00:40:48,408 --> 00:40:51,821
Enomoto-San said that this is how the head of state is elected in America.

565
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,009
He always does what they do abroad.

566
00:40:57,115 --> 00:40:58,414
So?..

567
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:02,801
Enomoto-San received 149 votes out of 150.

568
00:41:04,724 --> 00:41:07,635
I remember it now...

569
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:12,206
There was only one vote for you, wasn't there?

570
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:14,557
So what?

571
00:41:15,425 --> 00:41:21,996
Only one person wanted you to be President...

572
00:41:22,597 --> 00:41:29,774
...you know, it's not very fair to vote for yourself.

573
00:41:32,212 --> 00:41:34,451
And now this has nothing to do with it!..

574
00:41:39,469 --> 00:41:41,389
You don't have to talk about it...

575
00:41:44,497 --> 00:41:46,558
You and Ootori are such funny people...

576
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:49,082
Once you meet, it starts all around you...

577
00:41:49,083 --> 00:41:51,487
I'm sorry, Mr. President, but he is...

578
00:41:51,488 --> 00:41:52,744
Well, well, don't.

579
00:41:53,615 --> 00:41:57,122
Ootori always starts bickering with you, even if he wasn't going to.

580
00:41:57,123 --> 00:42:02,875
In your disputes, the right decision is born - it also does not yield to the last.

581
00:42:02,876 --> 00:42:04,359
We never found a way to win.

582
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:08,956
True, but thanks to you and Ootori, we've held out so far.

583
00:42:09,257 --> 00:42:15,195
And at the moment we have the strongest army in Japan.

584
00:42:15,496 --> 00:42:17,149
The most... strong?

585
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:19,028
I really think so.

586
00:42:19,029 --> 00:42:23,774
I would not have achieved such success myself, even if all the gods had helped me.

587
00:42:25,049 --> 00:42:27,639
Mr. President, let me address you.

588
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:32,346
Yes, I just wanted to talk to you in private.

589
00:42:32,447 --> 00:42:36,857
Since you didn't attend the Banquet ...

590
00:42:36,858 --> 00:42:39,482
You will have to drink alone.

591
00:42:41,567 --> 00:42:42,956
Thank you, I don't want to.

592
00:42:42,957 --> 00:42:43,859
Keep me company.

593
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,214
Foreign sake? I will not.

594
00:42:45,215 --> 00:42:49,148
It feels strange at first, but then you get used to it.

595
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:50,997
No, thanks.

596
00:42:54,257 --> 00:42:55,669
Then try this.

597
00:42:57,889 --> 00:42:59,303
You don't know, do you?

598
00:42:59,304 --> 00:43:05,103
Playing cards are very popular in Europe, and since you can only play cards with one hand,

599
00:43:05,104 --> 00:43:08,235
they invented sandwiches.

600
00:43:08,236 --> 00:43:11,359
Really, it's so European.

601
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,122
We have in Japan is the onigiri.

602
00:43:13,323 --> 00:43:15,873
For me, eating them is much easier.

603
00:43:16,374 --> 00:43:19,168
Well, if you don't want to eat yet, don't eat.

604
00:43:22,118 --> 00:43:25,928
You are a really interesting person, Hijikata-kun.

605
00:43:26,745 --> 00:43:27,424
What?

606
00:43:27,725 --> 00:43:30,345
You don't like anything European very much.

607
00:43:30,715 --> 00:43:32,882
I hate the West.

608
00:43:33,383 --> 00:43:35,681
That's my character.

609
00:43:35,682 --> 00:43:39,011
And you look at yourself.

610
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:44,250
I heard that you are the only one of the Shinsengumi who has cut his hair and dressed in the Western style.

611
00:43:44,251 --> 00:43:46,838
European clothing is just more convenient.

612
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:50,450
During the battle, it is much easier to move in it.

613
00:43:52,808 --> 00:43:55,059
And the Japanese hairstyle needs to be taken care of.

614
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:55,722
Really...

615
00:43:55,723 --> 00:43:57,331
I hate all useless things.

616
00:43:57,332 --> 00:44:01,046
That's what I'm saying-you have a European way of thinking.

617
00:44:01,547 --> 00:44:04,804
We have a lot in common.

618
00:44:05,816 --> 00:44:07,048
You're joking.

619
00:44:07,049 --> 00:44:12,095
It takes you out of yourself, but nevertheless

620
00:44:13,863 --> 00:44:16,279
What's that under your nose?

621
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:17,745
This?

622
00:44:17,746 --> 00:44:22,476
How long does it take you to take care of these European things?

623
00:44:22,477 --> 00:44:24,448
I like to take care of my mustache.

624
00:44:24,649 --> 00:44:26,968
Many useful Western inventions are impressive, but not this.

625
00:44:26,969 --> 00:44:29,040
Appearance is also important.

626
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,838
It's just an imitation.

627
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:34,951
I only adopt what I really need.

628
00:44:34,952 --> 00:44:37,873
I'm sorry, of course, but you and I are the exact opposite.

629
00:44:40,389 --> 00:44:41,869
Okay...

630
00:44:46,106 --> 00:44:46,955
It's delicious.

631
00:44:47,956 --> 00:44:49,096
Why are we giving up?

632
00:44:49,397 --> 00:44:51,270
This is our only way out.

633
00:44:51,471 --> 00:44:54,170
It doesn't lead anywhere. Cancel the decision.

634
00:44:54,871 --> 00:44:55,923
I won't do that.

635
00:44:57,399 --> 00:44:58,898
Then I have no other choice.

636
00:45:01,506 --> 00:45:03,197
You can kill me.

637
00:45:04,077 --> 00:45:08,649
But what will you do then?

638
00:45:09,603 --> 00:45:11,289
I will take command of the army.

639
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:13,302
You know...

640
00:45:13,303 --> 00:45:14,331
Well.

641
00:45:14,332 --> 00:45:16,082
I'm sorry, but you can't do it.

642
00:45:16,483 --> 00:45:18,732
They won't even let you leave the room.

643
00:45:18,733 --> 00:45:22,123
Then I'll do seppuku, right here.

644
00:45:22,324 --> 00:45:23,791
Really...

645
00:45:25,272 --> 00:45:25,929
I've made up my mind.

646
00:45:27,093 --> 00:45:29,378
How inconvenient it is...

647
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:32,147
In this case, my death will be completely meaningless.

648
00:45:32,522 --> 00:45:33,191
Exactly.

649
00:45:35,651 --> 00:45:40,656
I'm sorry, but I can't stand pointless actions any more than you can.

650
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:49,034
Okay, I'll reverse the decision. Let's stop this farce. Lower your sword.

651
00:45:52,263 --> 00:45:54,937
Do you want us to fight to the end?

652
00:45:55,038 --> 00:45:55,856
Yes.

653
00:45:56,589 --> 00:45:57,962
What should we do?

654
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:02,113
The war is not over yet. We have a chance.

655
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,305
A chance to win?

656
00:46:03,406 --> 00:46:07,371
Give me a hundred men and I will turn the tide of the war.

657
00:46:07,372 --> 00:46:08,517
Uselessly.

658
00:46:09,118 --> 00:46:10,332
Why?

659
00:46:10,989 --> 00:46:12,732
Explain more?

660
00:46:13,555 --> 00:46:18,991
You see... you're not going to win.

661
00:46:18,992 --> 00:46:20,195
This is not true!

662
00:46:20,742 --> 00:46:22,580
You sound very confident.

663
00:46:22,581 --> 00:46:28,160
But you see what it is... one of us is very smart and knows better than the rest of us that we are finished.

664
00:46:28,161 --> 00:46:31,433
This person is you, Hijikata-San.

665
00:46:34,046 --> 00:46:38,018
Are you going to die? In the next battle, right?

666
00:46:40,302 --> 00:46:45,050
You think that honor is more important than life, and you want to die.

667
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:49,083
And to such a man should I entrust the lives of our people?

668
00:46:51,552 --> 00:46:56,511
I don't want senseless sacrifices.

669
00:46:57,917 --> 00:47:00,083
So you're going to give up, no matter what?

670
00:47:01,725 --> 00:47:03,498
No matter what.

671
00:47:06,541 --> 00:47:12,390
I've fought the enemy so far, and I'm not going to retreat for no reason!

672
00:47:13,449 --> 00:47:15,332
Are you such a fool?..

673
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:17,991
After the surrender, my life's work will be destroyed.

674
00:47:18,192 --> 00:47:22,856
I'm already dead. You don't have to kill me - I'll make a seppuku no later than twenty-four hours.

675
00:47:25,972 --> 00:47:29,481
And my death will save thousands of people.

676
00:47:31,568 --> 00:47:32,260
That's a lie...

677
00:47:32,261 --> 00:47:33,225
It's true.

678
00:47:33,626 --> 00:47:36,075
I'm a samurai, no matter what I look like.

679
00:47:36,576 --> 00:47:39,623
You are serious , and I am no less serious.

680
00:47:40,026 --> 00:47:41,881
Can I leave everything to you?

681
00:47:57,488 --> 00:47:59,041
If so, I don't need troops.

682
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:05,662
Let me kill myself, and then you can give up.

683
00:48:07,689 --> 00:48:09,293
Sorry, you can't do that either.

684
00:48:09,694 --> 00:48:10,276
Why?

685
00:48:11,648 --> 00:48:14,051
I decided so, Hijikata-kun.

686
00:48:14,752 --> 00:48:19,625
Only I should die, and no one else. 

687
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:24,249
What am I supposed to do?

688
00:48:25,914 --> 00:48:28,180
What to do? Well...

689
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:44,705
I think we should have a drink.

690
00:48:44,906 --> 00:48:49,044
You shouldn't judge unfamiliar things strictly, right?

691
00:49:06,716 --> 00:49:10,516
Do you know the difference between sake and grape wine?

692
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:14,746
In the method of preparation.

693
00:49:15,695 --> 00:49:19,713
Rice no matter how much you press, it will not become sake; and this makes grapes wine.

694
00:49:19,714 --> 00:49:24,215
Grapes begin to ferment themselves, they do not need additives.

695
00:49:24,416 --> 00:49:29,022
So the wine is obtained in a completely natural way.

696
00:49:29,651 --> 00:49:31,894
This is very European.

697
00:49:38,206 --> 00:49:39,353
Not bad, is it?

698
00:49:40,716 --> 00:49:42,251
Well, not bad.

699
00:49:42,652 --> 00:49:44,017
But not very well.

700
00:49:44,218 --> 00:49:47,764
No matter what you say, time doesn't stop.

701
00:49:49,764 --> 00:49:52,715
One day they will make wine in Japan.

702
00:49:54,253 --> 00:49:58,738
Especially here: the climate in Ezo is similar to that of Europe.

703
00:49:59,679 --> 00:50:04,874
You will see that the wine here will be drunk all over the world.

704
00:50:08,008 --> 00:50:09,660
Try a sandwich.

705
00:50:19,889 --> 00:50:24,598
Enomoto-San, there's something I don't understand...

706
00:50:25,528 --> 00:50:26,449
What?

707
00:50:28,196 --> 00:50:29,590
You.

708
00:50:30,874 --> 00:50:32,140
And, there's that!

709
00:50:32,141 --> 00:50:37,110
I don't always understand myself, so it's okay.

710
00:50:39,188 --> 00:50:45,390
When I first heard of your plans to go to Ezo,

711
00:50:46,978 --> 00:50:49,672
I was amazed at how out of touch they were with reality.

712
00:50:53,536 --> 00:50:55,828
You said you were going to come here,

713
00:50:55,929 --> 00:51:01,316
little by little, gather strength and eventually become a separate Republic.

714
00:51:02,381 --> 00:51:07,877
You said that you want to build the future of the Japanese on a par with Satsuma and Choshu.

715
00:51:10,107 --> 00:51:14,327
It was so absurd that it inspired me.

716
00:51:16,107 --> 00:51:21,498
Thanks to you, our morale has risen to an unprecedented level.

717
00:51:21,499 --> 00:51:26,801
But you must have realized that all this is just a dream.

718
00:51:28,291 --> 00:51:31,238
You could not hope to be allowed to separate from Japan.

719
00:51:33,212 --> 00:51:34,788
But there's nothing wrong with that.

720
00:51:36,404 --> 00:51:46,530
All we wanted was to prevent Satsuma and Choshu from reshaping the world to their own standards.

721
00:51:47,943 --> 00:51:50,521
That's why I bet on Enomoto Takeaki.

722
00:51:55,184 --> 00:52:01,868
So why are we now bowing to them without fighting to the end?

723
00:52:05,007 --> 00:52:09,085
I admit I was disappointed in you.

724
00:52:10,201 --> 00:52:11,784
I can only apologize.

725
00:52:12,291 --> 00:52:18,700
I am ashamed that I, who followed Kondo Isami, believed for a moment in Enomoto Takeaki.

726
00:52:19,792 --> 00:52:23,102
You thought I was a follower of the Condo itself and was disappointed.

727
00:52:23,103 --> 00:52:24,997
Yes, I think it's unbearable.

728
00:52:27,663 --> 00:52:30,065
Kondo-San was a man of high ideals.

729
00:52:31,421 --> 00:52:34,082
He followed the path that he believed was the only right one.

730
00:52:34,752 --> 00:52:41,618
And though it was not easy, people followed him, won over by his directness.

731
00:52:43,703 --> 00:52:47,343
I'm sorry, you're a different person.

732
00:52:49,483 --> 00:52:50,552
Naturally.

733
00:52:53,099 --> 00:52:54,689
I Am Enomoto Takeaki.

734
00:52:56,383 --> 00:53:00,353
However, Hijikata, you made a mistake.

735
00:53:04,473 --> 00:53:06,836
I was quite serious then.

736
00:53:08,241 --> 00:53:18,858
You seemed to think it was a utopia, but I really wanted to create a new country.

737
00:53:19,881 --> 00:53:20,782
Go.

738
00:53:35,903 --> 00:53:39,821
I didn't expect you to be so realistic.

739
00:53:40,736 --> 00:53:41,764
A realist?..

740
00:53:41,765 --> 00:53:46,480
Realists are those who, like you, live not in dreams, but only in reality.

741
00:53:47,105 --> 00:53:51,065
Accurate judgment about what is happening on the battlefield is most important to them.

742
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:53,368
They don't catch cranes in the sky.

743
00:53:54,817 --> 00:53:56,440
But I'm not.

744
00:53:58,511 --> 00:53:59,357
What are you?

745
00:54:00,274 --> 00:54:02,531
I'm a hopeless romantic.

746
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,944
Satsuma and Choshu shout that they are building a new country, but what are they really doing?

747
00:54:11,422 --> 00:54:14,753
They destroyed the Tokugawa regime and continue to destroy Japan.

748
00:54:14,954 --> 00:54:20,485
And I wanted to start a new state from scratch.

749
00:54:21,779 --> 00:54:22,654
See.

750
00:54:23,117 --> 00:54:32,737
Around such open spaces, not occupied by anyone, clean water, fertile land, rich in iron and coal subsoil.

751
00:54:34,219 --> 00:54:39,746
When I set foot on this earth, I immediately wanted to build a new world here.

752
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:44,198
Unlike you, I didn't kill people.

753
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:50,241
I studied for a long time in the Netherlands, and previously taught in the Naval Department.

754
00:54:51,192 --> 00:54:53,730
I've never been a real samurai.

755
00:54:54,700 --> 00:55:04,854
But that day, I decided that I had allowed Satsuma and Choshu enough to run Japan, and it was time to stop.

756
00:55:09,108 --> 00:55:13,927
You were right: up to this point, I was only looking for death.

757
00:55:15,425 --> 00:55:21,036
And you yourself, it seems, until this moment, and really intended to win...

758
00:55:21,037 --> 00:55:21,833
Certainly.

759
00:55:24,315 --> 00:55:25,410
You're a fool.

760
00:55:29,721 --> 00:55:31,622
Thanks for the compliment.

761
00:55:32,895 --> 00:55:34,506
But now the dream is over...

762
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:39,717
And since it's over, I, like any honest samurai, must give up.

763
00:55:40,524 --> 00:55:46,382
Now my task is to save the lives of those who helped me maintain this crazy dream.

764
00:55:49,786 --> 00:55:54,982
In fact, after the war ended, I wanted to raise cows ...

765
00:55:55,637 --> 00:55:56,615
Cows?

766
00:55:57,313 --> 00:55:58,644
Countless herds.

767
00:56:00,603 --> 00:56:01,480
Sounds impressive...

768
00:56:02,419 --> 00:56:03,861
Have you tried cow's milk?

769
00:56:05,132 --> 00:56:05,863
No.

770
00:56:06,827 --> 00:56:07,341
I don't want to!

771
00:56:09,151 --> 00:56:12,329
For Europeans, milk is a very important product.

772
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:16,916
They also make butter and cheese out of milk.

773
00:56:17,788 --> 00:56:18,621
Cheese?

774
00:56:19,903 --> 00:56:22,775
You tried the sandwich. That thin inside...

775
00:56:24,076 --> 00:56:25,458
Was it cow's milk?

776
00:56:25,983 --> 00:56:27,070
Was it delicious?

777
00:56:27,981 --> 00:56:28,381
Yeah.

778
00:56:29,402 --> 00:56:33,689
I would like the Japanese to eat it, too.

779
00:56:34,228 --> 00:56:42,421
For this purpose, I wanted to establish pastures here, raise cows, and raise agriculture here,

780
00:56:42,622 --> 00:56:45,747
to make people westernized and wealthy.

781
00:56:46,823 --> 00:56:52,567
To do for his country something more than what you do Satsuma and Choshu.

782
00:56:56,003 --> 00:56:58,142
But all this remained a dream.

783
00:57:01,832 --> 00:57:02,792
President!

784
00:57:04,298 --> 00:57:05,053
I was looking for you...

785
00:57:07,886 --> 00:57:08,867
Is something wrong?

786
00:57:08,868 --> 00:57:11,088
All the squad leaders returned.

787
00:57:11,471 --> 00:57:12,376
Thank you, good.

788
00:57:12,377 --> 00:57:16,019
Everyone is concerned about your decision and wants to talk to you.

789
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:17,619
I'm coming.

790
00:57:18,081 --> 00:57:19,031
Go.

791
00:57:24,405 --> 00:57:25,407
Attention!

792
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,117
Sit, sit.

793
00:57:32,757 --> 00:57:36,745
Mr. President will speak!

794
00:57:39,195 --> 00:57:40,293
Sit down.

795
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:50,341
Thank you for your efforts.

796
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,428
The war is over.

797
00:57:55,106 --> 00:58:00,319
For being with me so far, I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

798
00:58:01,950 --> 00:58:05,204
After all this , are we really giving up?

799
00:58:08,764 --> 00:58:10,558
But we can still fight!

800
00:58:11,075 --> 00:58:14,707
Why should we give up?

801
00:58:15,711 --> 00:58:16,719
Hijikata-San!

802
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,192
Mr. President, we will hold on to the end!

803
00:58:52,991 --> 00:58:54,496
And what do you think?

804
00:58:56,655 --> 00:58:58,165
You heard them.

805
00:59:01,611 --> 00:59:03,020
I've already decided we're giving up.

806
00:59:03,021 --> 00:59:04,036
Don't give up!

807
00:59:06,208 --> 00:59:08,071
You amaze me.

808
00:59:09,004 --> 00:59:10,787
What have we been talking about for so long?

809
00:59:15,222 --> 00:59:16,182
I noticed something.

810
00:59:19,063 --> 00:59:21,328
I thought only of death.

811
00:59:22,716 --> 00:59:26,377
And all you have in mind is surrender.

812
00:59:28,771 --> 00:59:31,029
But we overlooked something important.

813
00:59:33,066 --> 00:59:33,599
So what?

814
00:59:35,294 --> 00:59:36,440
You should never give up.

815
00:59:39,258 --> 00:59:43,444
You are, of course, a fool and a hopeless romantic.

816
00:59:46,326 --> 00:59:48,961
But I put my life on the line for another hopeless romantic...

817
00:59:49,462 --> 00:59:52,418
...make the best samurai in Japan.

818
00:59:53,788 --> 00:59:58,072
I guess my purpose is to follow such people.

819
00:59:59,325 --> 01:00:04,080
I am ready to fulfill your dream.

820
01:00:04,281 --> 01:00:05,897
But I told you it was over.

821
01:00:05,898 --> 01:00:06,857
This is not true.

822
01:00:07,982 --> 01:00:09,710
We still have until dawn.

823
01:00:09,911 --> 01:00:13,857
Enomoto-San, shall we try?

824
01:00:15,071 --> 01:00:17,110
Now it will not be a battle to die in.

825
01:00:17,863 --> 01:00:21,116
It will be a battle for survival.

826
01:00:27,988 --> 01:00:29,074
You know...

827
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:33,421
You mispronounce the word "romantic".

828
01:00:33,875 --> 01:00:34,900
Don't shorten it.

829
01:00:36,574 --> 01:00:37,324
I knew it.

830
01:00:39,267 --> 01:00:40,996
Rely on me.

831
01:00:40,997 --> 01:00:42,615
We understood each other.

832
01:00:43,983 --> 01:00:45,418
In the first place?

833
01:00:45,619 --> 01:00:49,415
First of all, the military Council.

834
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:51,830
Hijikata-kun.

835
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:56,619
I owe you an apology.

836
01:00:57,284 --> 01:00:57,684
For what?

837
01:00:58,663 --> 01:01:01,378
I misjudged you.

838
01:01:02,253 --> 01:01:02,753
In what sense?

839
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,604
The most hopeless romantic is you.

840
01:01:15,128 --> 01:01:16,228
How do I win?

841
01:01:41,563 --> 01:01:42,814
Would you like more wine?

842
01:01:42,815 --> 01:01:45,755
Not now. We will win-then as much as necessary.

843
01:01:48,681 --> 01:01:50,558
And the sandwich?

844
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:52,176
Please don't get distracted.

845
01:01:52,377 --> 01:01:53,581
Okay.

846
01:01:56,422 --> 01:01:59,572
In Kyoto, did you make plans the same way?

847
01:01:59,873 --> 01:02:00,738
Yes.

848
01:02:00,739 --> 01:02:04,160
And then, when was the incident in Ikeda-ya?

849
01:02:04,261 --> 01:02:06,815
At that time, we made a plan together with Yamanami-San.

850
01:02:07,216 --> 01:02:08,144
By whom?

851
01:02:08,445 --> 01:02:10,255
This was my friend from Edo.

852
01:02:10,756 --> 01:02:13,805
I came up with a plan in General terms, and he worked out the details.

853
01:02:14,306 --> 01:02:16,425
This was done in Shinsengumi.

854
01:02:16,826 --> 01:02:20,785
Well, I'll try to replace him.

855
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:25,144
No way.

856
01:02:30,765 --> 01:02:32,624
Come on, you're good in your place.

857
01:02:35,586 --> 01:02:36,554
What's so funny?

858
01:02:36,555 --> 01:02:38,156
Don't worry so much.

859
01:02:38,257 --> 01:02:39,418
Okay.

860
01:02:41,843 --> 01:02:44,518
I think I know the map like the back of my hand, but it looks strange...

861
01:02:45,083 --> 01:02:46,089
In what sense?

862
01:02:50,889 --> 01:02:55,139
I used to think only about where I was going to die.

863
01:02:57,135 --> 01:03:02,939
And now I intend to survive, and now the map looks completely different...

864
01:03:06,977 --> 01:03:07,335
Concocted.

865
01:03:11,445 --> 01:03:14,854
So, let's start the Council!

866
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:16,399
I beg.

867
01:03:17,350 --> 01:03:20,057
It will be like the battle of Okehazama.

868
01:03:20,528 --> 01:03:21,788
Okehazama?

869
01:03:23,115 --> 01:03:26,724
The essence of our previous actions was that Satsuma and Choshu attacked and we defended.

870
01:03:28,546 --> 01:03:31,098
When protecting Hakodate, this is the best way.

871
01:03:31,399 --> 01:03:35,765
From the South we have a natural wall - mount Hakodate, in the Bay is our fleet.

872
01:03:35,766 --> 01:03:39,175
The city is patrolled by troops of the Shinsengumi.

873
01:03:40,046 --> 01:03:44,167
If we don't falter, it won't be easy for the enemy to land.

874
01:03:45,176 --> 01:03:46,264
Is everything correct so far?

875
01:03:46,765 --> 01:03:47,296
Yes.

876
01:03:48,111 --> 01:03:52,883
Our enemy thinks the same way, so he will divide his forces into three parts.

877
01:03:52,884 --> 01:03:55,064
To surround us from the North and West.

878
01:03:56,141 --> 01:04:03,675
Their goal is Goryokaku, and during tomorrow's attack, they will shrink back.

879
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:05,437
How can this be avoided?

880
01:04:06,167 --> 01:04:06,967
And we will not avoid it.

881
01:04:08,424 --> 01:04:10,153
They have about ten thousand people.

882
01:04:10,775 --> 01:04:12,869
They'll try to outnumber us.

883
01:04:13,431 --> 01:04:17,053
If you just push the armies, the one with the most soldiers wins.

884
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:21,788
But there is one way to overcome the superior forces of the enemy.

885
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:23,403
Don't pull!

886
01:04:25,252 --> 01:04:28,986
The more forces the enemy has and the more dispersed they are,

887
01:04:29,701 --> 01:04:31,891
the worse he sees his own vulnerabilities.

888
01:04:32,672 --> 01:04:33,844
This is our goal.

889
01:04:35,305 --> 01:04:38,898
We will strike at the weakest point.

890
01:04:45,591 --> 01:04:47,770
This is how Nobunaga defeated Imagawa.

891
01:04:49,024 --> 01:04:54,331
When the commander has little strength, it makes no sense to defend - you need to attack.

892
01:04:55,014 --> 01:04:56,388
So you mentioned Okehazama?

893
01:04:58,636 --> 01:05:05,419
In these parts, there are trails known only to the locals, which can be used to infiltrate the enemy in the rear,

894
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:13,255
attack the headquarters at the Tomikawa river and behead the enemy.

895
01:05:13,256 --> 01:05:15,027
The chief of staff, Kuroda of Recca...

896
01:05:15,428 --> 01:05:16,143
Yes.

897
01:05:16,144 --> 01:05:17,129
How many soldiers will you take?

898
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:20,681
Fifty is enough. A large squad won't help.

899
01:05:22,253 --> 01:05:25,980
The enemy has a large army, so confusion in the headquarters will be fatal.

900
01:05:26,181 --> 01:05:30,822
After killing Kuroda, we will immediately turn around and attack the enemy from the rear.

901
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:35,583
And you, Enomoto-San, when you notice the panic of the enemy, then attack from Goryokaku.

902
01:05:37,543 --> 01:05:40,633
And we'll get your favorite sandwich.

903
01:05:41,279 --> 01:05:43,545
The enemy will be caught between us.

904
01:05:43,546 --> 01:05:44,365
Really...

905
01:05:44,366 --> 01:05:47,630
If we succeed, the outcome of the battle will not depend on the number of troops...

906
01:05:47,631 --> 01:05:50,042
...and from the one who will have more courage.

907
01:05:50,243 --> 01:05:51,447
Impressive.

908
01:05:52,626 --> 01:05:53,249
Do you like it?

909
01:05:55,223 --> 01:05:57,676
I think we can really win.

910
01:05:58,501 --> 01:06:02,776
I have not lost a single battle on land during my stay here.

911
01:06:04,818 --> 01:06:06,560
Well thought out.

912
01:06:08,076 --> 01:06:13,698
Our enemy is nue, consisting of Satsuma, Choshu, and Tosa.

913
01:06:14,921 --> 01:06:18,662
But the man is able to defeat any monster.

914
01:06:19,384 --> 01:06:20,466
What are you talking about?

915
01:06:23,391 --> 01:06:24,350
No matter.

916
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:30,710
President...

917
01:06:31,334 --> 01:06:32,747
What else?

918
01:06:32,948 --> 01:06:35,560
We can still win this war.

919
01:06:36,378 --> 01:06:37,684
Battle for survival, right?

920
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:40,468
Yes, for survival.

921
01:06:43,914 --> 01:06:45,238
Minute.

922
01:06:45,239 --> 01:06:47,769
When you go on a sortie, who will command the army?

923
01:06:48,601 --> 01:06:50,107
I rely on you.

924
01:06:51,345 --> 01:06:56,857
I can, of course, but wouldn't it be better to leave it to Ootori?

925
01:06:58,584 --> 01:07:00,705
I don't think our plan will please him.

926
01:07:01,579 --> 01:07:03,995
So that leaves only you.

927
01:07:05,009 --> 01:07:09,977
Well, what do you think of Hijikata-kun's plan?

928
01:07:23,231 --> 01:07:24,847
Stop hiding.

929
01:07:25,248 --> 01:07:26,400
You noticed...

930
01:07:26,701 --> 01:07:30,457
It was obvious when you looked at your feet.

931
01:07:31,472 --> 01:07:32,855
What were you doing there?

932
01:07:35,288 --> 01:07:40,149
I was going to get rid of you first, so you wouldn't talk nonsense.

933
01:07:41,382 --> 01:07:45,001
Then I listened to about completely hopeless plans...

934
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:49,661
Stop!

935
01:07:53,167 --> 01:07:54,173
Hijikata...

936
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:56,097
Thanks.

937
01:07:57,722 --> 01:07:58,410
For what?

938
01:07:58,884 --> 01:08:01,264
For inspiring President Enomoto to fight on.

939
01:08:07,363 --> 01:08:09,069
Defense is my specialty.

940
01:08:12,062 --> 01:08:15,033
You don't have to worry and fight as much as you want.

941
01:08:17,476 --> 01:08:21,663
Ootori-San, I noticed something while looking at you...

942
01:08:22,048 --> 01:08:23,068
What are you talking about?

943
01:08:23,845 --> 01:08:29,776
When the President announced the surrender, you looked the most unhappy of all those present.

944
01:08:33,236 --> 01:08:36,401
A person who lives only on theories cannot have such a face.

945
01:08:40,494 --> 01:08:41,537
I rely on you.

946
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,963
Uh, wait a second!

947
01:08:50,964 --> 01:08:54,347
Have you already decided everything without me?

948
01:09:11,139 --> 01:09:16,665
If we win tomorrow, the enemy will be defeated.

949
01:09:18,073 --> 01:09:26,014
Satsuma and Choshu will think about it and perhaps give us the opportunity to develop these wild lands.

950
01:09:26,572 --> 01:09:35,959
When this bright moment comes, we will begin to build Ezo-a new country.

951
01:09:38,022 --> 01:09:42,125
A country where Kondo Isami won't be a criminal?

952
01:09:42,326 --> 01:09:43,467
Of course.

953
01:09:43,799 --> 01:09:46,653
He will be one of the heroes who gave birth to this country.

954
01:09:47,254 --> 01:09:50,219
May the memory of him not be blotted out for centuries.

955
01:09:56,536 --> 01:10:00,334
For a long time I was interested in: what kind of greeting is this?

956
01:10:01,037 --> 01:10:04,972
Hijikata, this is our greeting now.

957
01:10:06,563 --> 01:10:08,429
Our new country.

958
01:10:27,479 --> 01:10:28,973
Don't get into trouble!

959
01:10:29,541 --> 01:10:35,677
Take care of your strength, move carefully, lure the enemy!

960
01:10:35,678 --> 01:10:36,324
Understand?

961
01:10:52,001 --> 01:10:52,981
Where did this come from?

962
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:54,033
from the North.

963
01:10:54,034 --> 01:10:54,991
Send a scout!

964
01:10:54,992 --> 01:10:55,720
Yes!

965
01:11:03,465 --> 01:11:04,871
Begun.

966
01:11:11,006 --> 01:11:13,611
The enemy went on the offensive at Fort Akagawa!

967
01:11:24,182 --> 01:11:26,019
Fort akagawa has been captured!

968
01:11:27,058 --> 01:11:29,729
Are we just going to stand there and watch? We can go to the rescue!

969
01:11:29,730 --> 01:11:32,040
Hijikata-San's order to wait!

970
01:11:32,541 --> 01:11:36,496
He told them not to move until they entered the city.

971
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:47,170
FORTS Syracuse and Kangin fell, the enemy's heading this way.

972
01:11:47,271 --> 01:11:52,367
As soon as the soldiers return from those FORTS, we gather the main forces and prepare for battle.

973
01:11:58,595 --> 01:12:00,671
I leave everything to you.

974
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,294
Well done!

975
01:12:05,595 --> 01:12:08,084
However, the real battle is just beginning!

976
01:12:08,685 --> 01:12:10,239
Keep your head up!

977
01:12:34,813 --> 01:12:38,258
The enemy moves quickly, will soon come to Fort Kikino.

978
01:12:38,482 --> 01:12:42,728
They are so wrapped up in the onset that he could not see anything except Goryokaku.

979
01:12:42,729 --> 01:12:44,110
As we expected.

980
01:12:45,158 --> 01:12:47,596
Kuroda's headquarters remained unprotected.

981
01:12:50,836 --> 01:12:51,846
Key point.

982
01:13:23,144 --> 01:13:24,129
Kondo-San...

983
01:13:26,232 --> 01:13:28,537
Sorry for the delay.

984
01:13:30,125 --> 01:13:32,118
I'll catch up with you soon.

985
01:13:44,243 --> 01:13:47,908
Our goal is their bid. We need the head of the BOJ's Resca!

986
01:13:47,909 --> 01:13:48,588
Go ahead!

987
01:14:19,844 --> 01:14:20,657
Listen!

988
01:14:20,858 --> 01:14:24,796
The enemy is still far away, but the order can come at any time!

989
01:14:24,797 --> 01:14:26,174
Everyone be ready!

990
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:33,324
What for?..

991
01:15:33,525 --> 01:15:36,017
Enemy soldiers on top of the mountain!

992
01:15:36,477 --> 01:15:37,272
What ?!

993
01:16:07,161 --> 01:16:08,491
Don't back down!

994
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:30,563
Haridasi!

995
01:16:38,961 --> 01:16:39,822
Haridasi!

996
01:17:06,957 --> 01:17:07,854
Forward.

997
01:17:23,869 --> 01:17:25,367
They are on mount Hakodate...

998
01:17:33,957 --> 01:17:38,109
It looks like they landed at night and somehow climbed the mountain.

999
01:17:38,110 --> 01:17:40,531
I can't believe it... as with Headache...

1000
01:17:40,532 --> 01:17:47,227
If the Shinsengumi at the foot of Hakodate retreat to Benten Fort, the city will be taken and the battle will lose its meaning!

1001
01:17:48,558 --> 01:17:52,210
How annoying, there was only one step left!

1002
01:17:52,211 --> 01:17:54,162
Unbelievably...

1003
01:17:56,535 --> 01:17:57,617
Hijikata...

1004
01:17:57,818 --> 01:17:59,161
Where Is Hijikata?!

1005
01:18:15,214 --> 01:18:15,990
Hijikata!

1006
01:18:15,991 --> 01:18:17,074
Where is Ootori-sama?

1007
01:18:17,075 --> 01:18:18,291
Sending reinforcements to Hakodate.

1008
01:18:18,784 --> 01:18:19,812
Oh, good.

1009
01:18:19,813 --> 01:18:22,690
Since they've taken the city, we'll make our sandwich right here.

1010
01:18:23,091 --> 01:18:24,184
I leave the rest to you.

1011
01:18:24,943 --> 01:18:25,688
Hijikata!

1012
01:18:25,989 --> 01:18:29,451
Don't go there, stay.

1013
01:18:29,652 --> 01:18:30,353
Come on!

1014
01:18:30,454 --> 01:18:31,676
It's just beginning.

1015
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:35,375
I think best when plans fall apart.

1016
01:18:36,248 --> 01:18:39,586
I'll help out my old comrades and get Kuroda's head.

1017
01:18:40,725 --> 01:18:41,645
Don't try to die.

1018
01:18:43,075 --> 01:18:44,002
I promise.

1019
01:18:49,874 --> 01:18:50,865
Enomoto-San!

1020
01:18:52,594 --> 01:18:53,805
Do something to stay alive.

1021
01:18:57,938 --> 01:19:01,472
And make your dream come true.

1022
01:19:03,321 --> 01:19:04,168
A dream?..

1023
01:19:05,102 --> 01:19:06,520
How about: develop this land,

1024
01:19:07,513 --> 01:19:10,716
start herds of cows, make cheese...

1025
01:19:11,017 --> 01:19:14,966
This is only you can do.

1026
01:19:56,597 --> 01:19:59,409
Hijikata-San! The enemies were suddenly on the mountain!

1027
01:19:59,410 --> 01:20:02,034
Calm down! As long as I'm here, we won't lose!

1028
01:20:02,910 --> 01:20:04,093
What are the Shinsengumi?

1029
01:20:05,788 --> 01:20:06,635
Probably...

1030
01:20:07,036 --> 01:20:08,327
They are now...

1031
01:20:39,097 --> 01:20:41,615
Look! The enemy ship is sinking.

1032
01:20:42,061 --> 01:20:43,949
This is the first sign of our victory!

1033
01:20:44,502 --> 01:20:46,446
Now is the time to attack their bid.

1034
01:20:46,951 --> 01:20:48,656
As long as you are with me, no one will die!

1035
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:50,308
Follow me!

1036
01:21:24,688 --> 01:21:25,999
Hijikata-San!

1037
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:27,345
Get ready!

1038
01:21:28,155 --> 01:21:29,125
Fire!

1039
01:21:31,152 --> 01:21:32,113
Attack!

1040
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:50,339
Run!

1041
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:52,215
Don't back down!

1042
01:21:52,416 --> 01:21:53,394
Attack!

1043
01:22:05,133 --> 01:22:06,125
Who is it?..

1044
01:22:09,237 --> 01:22:13,762
Vice commander of the Shinsengumi, Hijikata Toshizo.

1045
01:22:33,224 --> 01:22:38,137
Enomoto-San, I'm sorry...

1046
01:23:21,575 --> 01:23:22,220
Toshi...

1047
01:23:28,866 --> 01:23:29,737
Kat-Chan...

1048
01:23:40,244 --> 01:23:41,468
Hijikata?..

1049
01:23:42,643 --> 01:23:43,466
Enomoto-San...

1050
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:52,179
It's over...

1051
01:25:19,028 --> 01:25:20,181
Don't give up!

1052
01:25:20,182 --> 01:25:22,685
Hijikata-San will come to the rescue soon!

1053
01:25:22,686 --> 01:25:23,955
Stand to the death!

1054
01:25:24,865 --> 01:25:26,167
Shimada-San, Mr. Nagai is here!

1055
01:25:26,773 --> 01:25:27,537
Nagai-sama!

1056
01:25:27,538 --> 01:25:28,332
Shimada!

1057
01:25:28,433 --> 01:25:29,733
What happened?

1058
01:25:30,566 --> 01:25:31,379
Hijikata...

1059
01:25:32,394 --> 01:25:33,008
Hijikata-San?..

1060
01:25:34,445 --> 01:25:35,482
Died in a skirmish...

1061
01:25:37,564 --> 01:25:38,381
Thus speak.

1062
01:25:39,214 --> 01:25:40,313
Hijikata-San?..

1063
01:25:40,956 --> 01:25:41,884
It can't be...

1064
01:25:43,964 --> 01:25:46,684
The scouts told me.

1065
01:25:46,685 --> 01:25:49,469
This is not true... He can't die!

1066
01:25:50,177 --> 01:25:52,915
This... are you sure?

1067
01:25:55,703 --> 01:25:57,086
This can't be happening!

1068
01:25:57,287 --> 01:25:59,394
Hijikata-San can't die!

1069
01:26:00,194 --> 01:26:03,973
Shimada-San, stop!

1070
01:26:04,645 --> 01:26:07,661
The battle is over! Don't ruin yourself for nothing!

1071
01:26:08,772 --> 01:26:11,051
You must survive! Survive!

1072
01:26:12,148 --> 01:26:14,449
Continue the Hijikata business.

1073
01:26:15,677 --> 01:26:16,625
Continue...

1074
01:26:18,118 --> 01:26:23,162
Live and see a world where there will be no Shinsengumi.

1075
01:26:23,363 --> 01:26:28,734
This is his last wish and your last duty.

1076
01:26:30,695 --> 01:26:31,755
Nagai-sama!

1077
01:26:32,593 --> 01:26:33,286
I'm here.

1078
01:26:36,697 --> 01:26:39,520
The enemy's parliamentarian wants to talk to you.

1079
01:26:43,857 --> 01:26:45,224
Really...

1080
01:26:48,198 --> 01:26:49,820
Time to give up, huh?

1081
01:26:52,647 --> 01:26:54,024
We are performing.

1082
01:27:54,047 --> 01:28:25,024
Shinsengumi samurai will never die in our hearts!

00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,080
[upbeat music playing]

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,720
-[Aks] Quiet, Mobeen.
-[Mobeen] I ain't going to be quiet.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,680
[Aks] You don’t know what you’re on about.

4
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,440
[Mobeen] I ain't going to be quiet.
You need to listen to me, young lady.

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,240
-Just stay out of it.
-Recognise what I’m saying, yeah.

6
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,000
-Stay out of it.
-Listen to me.

7
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,200
Look at me.

8
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,520
Contouring with a simple Dior palette

9
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,680
brings about outstanding results
in the cheekbone area.

10
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,000
I don’t even want to hear
no more about it.

11
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,080
Whatever. I prefer Rihanna make up, so...

12
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,080
That’s 'cause you’re obsessed
with celebrity, that’s why.

13
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,200
Get a grip on your life, yeah.

14
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,080
I should never have shown you
those YouTube tutorials.

15
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,360
Yeah, well you did.

16
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,480
I subscribed to them all
and now we're here, so there you go.

17
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,320
Yo.

18
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,680
What are you doing, you mup?

19
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,000
What you fucking call me?

20
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,880
Mobeen, let’s just go.

21
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,800
That’s it. Walk away.

22
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,080
I’m going to tell my mum about you.

23
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,520
Mobeena.

24
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,560
Cal!
[both screaming]

25
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,520
Oh, my God, bro!

26
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,040
-[chuckles]
-Bro, you were due for release next year.

27
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,040
Oi, hold on a minute.

28
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,800
Have you escaped?

29
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,000
I can’t be getting arrested right now.

30
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,080
What?

31
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,280
We got bakery class.

32
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,120
-Bakery class?
-Yeah.

33
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,960
Don’t act like you’ve never banged out

34
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,720
a bit of short crust when you’re
in prison, you know what I mean?

35
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,800
You’re right.

36
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,680
It’s actually quite therapeutic
actually that.

37
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,840
Oh, mate.

38
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,560
I can’t believe you’re here, bro.

39
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,760
Come here.

40
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,440
Oh, mate.

41
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,120
-Yeah.
-[sighs]

42
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,960
Little Aqsa.

43
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,520
How big you are now, eh.

44
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,520
You know, last time I seen you

45
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,200
I was showing you which colours
to mix together to make other colours.

46
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,600
-Do you remember that?
-Did that.

47
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,760
I’m just grateful you didn’t teach me
how to mix talcum powder with cocaine.

48
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,160
[laughs]

49
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,840
Oh, sharp as hell.
She ended up just like you, Mobeen.

50
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,920
Uh.

51
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,160
[breathing heavily] Listen, my brother.

52
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,760
We’ve got so much to catch up on,
you know, yeah?

53
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,640
But it stinks of piss around here,
so let’s do it later, yeah?

54
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,200
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Yeah?

55
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,120
Course, course mate.
I’ll say this for now.

56
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,200
I’m ready to be like you.

57
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,520
You want to be like him?
I’d rather stay in prison.

58
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,880
-Oi.
-No.

59
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,480
But you need to show me how.

60
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,560
I need your help blood. You’re out here
living your best life on your deal

61
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,120
and that, brother, I see you.

62
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,840
Ah, I don’t know about
all that best life stuff.

63
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,280
Listen, I know...

64
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,360
everyone thought I’d live and die
by this life, I know that.

65
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,480
Okay.

66
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
But after nine years in that hell-hole...

67
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,120
I ain't going back, you get me?

68
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,960
Nah, nah. You’re not,
you're not, bro. You’re not.

69
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,440
-Ah!
-Mate.

70
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,760
[chuckles]

71
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,840
I’ve never seen two men
cuddle each other so much.

72
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,920
That’s it.

73
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,560
Oh, mate.

74
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,880
-Okay.
-[Aks] Mobeen.

75
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,320
-Okay.
-Let’s go.

76
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,880
-Uh-huh.
-[indistinct]

77
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,280
Yeah. Okay, I got you.
I’ve got to go, yeah.

78
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,760
-I’ve got to go, okay?
-Yeah. All right.

79
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,720
-Yeah?
-Yeah. Nice.

80
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,640
[Mobeen] Come on, let's go.

81
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Have fun with the Filo, bro. Yeah?

82
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,760
-Thank you, my brother.
-Yeah.

83
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,960
I’ll see you soon.

84
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,320
-Soon.
-All right.

85
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,080
Really making up for nine years
on missed cuddles.

86
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,200
Oi. You’re not allowed cuddles in prison.
People take it the wrong way.

87
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,280
-He’s a weirdo.
-He’s harmless.

88
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,800
Why you want to hang around
with him, anyway?

89
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,200
Because he used to be
one of my best mates.

90
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,400
Imagine if I didn’t have anyone
when I came out of prison.

91
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,560
And anyway, it’s not like
we’re going to see him every day, is it?

92
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,760
-Brother.
-Oh!

93
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,440
Hey, back again, bro, yeah.

94
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,120
I remember you was the guy back in the day
to throw the maddest parties.

95
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,120
It probably wasn’t me, though.

96
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,640
-Probably wasn’t me.
-No, no, we had the weed,

97
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,320
we had the honeys. Remember those
two sisters, remember, who we did?

98
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,960
Outstandingly well.

99
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,200
You know, educational endeavours, yeah?

100
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,680
-Can you shush, man?
-You need to throw me a party.

101
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,760
Listen, I’m not really about
that life no more.

102
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,640
Yeah, link up, up prism, yeah.
That old spot from back in the day.

103
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It better be good, though.

104
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,160
No, forget that, it better be perfect.

105
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,800
Okay, mate.

106
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,800
All right, Bashar al-Assad.

107
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,880
Someone’s acting very dictatory today.

108
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,040
Listen, mate. It’ll bang,
don’t worry, yeah?

109
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,160
And, Aqsa, do your other big brother
a favour, yeah?

110
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,600
Next time you see Paige, you tell her...

111
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,400
You tell her I’m going to see her soon.
I just need to get some money in.

112
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,440
No offence, but are you allowed
to see her?

113
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,240
Don’t worry about that.
Don’t worry about the social workers

114
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,880
or her mum or anything like that,
cause none of those arseholes

115
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,240
going to stop me seeing my daughter.
None of them.

116
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,240
Yo, woah, woah, woah, woah.

117
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,760
I’m sorry, kid.

118
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,880
Brother. Mobes, I’m sorry.

119
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,640
Sometimes I end up just...
You know.

120
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,520
Yeah, I know.
Listen, listen, I understand.

121
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,240
We’ll be all right.
We’ve got to get going now but...

122
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,680
We’ll see you later on, yeah.
Okay, yeah?

123
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,000
Oh.

124
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,439
Oh, okay.

125
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,119
Hey.

126
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,400
-[sighs]
-It’s a lot of hugs mate.

127
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,160
-Okay.
-Yeah.

128
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,080
[Aks] Okay.

129
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,840
That was nice.

130
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,120
-Sound hey.
-Sound, yeah, yeah, safe, safe.

131
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,520
Likes holding them, doesn’t he?

132
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,560
-Please.
-[Nate] No.

133
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,840
-Please, Nate.
-[Nate] No.

134
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,200
-Please.
-[Nate] No.

135
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,400
-Please.
-No.

136
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,840
-Yes.
-What?

137
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,280
No. No.

138
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,080
Why can’t you organise
this heaving get together, anyways?

139
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,120
Because I’m still trying to sort out
the thing?

140
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,600
You still haven’t sorted out the thing?

141
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,000
No, but I’m finalising it.
It’s in process. It’s all right.

142
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,880
When am I going to find out
about the thing?

143
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,480
Look. Listen, boys.

144
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,280
Cal is a good guy, you know.
He wouldn’t hurt a fly.

145
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,480
Didn’t he stab a guy in the eyes
with knitting needles?

146
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,800
Yeah.

147
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,360
But he didn’t go blind, so...

148
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,440
Ah, yeah. Well that’s fine then, isn’t it?

149
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,000
Look, he’s bad news.

150
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,880
You know it, I know it, even he knows it.

151
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,840
Yeah, I do. And I never know anything.

152
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,240
And if the party ain't perfect,
we’re all dead.

153
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,720
[chuckles] Don’t be silly.

154
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,320
We’re not all dead.

155
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,760
You two are dead, I’ll be fine.

156
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,120
Look, this ain't time for jokes,
Mobeen Dein.

157
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,080
You could have easily been with Cal the
day he smacked an axe on that guys head.

158
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,960
Yeah, well I wasn’t and I didn’t,
so it’s all hypothetical, innit?

159
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,200
You’re pathetical.

160
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,480
He’s going to drag you back in.

161
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,680
Listen, boys. Can you...
Can you just do it for me?

162
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,640
For me? Please.

163
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,400
Okay, Gandhi.

164
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,480
Thank you.

165
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,360
But look, if we do this
you better tell Aks about the thing.

166
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,160
I promise you I will tell Aks
about the thing.

167
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,680
[whispering] I will. Thank you.

168
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,120
-Eight.
-What?

169
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,400
You can’t wear a Mosque hat in the club.
That is proper harram, that is.

170
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,160
But what about the one with the mirrors
and the jewels on it?

171
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,200
Just save that for when you go on
Britain’s Got Talent, yeah?

172
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,040
When I win Britain’s Got Talent.

173
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,480
[hip-hop instrumental music playing]

174
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,560
[tires screeching]

175
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,080
[Cal] They were going to chop
one of them off.

176
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,200
So I said you could save
either your leg or his dick.

177
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,920
-Which one did he choose?
-His leg.

178
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,960
-What a dick.
-Yeah.

179
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,520
Oh, fuck sake.

180
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,520
Oh, look at the colour coordination
on these boys, innit.

181
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,680
Back streets back, all right.

182
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,040
All right, Azaar,
when’s the new single out?

183
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,440
-You all right, Cal?
-Yeah, you all right?

184
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,680
All right.

185
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,520
Can I ask you a question?

186
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,240
Are you boys currently competing
in the Formula 1 event at the moment?

187
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,320
What you on about, Mobeen?

188
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,040
I only ask cause you pulled up
like it's a Formula 1 pit stop, bro.

189
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,720
Oh, sorry, my man.

190
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,720
Listen, be careful, there’s kids
playing around here.

191
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,040
You’ve got to respect
the green cross code.

192
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,240
Do you remember what
the green cross code is, yeah?

193
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,680
Oh, man's on his period.
Cal, do us a favour, let’s go.

194
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,240
Nah, I’m not about that any more, bro.

195
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,360
I’m trying to do things differently.

196
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,040
Do right by my little girl, dude.

197
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,560
Is that what you call Mobeen these days?

198
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,680
[laughs sarcastically]

199
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,720
-It’s a good one though, innit?
-It's fast.

200
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,800
Listen, these geezers a mong, Cal.
Let’s go, man.

201
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,960
Nah, man, really. With all due respect,
Azaar, I’m out man.

202
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,480
With all due respect, Cal,

203
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,440
some people change, but you’re not one
of those people, do you understand?

204
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,560
I think you’ll find he can lead any
fucking life he chooses to.

205
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,680
Is that understood?

206
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,400
There he is, the old Mobeen.

207
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,280
Woah, woah. All right, lads. Come on.

208
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,520
It’s all right, Cal.
He knows where I’m going.

209
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,120
He knows whose area this is.

210
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,600
Same area that you give up.

211
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,760
Same area that you need to
behave yourself in, mate.

212
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,920
Cal, I’ll see you at your party.

213
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,000
You bring the Hobnob’s
and I’ll bring the bitches.

214
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,880
Come on.

215
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,200
You all right?

216
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,600
I’m calm.

217
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,640
-[Mobeen] Yeah?
-[Cal] Yeah.

218
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,280
[engine starts]

219
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,680
What’s wrong with you?

220
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,600
Look, if the party ain't perfect,
we’re in trouble.

221
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,360
What’s the worst that can happen?

222
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,080
Cal bites our retina’s out
and shoves them up our bottoms.

223
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,160
[inhales] Ow.

224
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,520
What’s a retina?

225
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,160
[sighs] Still no word from the club?

226
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,840
No.

227
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,280
You sure you left your number?

228
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,320
Yeah.

229
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,480
Your number. Not the number eight.

230
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,160
I'm just gonna make a phone call.

231
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,560
[sighs]

232
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,439
[upbeat music playing]

233
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,120
It's mad, innit?

234
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,920
Being out in a world
after so long in there.

235
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,520
[Mobeen] Whee! [laughs]

236
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,760
Mobes, please.

237
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,080
Sorry, sorry.

238
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,400
Stopping any time now, yeah.

239
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,600
Oops. Really tickles your willy now.

240
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,280
Oh, listen. Hey.

241
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,880
Take your time. Adjust, yeah.

242
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,880
As soon as you’ve settled in

243
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,680
you can fix your relationship
with your little girl, bro.

244
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,520
She doesn’t want to know me, blood.

245
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,440
Oh, you have to keep trying, man.
You have to keep trying.

246
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,920
You know your little girl should be
the most important person in your life.

247
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,200
You don’t need me to tell you that.

248
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,640
Look at you sitting here acting like
the perfect parent and that.

249
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,480
Bro, I ain't no perfect parent,

250
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,480
but listen to me, if you think
road is tough out here... [chuckles]

251
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,840
Wait until you’ve got to apologise
to a bunch of 15-year-old girls

252
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,280
who are Instagram living you,

253
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,480
'cause you forgot to pack
their bloody gluten free breads, innit.

254
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,360
No, I ain't doing that.

255
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,560
Then you have much to learn
about the dark side, Cal.

256
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,600
Trust me, man, they’re magical.

257
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,560
Brother, I was thinking of getting
Paige something, little gift and that.

258
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,440
Ah, yeah, real. That’s nice, yeah.

259
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,280
Do you reckon, um...

260
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,320
Could square me on some cash?

261
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,000
Of course. Of course, my brother.

262
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,160
How much do you need?

263
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,680
-Five grand.
-Five grand?

264
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,640
-Five grand now?
-[scoffs]

265
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,480
What you doing, putting a deposit down
on a mortgage, bro?

266
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,400
No, I ain't got no five grand for you.

267
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,600
Bruv, listen. Living this legit life’s
about living on a budget man.

268
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,840
Should never have asked.

269
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,880
Nah, it’s all right. It’s all right.

270
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,800
I tell you what. See if you can go all the
way around, like, when we were kids, yeah.

271
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,880
You do a 360 and I’ll give you 10 grand.
Go on.

272
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,560
-Go.
-Boom. Let’s do this.

273
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,960
I think I’ve got inertia, man.
I don’t feel very well.

274
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,840
-[Cal laughs]
-Please stop, brother. Please stop.

275
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,240
Hello, is that prison?

276
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,920
It’s one of them voice mails.

277
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,520
Hello, prison.

278
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,960
Prism. The name of the club is Prism.

279
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,680
Oh.

280
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,240
I did think that was a shit name
for a nightclub.

281
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,200
-Prison.
-Oh, my days.

282
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,840
Imagine saying you’ll meet
people there. [laughs]

283
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,680
-I’ll see you in prison.
-[both laugh]

284
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,280

[laughs]

288

Are you still on the phone?

Oh, yeah. Um, sorry.
I'll ring you back, nightclub.

Nate. Do you want to dance with me
in jail?

292
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,120

Yeah, sure. You okay?

297
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,040
[Lydia] I just really need
to speak to you again.

298
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,560
Ah, it's not a problem.
I'll be there.

299

chicken nuggets and a burger?

00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,560
Nate, did you see how long the queue was
for prison?

305
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,400
[Nate] I wonder if there are really
nice girls in prison.

306

[both laughing hysterically]

307
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,280
[Eight] I wonder, I wonder if I’ll need ID
to get into prison.

308
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,440
-[Eight] Oh!
-We haven’t done anything yet.

309
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,160
[Eight] For what?

310
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,240
[Nate] The party.

Thank you.

Well, you do look
a little bit older actually.

319
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,960
And heavier. Definitely heavier.

320
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,000
You didn’t tell Cal
that I asked to see you, did you?

321
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,880
No, no, no. Of course not.
Of course not. No, no.

That’s all you need to know, yeah.

Well, I don’t know
what your online activity is.

335
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,320
I haven’t seen you for a little while.

336
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,320
I’m so sorry, you know.
I should have come to see you earlier.

337

My doors always open.
You’re like a second son.

00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,320
[Shady] There’s a massive shit
in the toilet.

341
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,840
Uncle Shady?

342
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,600
Hello, bastard.

343
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,480
-Hm.
-Toilet’s blocked.

344
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,240
Shady’s always been very neighbourly

345
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,640
when it comes to stuff like that,
haven’t you?

346
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,480
It’s a pleasure to remove
the enormous shit for you, Lydia.

347
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,320
Aww. Bless you, sweet heart.

348
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,800
You’re a gentleman.

349
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,320
He ain't no gentlemen.
You need to get him out of your house.

350
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,080
I need to talk about Cal.
I’m worried, genuinely.

351
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,600
-What is it?
-[knock on door]

352
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,240
Just let me get rid of whoever that is.

353
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,880
[humming]

354
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,280
I know exactly what you’re trying to do
up in here, Uncle Shady.

355
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,920
What do you mean, bastard?

356
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,160
You know what I mean, yeah.

357
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,360
That massive lump of [speaks Hindi]
is the closest you're going to get to her.

358
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,280
That’s close enough for me.

359
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,200
That’s disgusting.

360
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,520
[door closes]

361
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,440
Aunt Lyd’s, what’s he doing in your house?

362
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,680
He just does all the odd jobs.
He always has done.

363
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,560
[Shady] Have you been eating
lasagne again, Lydia?

364
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,320
Got yourself a little brown man slave,
yeah?

365
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,440
Hey, don’t be cheeky.

366
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,760
He gets Thursdays off.

367
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,600
[laughs]

368
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,280
Mobeen, I’m genuinely worried about Cal.

369
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,520
I think he’s really struggling.

370
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,600
Yeah, well he would do.
He’s been in the slammer for nine years.

371
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,320
It takes a bit of adjustment, don’t it?

372
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,720
Yeah, but I think he’s at the start
of a really long journey

373
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,360
and he’s got zero aftercare.

374
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,640
I think his head is messed up
after that place.

375
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,040
Listen, we’re family.
I’ve got his back, you know that.

376
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,360
Yeah, well if you’ve got his back,

377
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,760
then you’ve got to cancel this party.

378
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,200
I can’t have him seeing them old faces.

379
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,960
Drugs and alcohol is...

380
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,440
He’s not strong, Mobeen.

381
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,800
Yeah, you’re right. You’re right, just...

382
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,240
Leave it with me, Aunt Lydia,
I’ll sort it out, yeah?

383
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,840
-Yeah?
-Yeah, I promise.

384
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,640
[Shady] It’s out. It’s big one, Lydia.
Really big.

385
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
He’s playing with your shit in there.

386
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,600
He means no harm.

387
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,320
[Shady] Big turd. Big, big turd.

388
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,680
He’s lonely.

389
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,200
Oh, come on.

390
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,080
[hip-hop instrumental music playing]

391
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,160
We’ve arranged your immoral get-together.

392
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,720
We’ve got DJ’s, food, girls.

393
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,640
-Okay, but listen--
-Ice sculpture spells the word cat.

394
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,640
-Cal.
-Cal.

395
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,040
-Really interesting but--
-[Nate] The theme is freedom.

396
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,360
With a less strict roped off area
of eight feet by ten feet.

397
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,160
-We’ve done a banging job.
-Okay, but listen, listen.

398
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,440
We're thinking of getting
a business together as party planners.

399
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,000
Yeah. We’re going to take the N from Nate

400
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,560
and the eight from Eight.
And we’re going to call it...

401
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,800
Nate.

402
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,080
The parties off.

403
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,200
-What?
-Yes, it’s off.

404
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,240
Listen, I...

405
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,800
I appreciate everything you’ve done,
boys, yeah.

406
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,600
But Cal’s not ready for
a party like that right now, man.

407
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,760
It’s not good for him.

408
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,640
Sorry.

409
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,440
-Got other news, though.
-What?

410
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,120
You two get to organise and execute
a new party for tomorrow.

411
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,600
No immoral get-togethers.

412
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,960
-Just make sure that it bangs.
-Yes!

413
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,760
-No.
-Oh, is that a problem, Nathaniel?

414
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,760
It’s just that Frozen Planet’s
on BBC2 again,

415
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,120
and I’m not missing that for anything.

416
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,440
Well, just watch it on catch up.

417
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,720
It’s not the same thing.

418
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,640
I’m pretty sure it’s exactly
the same thing.

419
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,879
[Eight] I don’t think it is,

420
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,960
because if you watch it afterwards,
what if the planet defrosted then?

421
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,959
Eight, you bake the cake because
you make banging cake. Nate...

422
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,040
You take care of the ambience,
you’re good with that, go on.

423
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,000
-Fine.
-Ambient.

424
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,200
Just as long as you sort out the thing.

425
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,000
[Mobeen] I will. I promise
I will sort out the thing, yeah.

426
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,399
I’m sick of this. What’s the thing?

427
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,720
The thing is that Mobeen
still ain't Aqsa’s legal guardian,

428
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,920
and he still ain't told her yet.

429
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,240
What?

430
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,480
Mobeen!

431
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,000
Oh, shit. Hey, hey...

432
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,800
Let, let me, let me talk to you
about this situation.

433
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,480
[laughing] She locked him out of his cave.

-[laughing]
-[speaks Hindi]

435
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,160
Can you two just go
and organise the party, please?

436
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,800
Hey. Hello, Aqsa.

437
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,960
Hello, my baby, it’s me.

438
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,080
[upbeat music playing]

439
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,560
Yeah, well, I don’t know.
Yeah, yeah.

440
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,680
Anyway, listen, can I stay
at yours again tonight?

441
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,720
Yeah, I know. She still won’t let me in.

442
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,120
Thank you, bro.

443
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,640
Anyway, listen, I think I’m in
the wrong place 'cause it says I’m here.

[music playing on radio]

445
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,920
-Mobeen.
-Hi.

446
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,680
Good afternoon, Aunty.

447
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,680
Lovely, looks lovely.

448
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,600
I told you to throw a party for a guy
that’s just come out of prison,

449
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,800
not celebrate the Queen’s
bloody coronation.

450
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,600
And where did you get this hay from?

451
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,400
I feel like I’m in a Waitrose advert.

452
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,920
I quite like it. It’s got like a vibe.
[chuckles]

453
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,520
[laughs sarcastically] Got a vibe.
It’s got a vibe all right.

454
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,360
A vibe where old white people might come
out and play bowls any minute now.

455
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,720
Listen, Cal is not in a good place

456
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,400
and he’s going to flip out
when he sees this.

457
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,120
-Serious?
-He’s going to kill us.

458
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,360
Oh-ho, he’s going to kill you two.

459
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,680
I told you we shouldn’t have done this.

460
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,880
No, you didn't.

461
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,600
I was supposed to.

462
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,000
What we gonna do?

463
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,400
Have they got a graveyard here?

464
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,960
Let's go pick out
a couple of plots, boys.

465
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm serious, Mobes.

466
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,600
Well, you better just hope
he’s in a good mood,

467
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,040
or he’ll stop by B&Q to pick up an axe
on his way here.

468
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,320
You all right, lads?

469
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,760
-You all right, Cal.
-Yeah.

470
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,120
Uh, so, listen, bro, yeah.

Is that real hay?

-[Nate sighs]
-Yes!

480
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,000
-I told you.
-I told you he’d like it.

-Obviously.
-Thank you.

I love it.

491
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,440
So this is the legit life, eh, lads?

492
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,040
This is the legit life, bro.

493
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,480
No more girls and penthouses
and jewellery.

494
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,800
-Eh?
-Hm?

495
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,200
-You all right?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. It’s better.

496
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,080
-A better life.
-Yes. Sure?

497
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,400
Yeah.

498
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,720
Right.

499
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,000
Listen, man. I want you to know
you’ve got friends out here.

500
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,160
You’ve got family as well, eh?

501
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,920
I know prison was tough, bro. I know.

502
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,720
I did it all right, blood.

503
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,120
But I realise my priority
is to provide for my little girl

504
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,920
and my mum, you know.

505
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,880
That's sweet.

506
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,320
Good ain't he. I told you.

What’s he doing here, bro?

511
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,640
Oh, I can’t stand litter bugs.

512
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,960
-He’s on his own, bro.
-Huh?

513
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,640
He’s on his own, all right.

514
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,280
What is this, bro?

515
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,640
Antiques Roadshow?

516
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,160
Where did you get the hay from?

517
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,880
[stammers] I made a cake.
Do you want some?

518
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,400
Yeah. I love some, Eight.

519
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,560
[laughs]

520
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,960
Are you still a waste man, bro?

521
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,800
You’ve been wearing that apron
since school, man.

522
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,440
You’re still the same little weirdo
you was back then.

523
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,560
What's your problem, blood?

524
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,280
No, no, no. You better step back,
you know, Mobeen.

525
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,800
[Mobeen] You know what, Cal,

526
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,920
tell him you’re going straight
and this mug can do one now.

527
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,480
No, no, no. Cal, you tell this waste man
that you come with me, bro.

528
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,720
Go jump in the car.

529
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,960
[gun cocking]

530
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,520
-Cal, what you doing?
-[Mobeen] No, no, Cal?

531
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,880
What are you doing, Cal?

532
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,920
-I’m taking your food, Azaar.
-Come on, Cal, man.

533
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,640
You should never have come
to the Antiques Roadshow alone, blood.

534
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,840
All right, take it.

535
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,640
What did you do that for?

536
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,680
Mobeen, I got it.

537
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,880
Why you pointing it at me?

538
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,400
Not this way. That way.

539
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,840
Mug. Telling them random girls
you’ve got 30k worth of coke in your car.

540
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,480
Oh, it’s my car now, blood.

541
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,640
You two set me up, man.

542
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,120
Nah, Mobeen had nothing to do with this.

543
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,000
You win some, you lose some, Azaar.

544
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,240
Cal?

545
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,160
Sorry, Mobeen.

546
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,840
We can’t all be like you.

547
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,120
You just don’t escape this life, brother.

548
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,360
Don’t do this, man.

549
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,680
-You can’t--
-[sirens approaching]

550
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,360
Cal, you’re a dead man, bro.

551
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,280
-Cal?
-And you, bro!

552
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,560
Azaar, I didn’t have nothing
to do with that.

553
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,160
-You’re a liar.
-[Eight] Mobeen...

554
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,960
-[groans]
-Mobeen, shall I shoot him?

555
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,440
We don’t kill people over cake.

556
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,680
Give me the strap.
Go, go, go, go, go!

557
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,760
Get out.

558
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,520
I need to dump the gun.

559
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,600
[Eight] Run!

560
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,240
Oh, shit.

561
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,760
-Mobeen?
-Yeah?

562
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,160
I’ve dropped my keys in here.

563
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,560
Do you think he’s going to be grumpy
when he wakes up?

564
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,040
He’s not going to be happy, is he?

565
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,000
[speaks Hindi]
Budge, budge, budge.

566
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,480
[sirens approaching]

567
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,000

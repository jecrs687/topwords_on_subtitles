Did you I.D. The cars,
the vehicles?

359
00:20:04,115 --> 00:20:08,729
- As I said before, senora,
they were probably stolen.

360
00:20:08,772 --> 00:20:10,296
- Okay, how can you know
that they're stolen

361
00:20:10,339 --> 00:20:12,515
if you haven't I.D.'Ed them,
and-

362
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,039
and have you blocked the roads
to Santa Natalia?

363
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:19,522
- I assure you, senora, we are
doing everything that we can.

364
00:20:23,047 --> 00:20:25,746
- [Stuttering]
Excuse me for one minute.

365
00:20:29,402 --> 00:20:32,361
[Speaks Spanish]

366
00:20:32,405 --> 00:20:33,928
- All the gates are locked.
The media's gathering.

367
00:20:33,971 --> 00:20:35,886
- I don't want to
talk to the media,

368
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,105
'cause they're just gonna
turn this into a circus.

369
00:20:37,148 --> 00:20:39,673
Look, the local police,
they, uh,

370
00:20:39,716 --> 00:20:42,763
they want to handle
the negotiations.

371
00:20:42,806 --> 00:20:45,940
- Are they qualified?

372
00:20:45,983 --> 00:20:48,290
- I've never heard of anyone
being kidnapped

373
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:50,031
in or around Santa Natalia.

374
00:20:50,074 --> 00:20:52,294
- Neither have I,
and I gotta be honest,

375
00:20:52,338 --> 00:20:54,165
I don't know
if I trust them.

376
00:20:54,209 --> 00:20:56,124
- Aren't there people
who do this? Specialists?

377
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:57,386
- Yes, absolutely.

378
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,432
Eduardo had a friend,
Jorge,

379
00:20:59,475 --> 00:21:02,173
who had a business partner
kidnapped a few years ago,

380
00:21:02,217 --> 00:21:04,045
and they had a private firm
bring him back.

381
00:21:04,088 --> 00:21:05,307
- Do you know
how to reach 'em?

382
00:21:05,351 --> 00:21:07,178
- No,
but Eduardo will know how.

383
00:21:07,222 --> 00:21:10,356
In his, uh... in his contact list,
I'm sure I'll find it.

384
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:12,619
Okay?

385
00:21:12,662 --> 00:21:13,924
[Whispering] I'm gonna go find
that, I'll be right back, okay?

386
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:15,404
- Okay.

387
00:21:15,448 --> 00:21:17,711
[Phone rings]

388
00:21:17,754 --> 00:21:19,495
- Hello?

389
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:21,584
- Yes,
this is senorseptien.

390
00:21:21,628 --> 00:21:24,544
- Hi, this is jayne valseca,
I'm from Santa Natalia.

391
00:21:24,587 --> 00:21:27,198
I got your name from, uh,
Jorge ramos.

392
00:21:27,242 --> 00:21:29,984
- I see.
How can I help you?

393
00:21:30,027 --> 00:21:32,508
- My...

394
00:21:32,552 --> 00:21:35,990
My husband was...
Was kidnapped this morning.

395
00:21:36,033 --> 00:21:38,558
Uh, about three hours ago.

396
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:41,691
- [On phone]
I'm very sorry to hear that.

397
00:21:41,735 --> 00:21:44,564
- I need to retain someone
to help negotiate his release.

398
00:21:44,607 --> 00:21:47,828
- Of course, did senor ramos
advise you of our fee schedule?

399
00:21:47,871 --> 00:21:51,005
- Yes, um, 2,500 a day,
plus expenses.

400
00:21:51,048 --> 00:21:52,920
- Valseca.

401
00:21:52,963 --> 00:21:54,400
Publishing valsecas?

402
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:55,923
- Yes, that's...
That's right.

403
00:21:55,966 --> 00:21:57,794
- Which is why
they targeted you, no doubt.

404
00:21:57,838 --> 00:22:01,363
- But that's crazy,
because we're not rich.

405
00:22:01,407 --> 00:22:04,714
- Oh. Uh, have the kidnappers
made their demand?

406
00:22:04,758 --> 00:22:07,543
- Not yet. I'm... I'm still
waiting for an email from them.

407
00:22:07,587 --> 00:22:11,417
- Please,
tell me what happened.

408
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,463
- Um,

409
00:22:14,507 --> 00:22:16,987
well, there were four men
in three vehicles.

410
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:19,207
We had just dropped
our children off at school.

411
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:22,428
- Excuse me, you were with your
husband when he was kidnapped?

412
00:22:22,471 --> 00:22:24,212
- Yes.

413
00:22:24,255 --> 00:22:25,822
- But the kidnappers
didn't harm you.

414
00:22:25,866 --> 00:22:27,346
- No.

415
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:29,652
- How do you know
they will email you?

416
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:31,437
- Uh, they left a note for me
before they drove...

417
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,265
Drove off with him.

418
00:22:34,309 --> 00:22:36,398
- Did they leave
anything else?

419
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:38,182
- Uh, no, I don't...

420
00:22:38,226 --> 00:22:40,228
Uh, yes.

421
00:22:40,271 --> 00:22:42,361
[Stutters] There was a... a...
A hammer in the front seat.

422
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:46,582
A new one, uh,
the price tag was still on it.

423
00:22:46,626 --> 00:22:48,279
- I'm afraid
we can't help you.

424
00:22:51,457 --> 00:22:54,416
- Uh, I'm sorry,
are... are you not available?

425
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,331
- I recommend you contact afi.

426
00:22:56,375 --> 00:23:01,118
- Afi. The federal police.
I... why can't you handle this?

427
00:23:01,162 --> 00:23:02,424
- Afi will explain it to you.

428
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:03,860
- [Sighs] But...

429
00:23:03,904 --> 00:23:05,209
- You know anyone
in Mexico City?

430
00:23:05,253 --> 00:23:06,863
- My husband's...

431
00:23:06,907 --> 00:23:08,430
My husband has family there.

432
00:23:08,474 --> 00:23:10,867
- Have one of them
go down to afi headquarters,

433
00:23:10,911 --> 00:23:13,304
fill out the proper paperwork.

434
00:23:13,348 --> 00:23:16,090
- To fill out forms?

435
00:23:16,133 --> 00:23:18,658
Okay, but...
- It's almost noon.

436
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:21,269
I suggest
that you act quickly.

437
00:23:21,312 --> 00:23:23,576
Best of luck.

438
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:26,579
[Phone beeps]

439
00:23:29,146 --> 00:23:31,322
- [Sighs]

440
00:23:33,281 --> 00:23:36,371
- Uh, he wasn't interested,
I guess.

441
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,156
- Why not?
- I don't know.

442
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,115
- What was he saying
about afi?

443
00:23:41,158 --> 00:23:43,334
- That we should have them
secure Eduardo's release.

444
00:23:43,378 --> 00:23:44,335
- Federales?
- Wha...

445
00:23:44,379 --> 00:23:46,990
- Someone in Mexico City

446
00:23:47,034 --> 00:23:48,165
has got to
go to their offices

447
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:50,951
and [laughing] fill out forms.

448
00:23:50,994 --> 00:23:52,387
- Carlos is probably home,
let me call him.

449
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,563
- Okay.

450
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:56,826
- Is that the kidnappers,
did they contact you?

451
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:00,047
- No, Olivia,
they're going to send an email.

452
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,178
- Oh. Yeah, right

453
00:24:01,222 --> 00:24:02,484
[phone rings]

454
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:05,095
- Um, I'll get it.
Hello?

455
00:24:05,139 --> 00:24:09,796
- Carlos, hi.
It's your sister.

456
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:12,320
Something bad has happened
to uncle Eduardo.

457
00:24:12,363 --> 00:24:14,931
We need your help.

458
00:24:14,975 --> 00:24:18,065
Talk to jayne,
she'll explain.

459
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:33,080
- [Weeps]

460
00:24:33,123 --> 00:24:35,996
Jayne.

461
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:41,784
[Cries]

462
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:47,137
- Eduardo never
registered these guns

463
00:24:47,181 --> 00:24:48,399
that he inherited
from his father.

464
00:24:48,443 --> 00:24:50,401
The federal police
are coming...

465
00:24:50,445 --> 00:24:52,621
- Senora, we can store them
in one of the upstairs closets.

466
00:24:52,665 --> 00:24:55,058
- Okay.

467
00:24:55,102 --> 00:24:56,712
Gustavo, what do you know
about kidnappings?

468
00:24:56,756 --> 00:24:58,627
- Not a whole lot,
really, uh,

469
00:24:58,671 --> 00:25:02,109
just what I read in the
newspapers or I've seen on TV.

470
00:25:02,152 --> 00:25:03,893
But from the ones
I've read about,

471
00:25:03,937 --> 00:25:07,114
they usually demand
a few hundred thousand dollars.

472
00:25:07,157 --> 00:25:09,812
- Well, we should be able to
manage that.

473
00:25:14,077 --> 00:25:15,514
- That is awful, jayne.

474
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:17,211
I'm calling up
your accounts now.

475
00:25:17,254 --> 00:25:19,953
- [On phone] Between
the checking account and the cd,

476
00:25:19,996 --> 00:25:22,564
we should have about 500,000,
right?

477
00:25:22,608 --> 00:25:24,000
- [On phone] Yeah,
a little more than that.

478
00:25:24,044 --> 00:25:26,568
Just under 550,
almost all of it in the cd.

479
00:25:26,612 --> 00:25:28,614
- Good. That's good.

480
00:25:28,657 --> 00:25:30,703
- But you don't have
access to it.

481
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:32,400
- What do you mean?

482
00:25:32,443 --> 00:25:34,141
- The account
is in Eduardo's name.

483
00:25:34,184 --> 00:25:37,492
You're not a signatory.
- But I... I've...

484
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,059
I write checks on it
all the time.

485
00:25:39,102 --> 00:25:40,626
- On your
checking account,

486
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:42,497
which Eduardo funds every month
from savings and income.

487
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,325
- So I... I'm sorry,
what are you saying?

488
00:25:44,368 --> 00:25:46,022
Are you saying that I don't
have access to my own money?

489
00:25:46,066 --> 00:25:48,721
- Legally it's not yours,
it's Eduardo's.

490
00:25:48,764 --> 00:25:51,332
- But we're married, and if I
can't get access to that money...

491
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:52,463
- I understand.

492
00:25:52,507 --> 00:25:54,465
Let me see
what I can work out.

493
00:25:54,509 --> 00:25:57,164
In the meantime,
is there anything I can do now?

494
00:25:57,207 --> 00:25:59,253
- No.

495
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,951
Thank you.

496
00:26:04,258 --> 00:26:07,696
- Afi called. An agent
is on his way from Mexico City.

497
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,655
- Oh, okay.
That's good.

498
00:26:09,698 --> 00:26:11,308
- He'll be here tonight.
- Great.

499
00:26:11,352 --> 00:26:14,007
Carlos wants to know if there is
anything else he can do.

500
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,008
- Uh...
- Mama too.

501
00:26:15,051 --> 00:26:16,923
- I don't think so.

502
00:26:16,966 --> 00:26:18,881
You know, not until we know
what we're dealing with here.

503
00:26:18,925 --> 00:26:21,449
- Mama said she'd contact
Eduardo's brothers and sisters

504
00:26:21,492 --> 00:26:23,364
and let them know what happened.
- Yeah, that would be helpful.

505
00:26:23,407 --> 00:26:25,279
Maybe she could act
as the point person.

506
00:26:25,322 --> 00:26:26,802
You know, to...
For the extended family.

507
00:26:26,846 --> 00:26:28,891
- I'm sure
she'd be happy to.

508
00:26:28,935 --> 00:26:32,503
It's almost 2:30,
and school will be out soon.

509
00:26:32,547 --> 00:26:34,549
- Yeah, I know.
- Why don't I pick them up?

510
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:37,030
- No, no, no. I, uh,
I always pick them up.

511
00:26:37,073 --> 00:26:39,989
I want...
Them to have the same routine,

512
00:26:40,033 --> 00:26:42,122
things to be normal,
especially now. [Sighs]

513
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:43,993
- Listen, um,
if things get crazy around here,

514
00:26:44,037 --> 00:26:45,778
the kids can come
and stay with us.

515
00:26:45,821 --> 00:26:49,172
- I appreciate that, Olivia,
just... I, uh,

516
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,479
I want to have them close
right now, I think.

517
00:27:00,401 --> 00:27:01,532
- When is he coming back?

518
00:27:01,576 --> 00:27:05,014
- Soon, honey, soon.

519
00:27:05,058 --> 00:27:07,408
- I hate it when
daddy goes away on business.

520
00:27:07,451 --> 00:27:09,410
- I do too, honey.

521
00:27:09,453 --> 00:27:10,541
Why don't you go get your
soccer clothes on, Maria, okay?

522
00:27:10,585 --> 00:27:12,674
- Okay.
- All right.

523
00:27:12,718 --> 00:27:15,808
- Why are the TV trucks
outside the gate?

524
00:27:24,251 --> 00:27:26,949
- Sit. Come sit down.

525
00:27:26,993 --> 00:27:29,604
Sweetheart, please,
sit down, love. Sit down, honey.

526
00:27:32,955 --> 00:27:35,523
- Something happened to dad,
didn't it?

527
00:27:35,566 --> 00:27:41,094
You weren't at school today,
and teachers were whispering.

528
00:27:46,534 --> 00:27:51,452
- Honey, um,

529
00:27:51,495 --> 00:27:56,587
your dad, he, uh, he was kid...
He was kidnapped this morning.

530
00:27:56,631 --> 00:27:58,241
- Is he dead?
- No.

531
00:27:58,285 --> 00:27:59,329
God, no!
He is not.

532
00:27:59,373 --> 00:28:02,942
Sweetheart, no.

533
00:28:02,985 --> 00:28:04,813
- If they killed him,
I'll kill them.

534
00:28:04,857 --> 00:28:06,162
- They're not gonna kill him,
honey.

535
00:28:06,206 --> 00:28:07,990
They're not
gonna kill him.

536
00:28:08,034 --> 00:28:10,514
- How do you know?
- Because I won't let them.

537
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:11,385
We won't let them.

538
00:28:11,428 --> 00:28:13,604
All right?

539
00:28:13,648 --> 00:28:16,216
- We have to find him.

540
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:19,001
We have to bring him back.

541
00:28:19,045 --> 00:28:22,526
- We will.
We will, baby, I promise.

542
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:25,051
I promise you.

543
00:28:25,094 --> 00:28:27,575
All right?
It's gonna be okay, baby.

544
00:28:27,618 --> 00:28:28,837

548
00:28:47,987 --> 00:28:49,815
- Oh, I can't sleep.

549
00:28:49,858 --> 00:28:51,468
- Can I get you something?

550
00:28:51,512 --> 00:28:53,209
- No, no, no,
that's all right, thank you.

551
00:28:53,253 --> 00:28:55,864

I don't understand.

Yes, this is she.

555
00:29:05,091 --> 00:29:09,704
Okay, um, someone will there
to pick you up right away.

556
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,793
Okay.

557
00:29:11,837 --> 00:29:14,361
Uh, the afi agent is here.
He's at the business station.

558
00:29:14,404 --> 00:29:17,016
- He came by bus?
- Apparently.

559
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:19,018
- I'll go get him.

560
00:29:40,387 --> 00:29:42,171
- [Whispering]
Diego, sweetheart.

561
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:45,522
Honey,
why are you sleeping here?

562
00:29:45,566 --> 00:29:47,742
- [Whispering] Keeping her safe
till dad comes back.

563
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:53,443
- Well, good.

564
00:29:53,487 --> 00:29:55,794
That way, he won't have to
worry about her, right?

565
00:29:58,622 --> 00:30:00,102
Sleep tight, baby,
I love you.

566
00:30:00,146 --> 00:30:03,453
- I love you too.
- Okay.

567
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:20,035
- Senoravalseca.
- Yes, I'm jayne valseca.

568
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:21,950
- I'm Raul from afi.

569
00:30:21,994 --> 00:30:23,822
I'm here to help you negotiate
your husband's release.

570
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:31,394
- I'm sorry, I don't understand.
Are you here alone?

571
00:30:31,438 --> 00:30:34,920
- Please,
if we can talk inside?

572
00:30:41,448 --> 00:30:43,972
It's late.
You're all in shock,

573
00:30:44,016 --> 00:30:47,976
and I'm probably not
what you expected, I understand,

574
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,326
but I can assure you
that I am older than I look,

575
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:52,241
and I've been doing this
for a number of years.

576
00:30:52,285 --> 00:30:57,638
- Okay, but, um,
we are in crisis situation here.

577
00:30:57,681 --> 00:31:01,250
No offense,
you arrived by bus, and, uh,

578
00:31:01,294 --> 00:31:03,383
if I may ask,
are you even armed?

579
00:31:03,426 --> 00:31:06,125
- Senora,
I came like this for a reason.

580
00:31:06,168 --> 00:31:07,953
If I had made
a more dramatic entrance,

581
00:31:07,996 --> 00:31:11,130
unmarked SUV, federal plates,
lights flashing,

582
00:31:11,173 --> 00:31:12,914
it might have made you
feel better about me,

583
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:14,873
but it could have
cost your husband his life,

584
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:18,354
and put you
and your children at risk.

585
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:21,183
There's a way
that these things work,

586
00:31:21,227 --> 00:31:22,881
and I can explain everything
in the morning.

587
00:31:22,924 --> 00:31:24,273
- In the morning?
No, no, no, we...

588
00:31:24,317 --> 00:31:26,145
We have to act now.
This is...

589
00:31:26,188 --> 00:31:27,320
- Have the kidnappers
contacted you?

590
00:31:27,363 --> 00:31:29,061
- No, not yet,
they have not.

591
00:31:29,104 --> 00:31:31,454
- No. I don't expect they will,
it's not their m.O.

592
00:31:31,498 --> 00:31:33,108
- But they could
at any moment.

593
00:31:33,152 --> 00:31:35,067
- I doubt they will
tonight.

594
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,808
They're probably sleeping,
which is what I recommend we do.

595
00:31:37,852 --> 00:31:39,506
- [Sighs]

596
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:41,551
- But to be safe,
if you can give me

597
00:31:41,595 --> 00:31:43,945
your user name and password
for your email account...

598
00:31:43,989 --> 00:31:45,599
- And why?

599
00:31:45,642 --> 00:31:47,427
- We'll be logged in
at headquarters.

600
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:50,082
We have sophisticated software
that can quickly identify

601
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:54,042
the isp addresses that
the kidnappers are sending from.

602
00:31:54,086 --> 00:31:56,871
- You don't just have me
working on this with you,

603
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,265
but you have
all the resources of afi.

604
00:32:20,329 --> 00:32:22,592
- [Moans]

609
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:40,192
Oh, jayne.

610
00:33:40,235 --> 00:33:43,543
[Cries]
Oh, jayne.

611
00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:51,986
- There are many different types
of kidnappings in Mexico.

612
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,467
The most sensational
happen in the drug trade,

613
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,686
where the victims
are never seen alive again,

614
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:59,428
but the vast majority
are for money.

615
00:33:59,472 --> 00:34:01,082
There are
express kidnappings

616
00:34:01,126 --> 00:34:03,606
where prompt payment
guarantees expedited service,

617
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:04,433
but that's not
what we have here.

618
00:34:04,477 --> 00:34:06,000
- How do you know?

619
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,915
- Because it was
meticulously executed

620
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:09,482
by a highly coordinated
group of men,

621
00:34:09,525 --> 00:34:11,658
who made themselves
impossible to identify,

622
00:34:11,701 --> 00:34:13,051
and they left behind
the hammer.

623
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:15,096
- What does
the hammer mean?

624
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:17,185
- It's the calling card for
the popular revolutionary army.

625
00:34:17,229 --> 00:34:19,535
- The e.P.R.,

626
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:20,928
but that's a... that's
a political group, isn't it?

627
00:34:20,971 --> 00:34:22,712
- And they don't negotiate

628
00:34:22,756 --> 00:34:24,192
with private security firms
like senorseptien's,

629
00:34:24,236 --> 00:34:25,802
which is why
he referred you to us.

630
00:34:25,846 --> 00:34:28,283
- But what would a political
group want with Eduardo?

631
00:34:28,327 --> 00:34:29,415
Why would they kidnap him,
it doesn't make any...

632
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:31,417
- To finance operations.

633
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,984
But that's the good news.

634
00:34:34,028 --> 00:34:36,944
It's a business deal to them,
a negotiation.

635
00:34:36,987 --> 00:34:39,251
They treat their victims
comparatively well,

636
00:34:39,294 --> 00:34:42,080
and they never kill them.

637
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:43,559
But it's not all
good news.

638
00:34:43,603 --> 00:34:49,348
The ransom will be high,
at least a million dollars.

639
00:34:49,391 --> 00:34:51,219
- We don't have
that kind of money.

640
00:34:51,263 --> 00:34:54,135
- Well, obviously,
they think you do.

641
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:56,137
Another thing you need to know
about e.P.R.,

642
00:34:56,181 --> 00:34:57,791
which
you're obviously learning,

643
00:34:57,834 --> 00:35:00,185
is that they move
at their own pace.

644
00:35:00,228 --> 00:35:03,101
They control
the negotiations.

but I need to see
where you were attacked.

- Uh, they...

649
00:35:29,344 --> 00:35:31,781
They, uh, they dragged
Eduardo from the car

650
00:35:31,825 --> 00:35:37,178
to the Van that was
right in front, and...

651
00:35:37,222 --> 00:35:40,442
I was over here, fighting them,
[Laughs] Which is insane,

Then I grabbed on to the wire
and this...

655
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:55,109
Then they pulled me into the Van
with Eduardo on this side,

656
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:59,331
and...

657
00:35:59,374 --> 00:36:01,507
They put something over my head
so I couldn't see anything more.

658
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,422

00:38:07,807 --> 00:38:08,851
Why can't I just
email them like this?

700
00:38:08,895 --> 00:38:10,636
I don't understand.

701
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:12,159
- They know
we'll be tracing I.P. Addresses.

702
00:38:12,202 --> 00:38:14,030
They'll use a different one
every time.

703
00:38:14,074 --> 00:38:16,032
Open up anonymous accounts,
and then close it.

704
00:38:16,076 --> 00:38:17,686
We'll trace all of them,
in case they slip up,

705
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,558
but they'll send them
from busy Internet cafes,

706
00:38:19,601 --> 00:38:21,168
where there
are no surveillance cameras,

707
00:38:21,211 --> 00:38:23,083
and the customers pay
with disposable cash cards.

708
00:38:23,126 --> 00:38:24,824
- Well,
what does this mean,

709
00:38:24,867 --> 00:38:26,391
"buy chow chow dog,

710
00:38:26,434 --> 00:38:28,480

711
00:38:28,523 --> 00:38:31,004
Austin.
Wait a minute.

712
00:38:31,047 --> 00:38:33,223
Austin, the land deal,
Cal.

713
00:38:33,267 --> 00:38:34,747
- Who is Cal?
- Cal wimberley.

714
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,618
He's a real estate developer
in Austin.

715
00:38:36,662 --> 00:38:37,793
He's been talking
with Eduardo and me

716
00:38:37,837 --> 00:38:40,405
about purchasing
part of our ranch

717
00:38:40,448 --> 00:38:41,667
to build a golf course.

718
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,669
He hasn't made a formal offer,

719
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,366
but the number we've been
kicking around is 8 million.

720
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:48,630
Otherwise this land is just
a beautiful piece of property.

721
00:38:48,674 --> 00:38:50,110
We can't even
borrow against it.

722
00:38:50,153 --> 00:38:51,807
- Was this land deal
common knowledge?

723
00:38:51,851 --> 00:38:55,333
- No, although Santa Natalia
is a very small community.

724
00:38:55,376 --> 00:38:58,031
I'm sure
that some people must know.

725
00:38:58,074 --> 00:39:01,774
- Well, that probably explains
the size of the demand.

726
00:39:01,817 --> 00:39:06,344
- Maybe Cal
is willing to buy now.

727
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:07,910
- [Over speaker] Obviously,
I'll do everything I can

728
00:39:07,954 --> 00:39:09,651
to help secure
Eduardo's release,

729
00:39:09,695 --> 00:39:11,697
but you have to understand,
I don't have the money.

730
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:14,395
I'll need to secure a commitment
from my usual financing sources.

731
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:16,005
It'll take at least a few weeks,
maybe a month.

732
00:39:16,049 --> 00:39:17,790
- A month?

733
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:19,139
- And there's
the same complication

734
00:39:19,182 --> 00:39:20,923
as with the cd account.

735
00:39:20,967 --> 00:39:22,447
The title to the land
is in Eduardo's name.

736
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:24,057
- But we can work around that,
can't we?

737
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,667
- Under the circumstances,

738
00:39:25,711 --> 00:39:27,365
a judge might Grant jayne
power of attorney.

739
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:29,236
- Of course he will.
In the meantime,

740
00:39:29,279 --> 00:39:30,759
I'll move this along
as fast as I can, jayne.

741
00:39:30,803 --> 00:39:32,282
I promise.

742
00:39:32,326 --> 00:39:34,110
- Okay,
thank you very much, Cal.

743
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:40,943
Probably at least a month.

744
00:39:40,987 --> 00:39:42,684
- Even if you get
the 8 million,

745
00:39:42,728 --> 00:39:44,382
it wouldn't be smart
to offer it to the kidnappers.

746
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:46,906
- So how should I respond
to the ad?

747
00:39:46,949 --> 00:39:48,908
- Let them know that you're
concerned about senorvalseca,

748
00:39:48,951 --> 00:39:50,736
and doing everything you can
to secure his release.

749
00:39:50,779 --> 00:39:52,477
- Concerned?

750
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,175
I'm goin' out of my mind.

751
00:39:59,919 --> 00:40:02,356
- Hola, senora.

752
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,803
- I have to tell Maria
what's happening.

753
00:40:14,847 --> 00:40:18,807
Why don't you draft a response
that you think is appropriate.

754
00:40:18,851 --> 00:40:20,853
- Okay.

755
00:40:20,896 --> 00:40:23,551
- You can do that?
Take people for money?

756
00:40:23,595 --> 00:40:27,990
- These are very, very
bad people, sweetheart.

757
00:40:28,034 --> 00:40:31,646
- Was one... was that man in the
car with you one of the bad men?

758
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:35,258
- No, no, no. He's, uh,
he's trying to protect us.

759
00:40:35,302 --> 00:40:37,086
His name is Raul.

it's the kidnappers.
Their goal is to frighten you

and bully you
into giving them what they want.

801
00:43:03,015 --> 00:43:04,407

do that is through your husband.

Still difficult.

1043
01:00:19,572 --> 01:00:22,096
Again, request lower asking
price.

1044
01:00:26,971 --> 01:00:29,843
- No, wait.
[Groans] No...

1045
01:00:29,887 --> 01:00:32,280
[Gun cocks]
No!

1046
01:00:34,065 --> 01:00:39,070
No, no!
- What is it?

1047
01:00:39,113 --> 01:00:41,942
- "You do not take us seriously,
senora.

1048
01:00:41,986 --> 01:00:44,815
"Here is proof
that you should.

1049
01:00:44,858 --> 01:00:47,818
"If you do not respond with
numbers that are satisfactory,

1050
01:00:47,861 --> 01:00:51,169
we will shoot Eduardo
in the other leg."

1051
01:00:51,212 --> 01:00:54,085
- I know that it looks bad.
I've seen them do this before.

1052
01:00:54,128 --> 01:00:55,869
They're just ratcheting
up the intimidation.

1053
01:00:55,913 --> 01:00:57,654
Listen to me.

1054
01:00:57,697 --> 01:00:58,698
They shoot through
the muscle at close range.

1055
01:00:58,742 --> 01:01:00,657
That cauterizes the wound.

1056
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:02,746
If they have antibiotics,
which I promise you they do,

1057
01:01:02,789 --> 01:01:04,269
other than the pain
of that gunshot

1058
01:01:04,312 --> 01:01:06,227
and whatever recovery time
Eduardo needs,

1059
01:01:06,271 --> 01:01:08,316
there's no permanent damage
or loss of function.

1060
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:11,406
They're just doing this
to get to you.

1061

- [Sniffs]

1062
01:01:18,849 --> 01:01:20,677
- Stop!
- No.

1063
01:01:23,244 --> 01:01:25,725
- Always remember,
he's just merchandise.

1064
01:01:25,769 --> 01:01:29,947
They won't really hurt him.
He's far too valuable.

1065
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:33,167
- It's almost like
waterboarding, isn't it?

1066
01:01:33,211 --> 01:01:37,171
Make the victim feel
as if they're going to die.

1067
01:01:37,215 --> 01:01:40,958
Pull him back from the brink,
make him...

1068
01:01:41,001 --> 01:01:43,308
Then do it again
and again and again.

[Sighs]

1070
01:01:48,835 --> 01:01:53,579
And I'm the victim.

1071
01:01:53,622 --> 01:01:58,366
- Only if you choose to be.

1072
01:01:59,933 --> 01:02:04,677
- Mom, Raul.
Come play.

1073
01:02:09,203 --> 01:02:12,337
- Okay, let's do it.

1074
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:15,993
- Pass it, pass it, pass it.
- Diego, no.

1075
01:02:16,036 --> 01:02:19,344
- Okay.
Nice, nice.

1076
01:02:29,136 --> 01:02:34,576
Good, good.

[Phone rings]

1078
01:02:36,143 --> 01:02:38,580
- I need to talk to you.

1079
01:02:38,624 --> 01:02:40,147
- Esta bien.

1080
01:02:40,191 --> 01:02:43,324
- How much?
- Excuse me?

1081
01:02:43,368 --> 01:02:45,109
- How big of a service fee
do I have to give you

1082
01:02:45,152 --> 01:02:46,501
to gain access to my money?

1083
01:02:46,545 --> 01:02:47,807
- Service fee?
I-I don't...

1084
01:02:47,851 --> 01:02:49,722
- Isn't that what you want,

1085
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:52,812
to free up my money,
is a bribe, yes?

1086
01:02:52,856 --> 01:02:54,814
- Jayne...
No, of course not.

1087
01:02:54,858 --> 01:02:57,991
- Then why won't you
release our money to me?

1088
01:02:58,035 --> 01:03:00,080
- Because I can't.
- What do you mean you can't?

1089
01:03:00,124 --> 01:03:03,562
Of course you can.

1090
01:03:03,605 --> 01:03:05,433
- The bank won't let me.

1091
01:03:05,477 --> 01:03:07,566
- Of course. Why disperse
hundreds of thousands of dollars

1092
01:03:07,609 --> 01:03:09,437
that you don't
expect to get back

1093
01:03:09,481 --> 01:03:11,352
when you can hold onto it
and earn interest.

1094
01:03:11,396 --> 01:03:12,701
- This is not my decision,
jayne.

1095
01:03:12,745 --> 01:03:14,573
- Then whose decision is it?

1096
01:03:19,056 --> 01:03:20,622
- I apologize for this.

1097
01:03:20,666 --> 01:03:22,886
I tried to explain
to senoravalseca that...

1098
01:03:22,929 --> 01:03:27,455
The banks' hands are tied...
That there is nothing we can do.

1099
01:03:29,936 --> 01:03:32,939
- I would like you to listen
very carefully.

1100
01:03:32,983 --> 01:03:36,290
My husband is being held
in captivity and tortured.

1101
01:03:36,334 --> 01:03:38,292
And for months now,
this bank has refused

1102
01:03:38,336 --> 01:03:39,946
to release funds
that could free him.

1103
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:41,905
Money that is his.

1104
01:03:41,948 --> 01:03:44,864
Money that you have no legal
or moral right to hold on to.

1105
01:03:44,908 --> 01:03:47,345
So this afternoon, I'm filing
a lawsuit against the bank

1106
01:03:47,388 --> 01:03:49,782
for misappropriation of funds
and intentional infliction

1107
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,349
of pain and suffering.

1108
01:03:51,392 --> 01:03:55,614
And if Eduardo is murdered
or dies in captivity,

1109
01:03:55,657 --> 01:03:56,963
I will make it
a wrongful death action.

1110
01:03:57,007 --> 01:04:00,445
Do you understand?

1111
01:04:10,672 --> 01:04:11,891
- This is not what
I meant when I said,

1112
01:04:11,935 --> 01:04:13,327
"don't choose to be a victim."

1113
01:04:13,371 --> 01:04:14,981
I meant
"don't let them get to you."

1114
01:04:15,025 --> 01:04:17,984
- You saw the photo... how
much more can Eduardo endure?

1115
01:04:18,028 --> 01:04:20,987
If I keep negotiating
with them on their terms,

1116
01:04:21,031 --> 01:04:23,337
keep selling off everything
that Eduardo and I have,

1117
01:04:23,381 --> 01:04:25,035
there will be nothing left,
and it'll be too late.

1118
01:04:25,078 --> 01:04:26,950
- You cannot give e.P.R.
An ultimatum.

1119
01:04:26,993 --> 01:04:29,256
- Yes, I would like to place
an ad in tomorrow's classifieds

we have... every last cent.

1126
01:04:48,188 --> 01:04:50,234
And they're not going
to get any more.

- You know how they'll respond?
- [Sighs] Yeah.

- I don't know.
I hope so.

to get Eduardo back,

I won't get him back.

- Everything's in place.
- Okay. Keep me posted.

- I will.

1137
01:05:37,368 --> 01:05:39,979
Has senoravalseca backed down
from her position at all?

1138
01:05:40,023 --> 01:05:41,328
- Not an inch.

An e.P.R. Defector
contacted us.

In return for his immunity,
he's giving us information.

He says there's a hostage
being held in Angelica.

- We don't know.

But Eduardo is my husband,
so ultimately,

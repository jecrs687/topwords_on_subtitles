1
00:00:01,047 --> 00:00:03,168
Not everything we did
was because of Chuck.

2
00:00:03,229 --> 00:00:04,260
It was us...

3
00:00:04,355 --> 00:00:06,340
The blood, the sweat,
the tears.

4
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,631
That's us.

5
00:00:07,803 --> 00:00:10,488
There's no way that Chuck
lets us die like this.

6
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:13,538
Hi, Sam.
You're weak.

7
00:00:13,626 --> 00:00:15,262
We're connected
by these wounds.

8
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,427
But all good things
must come to an end.

9
00:00:19,664 --> 00:00:21,127
You cannot
change my mind.

10
00:00:21,215 --> 00:00:22,890
- God lied to me.
-  will help you.

11
00:00:22,978 --> 00:00:24,168
To bind
the spell together,

12
00:00:24,256 --> 00:00:25,749
the nectar from
a Leviathan blossom

13
00:00:25,837 --> 00:00:27,240
that only grows
in one place.

14
00:00:27,328 --> 00:00:28,468
Purgatory.

15
00:00:28,556 --> 00:00:29,610
Sam, smash it.

16
00:00:29,698 --> 00:00:30,940
Now!

17
00:00:31,837 --> 00:00:33,632
I can't.
I'm sorry. I...

18
00:00:34,123 --> 00:00:36,363
Sammy lost hope,
and now I'm free.

19
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,468
Grigori.

20
00:00:37,556 --> 00:00:39,295
They were some of
the first angels on Earth.

21
00:00:39,383 --> 00:00:41,632
Sam: And they've been hunting
humans, feeding off them.

22
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,093
It's time.

23
00:00:43,181 --> 00:00:44,477
- Being normal...
- Is fine.

24
00:00:44,565 --> 00:00:46,842
But you and me? There's zero
about our lives that's normal.

25
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,038
If we don't fix this,

26
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:49,906
we might kill each other
by accident.

27
00:00:49,994 --> 00:00:51,223
So, uh...

28
00:00:51,311 --> 00:00:52,389
Alaska?

29
00:00:52,477 --> 00:00:53,819

73
00:03:19,515 --> 00:03:20,746
Sam?

74
00:03:21,197 --> 00:03:22,573
Dean?

75
00:03:30,406 --> 00:03:31,805
Alaska.

76
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,832
Silent mode's always
an option.

77
00:03:50,454 --> 00:03:52,239
Yeah. Right.
Sorry.

78
00:03:52,843 --> 00:03:54,542
And how's Eileen doing?

79
00:03:55,806 --> 00:03:56,907
She's hanging in there.

80
00:03:56,995 --> 00:03:58,397
She thinks our plan

81
00:03:58,485 --> 00:04:00,613
sounds a little too good
to be true.

82
00:04:01,444 --> 00:04:02,759
You know,
maybe she's right.

83
00:04:02,893 --> 00:04:03,960
I mean,

84
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:06,017
how long
have we been on the road

85
00:04:06,238 --> 00:04:08,053
looking for some
place Garth says

86
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,121
will supercharge our luck,
maybe?

87
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,825
And I mean,
luck?

88
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,558
Is that really even gonna fix
our whole "problem"?

89
00:04:14,646 --> 00:04:16,002
Well, it couldn't hurt.

90
00:04:16,307 --> 00:04:18,610
And I don't know how much more
of this "normal life" crap

91
00:04:18,698 --> 00:04:20,532
I can take,
between the credit cards,

92
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,892
the car trouble,
the constant freaking heartburn.

93
00:04:24,471 --> 00:04:25,835
Well, you know,
if you changed your diet...

94
00:04:25,922 --> 00:04:27,246
You...
all I'm saying

95
00:04:27,342 --> 00:04:28,971
is that this place...

96
00:04:29,183 --> 00:04:30,550
it's not even
in the lore.

97
00:04:30,862 --> 00:04:33,085
Other than Garth,
no one's ever even heard of it.

98
00:04:34,085 --> 00:04:35,224
No, it's there.

99
00:04:35,774 --> 00:04:37,072
It's gotta be.

100
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,498
I mean, Chuck didn't do this
to us

101
00:04:40,586 --> 00:04:43,302
just...
to teach us some messed-up lesson.

102
00:04:43,407 --> 00:04:45,312
You know,
he wants us off our game.

103
00:04:46,076 --> 00:04:47,338
He wants us weak.

104
00:04:47,989 --> 00:04:49,826
'Cause he's coming for us,
Sammy.

105
00:04:51,431 --> 00:04:53,876
And when he does,
if we haven't figured this out,

106
00:04:55,286 --> 00:04:56,760
we're DOA.

107
00:05:13,937 --> 00:05:14,947
Hello?

108
00:05:17,624 --> 00:05:19,736
Uh, yeah, uh, uh,
Jeb Evans,

109
00:05:19,824 --> 00:05:21,891
Sheriff's Department,
Cushing, Oklahoma.

110
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,553
Uh, uh, I'm looking
for an FBI Agent Watts?

111
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:25,688
Um, yeah,

112
00:05:26,087 --> 00:05:29,231
Agent Watts is working a case in,
uh, Alaska.

113
00:05:29,373 --> 00:05:31,566
This is Agent,
uh, Lizzo.

114
00:05:31,654 --> 00:05:32,656
Hmm.

115
00:05:32,872 --> 00:05:34,427
Well, I guess a fed's a fed,
right?

116
00:05:37,443 --> 00:05:39,631
Listen, we got a homicide
down here,

117
00:05:39,763 --> 00:05:42,145
and
my file says that our suspect

118
00:05:42,232 --> 00:05:43,635
might be one of yours.

119
00:05:44,264 --> 00:05:47,073
The murderer is someone
we're looking for?

120
00:05:47,224 --> 00:05:50,641
It says Agent Watts started
a file on him last spring

121
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:52,944
<i>and to call
with any information</i>

122
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,115
regarding
a, uh, Jack Kline?

123
00:05:59,302 --> 00:06:00,316
Jack.

124
00:06:00,522 --> 00:06:01,942
<i>That name ring
a bell?</i>

125
00:06:05,015 --> 00:06:06,334
Yeah.

126
00:06:13,732 --> 00:06:14,900
Hey.

127
00:06:15,304 --> 00:06:16,536
Hey.

128
00:06:18,435 --> 00:06:20,383
What are we doing?
Why did we stop?

129
00:06:20,502 --> 00:06:22,804
Last call on food
for the next few hundred miles.

130
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:25,203
Grab something
out of the cooler.

131
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,229
Oh, yeah, no, I polished off
the last of the sandwiches

132
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,691
while you were out.

133
00:06:29,383 --> 00:06:30,900
We're on a budget.

134
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:36,293
What can we get for, uh,
$4.60?

135
00:06:36,851 --> 00:06:40,091
Um, a slice of pie
and a cup of coffee?

136
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:41,283
Of course.

137
00:06:41,585 --> 00:06:42,775
Two forks?

138
00:06:45,294 --> 00:06:47,120
Damn it, I was hoping
for a cheeseburger.

139
00:06:47,296 --> 00:06:48,654
You can't even digest cheese anymore.

140
00:06:48,845 --> 00:06:50,412
Dude. Lactaid.

141
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:53,315
Alright.

142
00:06:53,402 --> 00:06:56,451
So, if Garth is right,

143
00:06:56,538 --> 00:06:58,886
we take this road,
but, honestly,

144
00:06:58,973 --> 00:07:02,224
it doesn't look like
there's anything up there.

145
00:07:02,311 --> 00:07:03,625
Hey, how long have you
lived here?

146
00:07:03,712 --> 00:07:05,445
- All my life.
- Great.

147
00:07:06,234 --> 00:07:08,616
Can you tell us
what is up that road?

148
00:07:08,717 --> 00:07:09,768
No.

149
00:07:09,856 --> 00:07:11,166
Are you for real?

150
00:07:11,562 --> 00:07:12,791
Did Candy put you up
to this?

151
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:14,241
No,
nobody put us up to this.

152
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:15,670
We're...
We're just headed that way

153
00:07:15,757 --> 00:07:17,370
- and wanted to know
if there's anything up there. <font color=#ffff00>- Um, </font>

154
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,510
forget it.

155
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:19,607
Sounds nuts.

156
00:07:19,695 --> 00:07:21,274
Nuts is good.
Yeah.

157
00:07:21,362 --> 00:07:23,448
A couple of
Mister Freakin' Peanuts here.

158
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:30,117
Okay. There's... There's
kind of this, um, urban legend

159
00:07:30,205 --> 00:07:32,586
around here,
about this place

160
00:07:32,673 --> 00:07:33,620
in the middle
of nowhere.

161
00:07:33,707 --> 00:07:35,588
It's a-a pool hall

162
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:39,338
that is...
magic?

163
00:07:39,513 --> 00:07:41,295
Magic pool hall?

164
00:07:41,851 --> 00:07:43,097
I told ya.

165
00:07:43,184 --> 00:07:45,235
They say that
if you get up there and you win,

166
00:07:45,323 --> 00:07:46,433
then you come back lucky.

167
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,277
Like,
hit the Powerball lucky.

168
00:07:48,556 --> 00:07:49,915
Sounds good to me.

169
00:07:50,064 --> 00:07:52,172
Except for no one
ever does.

170
00:07:52,311 --> 00:07:53,826
What do you mean?

171
00:07:54,024 --> 00:07:57,662
Um, one of our regulars,
Leonard.

172
00:07:57,867 --> 00:07:59,344
The bank was coming
for his house,

173
00:07:59,432 --> 00:08:01,014
so he went out
to find the place

174
00:08:01,117 --> 00:08:02,643
and he never came back.

175
00:08:04,905 --> 00:08:07,742
Heard he had
some sort of accident.

176
00:08:09,142 --> 00:08:10,851
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

177
00:08:14,062 --> 00:08:15,409
Okay.

178
00:08:15,497 --> 00:08:17,579
I guess now we know
what the downside is.

179
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:19,684
Eh, not from where I'm sitting.

180
00:08:19,898 --> 00:08:22,836
A-A pool hall that makes
you lucky or might kill you?

181
00:08:22,923 --> 00:08:24,704
I mean, it sounds like
a demon or a witch or...

182
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,476
Or it could be awesome.

183
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,962
It's pool. The... The...
The game of champions, kings.

184
00:08:30,112 --> 00:08:31,958
My game.
Hell, our game.

185
00:08:32,182 --> 00:08:33,847
How many honest-to-goodness
great memories

186
00:08:33,934 --> 00:08:35,015
do we have
hustling pool?

187
00:08:35,102 --> 00:08:36,215
Yeah,
because we had to.

188
00:08:36,302 --> 00:08:37,577
To eat.

189
00:08:37,936 --> 00:08:39,436
Okay, well, my point is,

190
00:08:39,524 --> 00:08:41,652
is that if pool is the way
that we get our mojo back,

191
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,845
then maybe we ain't as screwed
as we thought.

192
00:08:44,718 --> 00:08:47,419
Hey, you guys drive
an Impala?

193
00:08:48,602 --> 00:08:50,757
I, uh, think you have
a flat.

194
00:08:55,389 --> 00:08:57,042
<i>Okay, you got the video,
right?</i>

195
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,364
Uh, yes.

196
00:08:58,451 --> 00:08:59,910
<i>Okay, so, so,
Vic was </i>

197
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,044
a local doctor,

198
00:09:01,132 --> 00:09:02,286
and the office security

199
00:09:02,374 --> 00:09:04,246
<i>cameras gave us
a good idea of what went down.</i>

200
00:09:04,334 --> 00:09:05,371
Just an idea?

201
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,606
<i>Y-You'll see.</i>

202
00:09:06,693 --> 00:09:08,374
<i>Now, Dr. Sariel was
a good man.</i>

203
00:09:08,461 --> 00:09:10,167
<i>He delivered
both of my kids.</i>

204
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,240
Jack.

205
00:09:12,493 --> 00:09:14,515
<i>This thing's got people
pretty spooked.</i>

206
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,797
I don't understand.

207
00:09:29,015 --> 00:09:32,431
<i>Me, neither. Signal goes out
for about 2 and a half minutes,</i>

208
00:09:32,547 --> 00:09:37,103
during which time, the suspect
kills the doc in his office.

209
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,432
Why?

210
00:09:38,528 --> 00:09:39,763
<i>Keep watching.</i>

211
00:09:45,497 --> 00:09:46,840
Is that... ?

212
00:09:51,003 --> 00:09:52,385
That's his heart.

213
00:10:17,151 --> 00:10:18,185
Relax.

214
00:10:18,423 --> 00:10:19,994
We might actually have some fun.

215
00:10:22,815 --> 00:10:23,948
Right.

216
00:10:32,323 --> 00:10:33,937
Dean, we don't even have
beer money,

217
00:10:34,025 --> 00:10:35,907
much less whatever
the buy-in is here.

218
00:10:35,994 --> 00:10:37,902
Hey,
we'll figure something out.

219
00:10:38,832 --> 00:10:39,940
Get you something?

220
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,426
Yeah.

221
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:43,923
Two waters, por favor.

222
00:10:48,006 --> 00:10:49,397
Hey, uh...

223
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:51,670
- Evie.
- Evie.

224
00:10:52,315 --> 00:10:54,259
Say, listen, if, uh,
me and my brother here

225
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,024
wanted to get ourselves
a game... ?

226
00:10:58,043 --> 00:10:59,345
Pax.

227
00:10:59,931 --> 00:11:01,396
Two more for ya.

228
00:11:02,636 --> 00:11:04,934
Hey, you remember a guy
who was in here a few weeks ago?

229
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:06,654
Uh, name was Leonard?

230
00:11:07,324 --> 00:11:09,228
No. Sorry.

231
00:11:11,516 --> 00:11:12,665
Follow me.

232
00:11:13,161 --> 00:11:14,299
Oh.

233
00:11:17,648 --> 00:11:18,782
So, how'd you guys find us?

234
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,420
Uh, a friend.

235
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:22,907
Did your, uh, friend say how we wager?

236
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:25,656
Yeah, listen, uh, money's
a little tight right now.

237
00:11:25,743 --> 00:11:27,386
Yeah,
we don't bet with money.

238
00:11:32,669 --> 00:11:34,092
We use this.

239
00:11:38,749 --> 00:11:40,678
Okay.
What are we looking at?

240
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,513
Go ahead.

241
00:11:44,193 --> 00:11:45,627
Touch it.

242
00:11:58,642 --> 00:11:59,856
Not great.

243
00:11:59,976 --> 00:12:01,287
Not the worst, either.

244
00:12:01,498 --> 00:12:02,608
And that means... ?

245
00:12:02,702 --> 00:12:04,227
Well, you see,
everybody walks in here

246
00:12:04,315 --> 00:12:06,246
with a certain amount of luck.

247
00:12:06,683 --> 00:12:08,088
That glow...

248
00:12:08,852 --> 00:12:10,304
that's you.

249
00:12:11,219 --> 00:12:12,752
About average.

250
00:12:14,444 --> 00:12:15,953
Yeah, that sounds about right.

251
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:19,878
But you set that coin
on... on that table,

252
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,842
you get yourself a game.

253
00:12:22,015 --> 00:12:23,294
And you win?

254
00:12:23,866 --> 00:12:26,114
You just might see
your fortune improve.

255
00:12:26,201 --> 00:12:27,672
And if he loses?

256
00:12:28,762 --> 00:12:30,486
Play again.
Have a good time.

257
00:12:30,573 --> 00:12:32,089
You know, keep playing.

258
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,896
But if the coin goes blank,
that means you're out of luck.

259
00:12:38,047 --> 00:12:39,359
You gotta leave.

260
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:41,625
Questions?

261
00:12:41,713 --> 00:12:42,686
Yeah.

262
00:12:42,774 --> 00:12:44,255
What is this place?

263
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:45,734
Who owns it?

264
00:12:45,821 --> 00:12:47,253
I just work here.

265
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,737
Look, if you don't like it,

266
00:12:50,864 --> 00:12:53,191
uh, the door's open.

267
00:12:54,431 --> 00:12:55,796
When I win,

268
00:12:56,297 --> 00:12:57,863
can I split it?

269
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,147
The luck?

270
00:13:00,234 --> 00:13:01,320
It's yours.

271
00:13:01,438 --> 00:13:02,583
You do what you want.

272
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,818
Yeah.

273
00:13:03,928 --> 00:13:06,294
Uh, just give us a second.
Thanks.

274
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,432
No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.
No way.

275
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,910
Man, I've been
slinging pool cues

276
00:13:11,998 --> 00:13:13,260
since before you were born.

277
00:13:13,347 --> 00:13:14,882
What? When you were 4?
Really?

278
00:13:14,969 --> 00:13:16,497
What, between nap time
and snack?

279
00:13:16,584 --> 00:13:19,066
Look, we barely made it out of
that monster fight club, okay?

280
00:13:19,153 --> 00:13:20,967
We need this.
And you know it.

281
00:13:21,756 --> 00:13:24,169
Now, look, you're better than me
at pretty much everything, okay?

282
00:13:24,256 --> 00:13:25,861
That's okay.
I'm not mad.

283
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:27,750
I'm proud.

284
00:13:28,626 --> 00:13:30,829
But I can wipe the floor
with you when it comes to pool.

285
00:13:35,739 --> 00:13:37,310
Good. Alright.

286
00:13:37,838 --> 00:13:40,582
Okay, pal,
let's give it a go.

287
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:24,717
I'm a Grigori.

288
00:14:24,805 --> 00:14:27,587
Each of our names
inscribed on our swords.

289
00:14:27,853 --> 00:14:30,874
A brotherhood of perfectly
crafted beings.

290
00:14:49,173 --> 00:14:52,009
So, how long are we supposed
to just wait around?

291
00:14:52,302 --> 00:14:54,202
You know,
if the fish aren't biting,

292
00:14:55,053 --> 00:14:56,529
throw 'em a little chum.

293
00:15:03,572 --> 00:15:04,953
I don't know, Sammy.

294
00:15:05,057 --> 00:15:06,858
I'm a little rusty.

295
00:15:22,527 --> 00:15:24,821
Go on. Rack 'Er up.

296
00:15:25,478 --> 00:15:27,148
Mm, yeah. Yeah.

297
00:15:30,461 --> 00:15:32,026
Decide not to play?

298
00:15:32,775 --> 00:15:34,657
Uh, yeah.
It's not really my thing.

299
00:15:34,776 --> 00:15:36,031
Hmm.

300
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,760
So, what's her deal?

301
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:50,458
Who? Moira?

302
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,192
Been here a while.

303
00:15:52,938 --> 00:15:54,909
Guess her sister's
still in a coma.

304
00:15:56,672 --> 00:15:59,342
So, she's playing
to wake her up?

305
00:15:59,953 --> 00:16:01,726
Everybody wants something.

306
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,529
Yeah.

307
00:16:07,917 --> 00:16:11,000
Hey, do you ever smell
anything weird,

308
00:16:11,087 --> 00:16:12,571
like rotten eggs,
or... ?

309
00:16:13,364 --> 00:16:14,444
Just Charlie.

310
00:16:16,295 --> 00:16:17,352
Right.

311
00:16:17,789 --> 00:16:19,067
What about...

312
00:16:19,155 --> 00:16:22,700
Have you ever noticed
little bundles laying around?

313
00:16:22,859 --> 00:16:24,741
Uh...no.

314
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:26,933
Look, you're new.

315
00:16:27,021 --> 00:16:31,276
I get it. You're trying
to figure this out.

316
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,779
I guess
it is pretty unbelievable.

317
00:16:34,211 --> 00:16:37,816
Places like this don't exist
for no reason.

318
00:16:38,366 --> 00:16:40,426
Most people think
it's a Godsend.

319
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,554
Take that guy.

320
00:16:43,928 --> 00:16:47,679
Loves his wife,
but she has expensive taste.

321
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,411
He came here
from Atlantic City,

322
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:51,285
not a dime left
to his name.

323
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,313
Or her...
Three kids, works doubles,

324
00:16:56,401 --> 00:16:58,105
buys a scratcher
every night.

325
00:16:58,697 --> 00:17:00,738
They both deserve
a lucky break.

326
00:17:01,248 --> 00:17:03,108
And they almost got one.

327
00:17:03,696 --> 00:17:06,905
They went on a streak,
could have walked away winners,

328
00:17:07,206 --> 00:17:09,829
but they kept on playing
till their luck went sour.

329
00:17:10,098 --> 00:17:12,061
They're not
actually winning?

330
00:17:12,785 --> 00:17:14,372
Not anymore.

331
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:18,225
Like I said,
they should have walked away.

332
00:17:44,353 --> 00:17:45,476
Damn it.

333
00:18:09,459 --> 00:18:12,676
Why are you
following me?

334
00:18:12,764 --> 00:18:14,378
It felt like a warning,
like...

335
00:18:14,466 --> 00:18:15,967
like she was telling me
to cut our losses.

336
00:18:16,055 --> 00:18:17,851
Come on, man.
I'm on a roll.

337
00:18:18,132 --> 00:18:19,580
Dean, you won one game.

338
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:22,013
Listen, I think this place
sucks you in, right?

339
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,448
And if you keep playing,
you'll lose.

340
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:24,782
And if you keep losing...

341
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:26,384
You go all Leonard.
Exactly.

342
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:28,152
Alright, so, we need
to minimize our risk

343
00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:30,525
and maximize our profit,
right?

344
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:33,247
It's kind of like that action
we took back in Tallahassee.

345
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,657
Remember that?
The... The... The "Fast Eddie"?

346
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,413
I don't remember.

347
00:18:38,501 --> 00:18:40,416
It was Dad's favorite,
from the movie.

348
00:18:40,504 --> 00:18:42,604
Paul Newman. "The Hustler."

349
00:18:44,397 --> 00:18:45,536
Alright, fine.

350
00:18:45,623 --> 00:18:47,668
One more game. One.

351
00:18:48,226 --> 00:18:49,487
Okay.

352
00:18:50,161 --> 00:18:52,317
Now we just gotta find
our Jackie Gleason.

353
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:10,065
What did you say
your name was again?

354
00:19:10,867 --> 00:19:12,623
Well,
my name's Dean Winchester.

355
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,086
And I'm gonna kick
your ass.

356
00:19:18,817 --> 00:19:23,034
Now, what kind of name
is, uh, Joey Six?

357
00:19:23,248 --> 00:19:25,963
Oh, it's just something they
used to call me back in PBR.

358
00:19:26,186 --> 00:19:27,861
Professional
bull riding circuit.

359
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,583
Nice.

360
00:19:33,243 --> 00:19:34,591
Tell me.

361
00:19:35,306 --> 00:19:36,911
How was that?

362
00:19:37,858 --> 00:19:39,334
Corner pocket.

363
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,644
Good times.

364
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,190
And some not so good.

365
00:20:15,355 --> 00:20:17,421
Double or nothing
says you miss that shot.

366
00:20:21,164 --> 00:20:23,313
You trying to hustle me,
Rodeo?

367
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,983
I thought you were gonna kick
my ass.

368
00:20:27,584 --> 00:20:29,183
Alright.

369
00:20:37,088 --> 00:20:38,563
Helluva shot.

370
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,811
Hey.

371
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:18,662
Good game.

372
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,388
Guess you can hustle
a hustler.

373
00:21:23,552 --> 00:21:25,050
Yeah,
I guess you can.

374
00:21:38,488 --> 00:21:40,176
Stay back.

375
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,317
Damn it.

376
00:21:46,486 --> 00:21:48,367
Let an old man go die in peace,
huh?

377
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,845
Wait, you're dying?

378
00:21:50,077 --> 00:21:51,584
Cancer.

379
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,992
I came out here
to beat it.

380
00:21:55,342 --> 00:21:57,542
I did win me
an extra year.

381
00:21:59,633 --> 00:22:01,341
Been saving this.

382
00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:21,938
Yeah, I liked that leathery
son of a bitch.

383
00:22:22,026 --> 00:22:23,507
Yeah, when he bet
double or nothing,

384
00:22:23,595 --> 00:22:24,558
you cleaned him out.

385
00:22:24,645 --> 00:22:26,326
Okay, well, plan worked.

386
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:27,512
Let's hit the road.

387
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,662
What about everybody else?

388
00:22:28,749 --> 00:22:30,097
Just give me some time,
alright?

389
00:22:30,184 --> 00:22:31,431
I-I need
to figure this out.

390
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:33,000
Dude, we're in a fight with God,
okay?

391
00:22:33,087 --> 00:22:35,769
And...we just got
our mojo back.

392
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:37,738
You really think
there's enough luck in that coin

393
00:22:37,825 --> 00:22:40,240
to make up
for whatever Chuck took from us?

394
00:22:40,327 --> 00:22:42,522
- Why don't I give it a whirl?
- How?

395
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,800
I'll go for a quick drive.
If Baby treats me right,

396
00:22:44,888 --> 00:22:45,911
then I know
we're out of the woods.

397
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:47,973
But when I get back,
it's adiós.

398
00:22:58,112 --> 00:23:01,695
Oh, uh,
Agent Liz-- Lizzo.

399
00:23:01,782 --> 00:23:02,852
Evans.

400
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,698
Hi.
Glad you came.

401
00:23:04,785 --> 00:23:06,033
Glad you called.

402
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,414
So, local transient
spotted our boy

403
00:23:08,502 --> 00:23:09,770
in some sort
of an altercation.

404
00:23:09,857 --> 00:23:10,937
Did they say
with whom?

405
00:23:11,024 --> 00:23:12,306
No.
She ran the other way

406
00:23:12,393 --> 00:23:15,309
when she saw the other guy
had a...sword.

407
00:23:15,396 --> 00:23:16,943
Looks like he used it.

408
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,419
Are there any abandoned
buildings in town?

409
00:23:19,507 --> 00:23:20,522
Yeah, I-I guess.

410
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:22,149
I mean, there's, uh,

411
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:23,884
plenty
of old cattle barns,

412
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:26,687
empty warehouses, old church,
that kind of thing.

413
00:23:26,774 --> 00:23:27,988
Church.
Where's the church?

414
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:30,383
Uh, two blocks down
on your right.

415
00:23:31,062 --> 00:23:32,272
Thank you.

416
00:23:33,043 --> 00:23:34,846
Uh, agent?

417
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,245
I called you
for answers.

418
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,664
I know.

419
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,573
And I intend
to find them.

420
00:23:40,945 --> 00:23:43,561
And then the Vikes
finally win the Super Bowl.

421
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:44,938
Right, that's great.
It is.

422
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:47,756
But is it really worth
your life?

423
00:23:48,788 --> 00:23:51,665
Look, man, just...
just one more game.

424
00:23:53,667 --> 00:23:55,090
Nice try.

425
00:23:56,303 --> 00:23:58,157
Too bad
no one will listen.

426
00:23:58,639 --> 00:24:00,439
None of us
are going anywhere.

427
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:04,654
Are they trapped here?

428
00:24:05,913 --> 00:24:07,213
Are you?

429
00:24:07,832 --> 00:24:11,544
Well, car's dead. Again.

430
00:24:11,767 --> 00:24:13,386
Didn't even make it
out of the parking lot.

431
00:24:13,474 --> 00:24:14,701
This coin...
blows.

432
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:16,036
I think you're right.

433
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:17,604
Didn't have enough juice.

434
00:24:17,691 --> 00:24:19,076
Hold on.

435
00:24:20,254 --> 00:24:21,453
No way.

436
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,878
At first, I thought maybe
these coins were...

437
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:26,713
were hexed or cursed.

438
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,181
Like the rabbit's foot.

439
00:24:28,268 --> 00:24:29,747
When you win, you're...
you're taking luck

440
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,084
from whoever you beat,
right?

441
00:24:31,171 --> 00:24:33,620
Right. But Joey Six beat
how many people?

442
00:24:33,707 --> 00:24:35,789
30? 40? More?

443
00:24:35,876 --> 00:24:38,439
All of that accumulated luck
should have been passed to you.

444
00:24:38,527 --> 00:24:39,626
Well, tell that to Baby.

445
00:24:39,713 --> 00:24:41,061
Exactly. It didn't.

446
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:43,522
Because what if
someone's stealing,

447
00:24:43,684 --> 00:24:45,571
every game,
skimming luck off the top?

448
00:24:45,888 --> 00:24:47,002
What... What do you mean?

449
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,134
Like, the house?

450
00:24:48,222 --> 00:24:50,422
Her. I think.

451
00:24:53,905 --> 00:24:56,146
"Atrox Fortuna"?

452
00:24:57,314 --> 00:24:58,911
She's the Roman Goddess
of Luck.

453
00:24:59,722 --> 00:25:01,448
Okay, say you're right.

454
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,983
What do we do?

455
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,184
I-I can't help you.

456
00:25:04,271 --> 00:25:05,355
I'm sorry.

457
00:25:05,484 --> 00:25:06,765
Then why warn me
in the first place?

458
00:25:06,853 --> 00:25:08,702
So you'd take your brother
and go.

459
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:10,289
Wait,
why are you here?

460
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,125
Does she have something
over you?

461
00:25:12,212 --> 00:25:13,417
I came to play.

462
00:25:13,505 --> 00:25:14,561
I lost.

463
00:25:14,648 --> 00:25:16,629
I'm only alive
'cause she lets me stay.

464
00:25:16,763 --> 00:25:18,092
Long as I keep working.

465
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,838
So, if you don't play yourself
to death,

466
00:25:19,926 --> 00:25:21,714
you work yourself to death.
Is that it?

467
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,184
Yeah, that's it.

468
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:24,779
Is she here?

469
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,106
I don't know.

470
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:27,783
I only talk to Pax.

471
00:25:31,098 --> 00:25:32,439
Her son.

472
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:40,931
You should heal that.

473
00:25:47,514 --> 00:25:49,313
I know what you are.

474
00:25:50,962 --> 00:25:52,268
You're powerful.

475
00:25:57,524 --> 00:25:58,799
Why not use it?

476
00:25:59,092 --> 00:26:00,506
Fight back?

477
00:26:07,516 --> 00:26:10,383
As a soldier,
I respect your silence,

478
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,886
tactically misguided
as it may be.

479
00:26:13,354 --> 00:26:15,006
For example,

480
00:26:15,764 --> 00:26:20,281
when I ask
why are you killing my kind,

481
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,101
you should answer

482
00:26:22,816 --> 00:26:24,507
so I won't hurt you.

483
00:26:34,828 --> 00:26:37,347
Why did you kill them?

484
00:26:38,065 --> 00:26:41,664
We Grigori have our own
frequency of angel radio.

485
00:26:42,378 --> 00:26:44,045
Did you know that?

486
00:26:45,047 --> 00:26:47,390
Before he died,
my brother called to me.

487
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:49,222
Did you want him to?

488
00:26:49,423 --> 00:26:51,139
To draw me out?

489
00:26:52,047 --> 00:26:53,984
Kill me, too?

490
00:26:58,031 --> 00:26:59,307
Pax.

491
00:26:59,686 --> 00:27:03,002
Hey, uh, can I ask you
a question?

492
00:27:04,857 --> 00:27:06,695
Where's your mom?

493
00:27:07,619 --> 00:27:09,222
Fortuna!

494
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:12,263
We have your son.

495
00:27:18,788 --> 00:27:20,187
Enough.

496
00:27:22,362 --> 00:27:23,920
Fortuna?

497
00:27:24,787 --> 00:27:26,178
That's one of my names.

498
00:27:26,305 --> 00:27:29,561
We know you're skimming luck
off what we won.

499
00:27:29,683 --> 00:27:30,967
We want it back.

500
00:27:31,218 --> 00:27:32,921
Or I kill him.

501
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,434
Well, you probably could.

502
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,570
His daddy was human.
But, no.

503
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:38,006
Mom.

504
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:39,771
I'm sorry, baby.

505
00:27:40,106 --> 00:27:41,972
I can always make
more sons.

506
00:27:47,223 --> 00:27:48,495
Then play me for it.

507
00:27:48,691 --> 00:27:49,972
I played you already.

508
00:27:50,203 --> 00:27:51,616
Then we go again.

509
00:27:51,772 --> 00:27:54,779
When I play someone,
I get a read on them.

510
00:27:55,242 --> 00:27:56,439
And you...

511
00:27:57,544 --> 00:27:59,505
you're just a beach read.

512
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,061
Sexy, mm,

513
00:28:01,148 --> 00:28:02,562
but skimmable.

514
00:28:02,649 --> 00:28:04,082
Beach read?

515
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:06,759
Lady, I'm Tolstoy.

516
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,694
That's very funny.

517
00:28:10,339 --> 00:28:14,319
This one here...
He could be interesting.

518
00:28:14,494 --> 00:28:16,176
Wait. No, no, no.

519
00:28:16,263 --> 00:28:18,078
That's... Unh-unh.

520
00:28:18,308 --> 00:28:19,626
Fine.

521
00:28:21,104 --> 00:28:22,446
Yeah, I'll play.

522
00:28:25,272 --> 00:28:26,880
But not for our luck.

523
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:30,123
I'll play for the lives
of everybody in here.

524
00:28:32,446 --> 00:28:33,649
No.

525
00:28:33,747 --> 00:28:34,961
Only for your luck.

526
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:37,463
And if you lose,
I get your lives.

527
00:28:39,609 --> 00:28:41,380
Come on,
you threatened my baby,

528
00:28:41,955 --> 00:28:43,398
my livelihood.

529
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,433
An example must be made.

530
00:28:45,859 --> 00:28:49,461
So ... are you in?

531
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:04,491
You can't kill me.

532
00:29:04,578 --> 00:29:06,208
I can make you
uffer.

533
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,795
You killed
the last of my kind.

534
00:29:08,931 --> 00:29:10,600
You ate their hearts!

535
00:29:12,986 --> 00:29:16,194
This is more than fair.

536
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:18,839
Fair?

537
00:29:20,318 --> 00:29:24,950
The last one I killed
was pretending to be a doctor.

538
00:29:29,639 --> 00:29:34,548
Feeding on the souls of humans
he was supposed to heal.

539
00:29:36,256 --> 00:29:37,733
You do it, too.

540
00:29:39,404 --> 00:29:41,404
Only you like children.

541
00:29:54,594 --> 00:29:56,077
Who told you that?

542
00:29:56,996 --> 00:29:58,328
Death.

543
00:30:25,492 --> 00:30:27,012
Jack?

544
00:30:57,329 --> 00:30:59,240
Guess that makes me
solids.

545
00:31:18,062 --> 00:31:20,729
So, why do you need this luck
so bad?

546
00:31:20,965 --> 00:31:22,660
Girlfriend problems?

547
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,527
Liver failure?

548
00:31:27,395 --> 00:31:28,962
Accursed by God.

549
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:35,006
Life's a bitch,
then you die.

550
00:31:35,147 --> 00:31:38,288
The God...literally
cursed us.

551
00:31:38,461 --> 00:31:39,542
You've met?

552
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:40,978
Yeah.

553
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,103
Little guy,
squirrelly as hell.

554
00:31:44,221 --> 00:31:45,709
Yeah, that's him.

555
00:31:48,718 --> 00:31:52,635
Well ...
welcome to the club.

556
00:31:52,889 --> 00:31:54,153
The club?

557
00:31:58,177 --> 00:31:59,763
Yes, the club.

558
00:32:00,438 --> 00:32:01,567
God created the world,

559
00:32:01,655 --> 00:32:03,616
but you know
who created us gods?

560
00:32:04,008 --> 00:32:06,127
You did. You humans.

561
00:32:07,878 --> 00:32:09,122
Sort of.

562
00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:15,172
When you apes first climbed down
from the trees,

563
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,306
you didn't pray to him.
You prayed to the...

564
00:32:17,556 --> 00:32:22,107
the sun, the womb, the rain,
and the stars.

565
00:32:22,393 --> 00:32:26,377
Well, at first,
the creator was furious.

566
00:32:26,464 --> 00:32:30,440
How dare you not recognize
his beneficence?

567
00:32:33,553 --> 00:32:36,569
But soon enough,
he birthed us...

568
00:32:36,807 --> 00:32:41,736
Ra, Anu, Hera, Mixcoatl,

569
00:32:41,946 --> 00:32:43,143
all the rest.

570
00:32:43,381 --> 00:32:44,747
Why?

571
00:32:45,551 --> 00:32:46,939
Why?

572
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,611
Why?

573
00:32:54,051 --> 00:32:55,499
To take the blame.

574
00:32:55,587 --> 00:32:56,801
Bad harvest?

575
00:32:56,889 --> 00:32:58,271
Stillborn child?

576
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:00,486
Our bad. Not his.

577
00:33:01,425 --> 00:33:03,340
Plus, we made
for epic stories.

578
00:33:03,467 --> 00:33:06,750
But his ego could only
handle that for so long.

579
00:33:07,025 --> 00:33:10,585
Now he's happy
to hide behind whatever religion

580
00:33:10,941 --> 00:33:12,769
has the best
syndication deal.

581
00:33:13,177 --> 00:33:15,559
While we survive on scraps
in the wilderness.

582
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,581
Most gods,
they're forgotten.

583
00:33:22,015 --> 00:33:23,830
But I'm old.

584
00:33:23,988 --> 00:33:25,520
I hold a grudge.

585
00:33:33,529 --> 00:33:34,543
Oh, well.

586
00:33:34,741 --> 00:33:36,190
What are you gonna do?

587
00:33:36,887 --> 00:33:38,645
We're gonna fight him.

588
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:40,752
Are you, now?!

589
00:33:40,949 --> 00:33:42,230
And when you lose...?

590
00:33:42,373 --> 00:33:44,104
Sam: We lose swinging.

591
00:33:45,209 --> 00:33:47,019
Eight ball,
corner pocket.

592
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:02,900
You little minx.

593
00:34:03,027 --> 00:34:04,633
You got me talking.

594
00:34:05,698 --> 00:34:06,834
You're good.

595
00:34:07,387 --> 00:34:08,868
I learned
from my brother.

596
00:34:09,066 --> 00:34:11,649
Alright,
you know the deal.

597
00:34:12,076 --> 00:34:13,779
Even up.

598
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,703
What do you say
we make it interesting?

599
00:34:18,254 --> 00:34:20,309
Okay?
You're gonna fight God.

600
00:34:20,615 --> 00:34:23,264
That's the stuff of heroes,
right?

601
00:34:23,414 --> 00:34:26,045
So, you're gonna need
the luck of heroes...

602
00:34:26,133 --> 00:34:28,949
Hercules, Cuchulain,
Gilgamesh.

603
00:34:29,037 --> 00:34:30,118
I helped them all.

604
00:34:30,206 --> 00:34:31,954
I can help you, too.

605
00:34:32,156 --> 00:34:33,727
What's the catch?

606
00:34:34,425 --> 00:34:36,254
Another game.
Double or nothing.

607
00:34:36,468 --> 00:34:37,916
Double.

608
00:34:38,162 --> 00:34:39,814
That's how
the cowboy died.

609
00:34:51,331 --> 00:34:52,892
Yeah.

610
00:34:53,777 --> 00:34:54,957
Deal.

611
00:34:57,014 --> 00:34:59,041
But not for more luck.

612
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,526
For them.

613
00:35:01,931 --> 00:35:03,290
If I win,

614
00:35:03,821 --> 00:35:05,206
you have to let them go.

615
00:35:05,492 --> 00:35:07,574
Honey,
I'm not stopping them.

616
00:35:07,725 --> 00:35:09,599
<i>Okay, then when I win,</i>

617
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,975
you have to give back
the luck you stole.

618
00:35:13,146 --> 00:35:14,227
Close up shop.

619
00:35:14,322 --> 00:35:15,717
What is with you
and these loser?

620
00:35:15,805 --> 00:35:17,120
They're nothing!

621
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:18,910
They don't matter.

622
00:35:24,734 --> 00:35:26,100
They matter to me.

623
00:35:26,386 --> 00:35:27,919
They matter to us.

624
00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:37,137
Well, fine.

625
00:35:37,313 --> 00:35:39,046
Rack 'em up.

626
00:36:25,896 --> 00:36:27,665
Eight ball,
corner pocket.

627
00:36:50,227 --> 00:36:53,002
You challenged the Goddess of Luck
in her own joint.

628
00:36:53,222 --> 00:36:54,956
What did you think
was gonna happen?

629
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:57,538
Well, we had to try.

630
00:36:57,892 --> 00:36:59,959
Well, that was stupid.

631
00:37:15,013 --> 00:37:16,546
Thought
she was gonna kill us.

632
00:37:18,691 --> 00:37:20,206
Yeah,
she doesn't have to.

633
00:37:20,445 --> 00:37:22,562
Our luck will do that
on its own.

634
00:37:23,494 --> 00:37:25,108
Dean,
we can't just...

635
00:37:25,195 --> 00:37:27,289
- Just leave them.
- No. I know.

636
00:37:28,532 --> 00:37:30,113
Alright, well,
let's go find some Wi-Fi

637
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,476
and see
what kills Lady Luck.

638
00:37:31,597 --> 00:37:33,263
Then we'll circle back.

639
00:37:38,334 --> 00:37:40,315
Hey.
What... What's going on?

640
00:37:40,403 --> 00:37:41,916
What happened?
-She...

641
00:37:42,362 --> 00:37:43,957
She shut it down.

642
00:37:44,325 --> 00:37:45,873
- What?!
- Why?

643
00:37:46,007 --> 00:37:47,229
Because of you.

644
00:37:47,684 --> 00:37:50,303
She said she thought your kind
had gone extinct.

645
00:37:50,421 --> 00:37:51,756
Our kind?

646
00:37:52,177 --> 00:37:53,806
Heroes.

647
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:55,538
Like the old days.

648
00:37:56,213 --> 00:37:58,375
And, uh,
she gave me a message.

649
00:37:58,595 --> 00:38:01,171
She said,
"Don't play his game.

650
00:38:01,267 --> 00:38:03,206
Make him play
yours."

651
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:42,309
Come on.

652
00:38:54,894 --> 00:38:56,561
We're back, baby!

653
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,815
Alright, this is it.
Last scratcher.

654
00:39:10,608 --> 00:39:12,174
Come on, come on.

655
00:39:14,707 --> 00:39:16,167
What the hell?!

656
00:39:16,341 --> 00:39:19,591
I mean, so much for
that "Luck of Hercules" crap.

657
00:39:19,686 --> 00:39:21,635
So, we didn't win
the lottery.

658
00:39:21,722 --> 00:39:23,003
But no car trouble.

659
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:24,908
Uh, credit cards work.

660
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:27,384
Oh, and back-to-back
bacon double cheeseburgers

661
00:39:27,472 --> 00:39:28,642
didn't kill you, so...

662
00:39:28,729 --> 00:39:30,006
That was beautiful,
by the way.

663
00:39:30,094 --> 00:39:31,388
I'm just saying
would it have killed her

664
00:39:31,476 --> 00:39:32,879
to give us
a little extra?

665
00:39:32,966 --> 00:39:34,781
Well, she thinks
we're real heroes.

666
00:39:34,868 --> 00:39:36,361
Maybe they don't get
all the shortcuts.

667
00:39:36,449 --> 00:39:38,150
Friggin' gods, man.

668
00:39:40,034 --> 00:39:41,149
Cass?

669
00:39:41,275 --> 00:39:42,319
Hey.

670
00:39:42,542 --> 00:39:43,829
Everything okay?

671
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,339
Hello.

672
00:39:52,318 --> 00:39:53,912
Jack?

673
00:39:55,621 --> 00:39:57,311
It's really him.

674
00:40:21,799 --> 00:40:24,681
Jack, you...
you ate their hearts?

675
00:40:24,793 --> 00:40:26,787
I...had to.

676
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:31,413
And you let him?

677
00:40:34,695 --> 00:40:36,536
You could have called us.

678
00:40:37,905 --> 00:40:40,731
Every day I wanted to come home,
but...

679
00:40:41,654 --> 00:40:43,042
..I couldn't.

680
00:40:43,303 --> 00:40:44,618
Why not?

681
00:40:44,934 --> 00:40:46,886
Because if I don't
stay hidden,

682
00:40:47,032 --> 00:40:48,955
if I use my powers,
my grandfather...

683
00:40:49,042 --> 00:40:50,457
he'll know I'm back,

684
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,820
and he'll try
and kill me...

685
00:40:53,513 --> 00:40:54,948
again.

686
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,437
He's afraid of me.

687
00:41:01,455 --> 00:41:03,481
And that's why
we had to wait.

688
00:41:06,015 --> 00:41:08,923
Billie kept him hidden
in the Empty

689
00:41:09,129 --> 00:41:10,846
until Chuck
went off world.

690
00:41:11,064 --> 00:41:12,886
She let me out
when it was safe.

691
00:41:13,421 --> 00:41:15,315
Safe to what?
Eat a bunch of angel hearts?

692
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,463
Safe to do
what I have to.

693
00:41:18,538 --> 00:41:20,966
The hearts,
they were just the beginning.

694
00:41:21,341 --> 00:41:23,954
They made me strong,
but I-I'm not strong enough.

695
00:41:24,042 --> 00:41:25,480
I...

696
00:41:26,497 --> 00:41:28,617
If I do
exactly what she says,

697
00:41:28,705 --> 00:41:30,437
if I follow her plan,

698
00:41:31,051 --> 00:41:33,162
then I'll get stronger

699
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,449
and...

700
00:41:37,197 --> 00:41:39,231
I'll be able
to kill God.

701

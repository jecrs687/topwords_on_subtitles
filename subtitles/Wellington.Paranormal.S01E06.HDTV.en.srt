First up, congratulations
to Donovan and Lopepe.

5
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,400
They responded to reports
from residents in Hataitai

6
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,920
who reported hearing gunfire
and responded immediately.

Kia or a. just some kids
throwing marbles at a shed, sir.

8
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,580

still went in without hesitation.

And we've also got a card
for Constable Parker,

10
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,240
who responded to a call-out about kids throwing
marbles in Khandallah and ended up getting shot.

11

Hope you get better soon, e hoa.

And lastly, earlier today I noticed
a few personal items of mine went

13
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,360
missing from the
police kitchen fridge.

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,620
Namely, four jam doughnuts
made for me by my nana.

15
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,360
She's 92. She doesn't have a lot of
jam doughnuts left in her, yeah.

16
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,360
My name was clearly written
on the side of the box.

17
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,130
Maaka - written in marker.

18
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:27,320
If those doughnuts aren't back in that fridge by
the end of the shift, I'm docking everybody's pay.

be careful out there.

Why? Why are you sorry? Huh?

25
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,600
Did you take them?
No, I'm just sorry someone else did.

I'll detect if you took them.

32

like her anyway.

antagonise the zomb- the officers,

330
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,960
Do the sprinkler.

331
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,740
That's a good sprinkler.

Oh.

335
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,580
Re-enact the boat scene
from the Titanic.

339
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,050
Let's all look like zombies.

340
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,240
Let's all look surprised!

Freeze!

344
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,020
OK, handcuff each other and escort
each other to the police station.

345
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,740
The undead persons that we brought into the
station are now being processed by the courts.

346
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:05,240
So they're no longer our problem. That's
right, and as for the infected officers,

347
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,100
they've obviously been given desk jobs,
so they're still dealing with the public,

348
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,860
but it's from a safe distance.

349
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:13,880
No, you were speeding, so you have
to pay that ticket. (GRUNTS)

350
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,720
No, you've got a ticket.
You just have to pay the fine, yeah.

351
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,490
Yeah, it's, uh- lt's- lt's-

352
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,790
(GROANS) $250.

353
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,740
It's obviously a bit
noisier in the office,

354
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,540
but I mean- I think, actually, to be
honest, they seem like a better pair now.

355
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:33,100
I think they really, they really do a good job
on the desk. They're really great, aren't they?

356
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,420
That's important to have officers
that can do that job.

357
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:38,970
I mean, all in all,
we managed to contain the outbreak,

358
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,740
so society's not going to
break down just yet.

359
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,190
Good result for the Paranormal Unit.

2
00:10:11,443 --> 00:10:13,360
I thought you were dead.

3
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,466
This is what was causing all the fuss?

4
00:10:35,342 --> 00:10:37,175
I think it's a child.

5
00:10:37,177 --> 00:10:39,946
It is better to deliver it alive then.

6
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:43,306
My ship has
been destroyed. I'm trapped here.

7
00:10:43,308 --> 00:10:45,894
Stripped. Not destroyed.

8
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:51,064
The Jawas steal. They don't destroy.

9
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:54,361
Stolen or
destroyed, makes no difference to me.

10
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,155
They're protected by
their crawling fortress.

11
00:10:59,157 --> 00:11:01,783
There's no way to recover the parts.

12
00:11:01,785 --> 00:11:03,326
You can trade.

13
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:05,870
With Jawas?
Are you out of your mind?

14
00:11:05,872 --> 00:11:07,332
I will take you to them.

15
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,334
I have spoken.

16
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,631
Hey! Spit that out.

17
00:11:56,157 --> 00:11:58,235
_

18
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:10,644
They really
don't like you for some reason.

19
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,657
Well, I did
disintegrate a few of them.

20
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,759
You need to drop your rifle.

21
00:12:22,762 --> 00:12:24,290
I'm a Mandalorian.

22
00:12:24,293 --> 00:12:26,075
Weapons are part of my religion.

23
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,353
Then you are not
getting your parts back.

24
00:12:31,775 --> 00:12:32,960
Fine.

25
00:12:43,887 --> 00:12:45,222
And the blaster.

26
00:12:49,806 --> 00:12:51,184
Good day.

27
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:19,087
They will trade
all the parts for the beskar.

28
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,631
I'm not gonna trade
anything. These are my parts.

29
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:23,008
They stole them from me.

30
00:13:24,731 --> 00:13:27,511
_

31
00:13:28,715 --> 00:13:30,016
_

32
00:13:30,134 --> 00:13:32,016
_

33
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,852
- You understand this?
- No!

34
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:36,607
Whoa. Easy, easy.

35
00:13:40,342 --> 00:13:43,070
_

36
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,699
_

37
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,117
Get away from it!

38
00:13:51,635 --> 00:13:53,563
_

39
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,813
_

40
00:14:04,297 --> 00:14:06,429
The egg? What egg?

41
00:14:06,432 --> 00:14:09,328
_

42
00:14:11,394 --> 00:14:16,367
_

43
00:20:50,956 --> 00:20:53,203
_

44
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:56,906
_

45
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,523
Mando!

46
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,692
I have it.

47
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,443
I've got the egg.

48
00:22:11,828 --> 00:22:13,953
I'm surprised you waited.

49
00:22:13,956 --> 00:22:16,751
I'm surprised you took so long.

50
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:36,521
Is it still sleeping?

51
00:22:39,148 --> 00:22:40,567
Yes.

52
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,613
Was it injured?

53
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:50,742
I don't
think so. Not physically.

54
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:53,242
Explain it to me again.

55
00:22:53,245 --> 00:22:56,273
I still don't understand what happened.

56
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,002
Neither do I.

57
00:23:06,436 --> 00:23:08,176
There's no way we're
gonna get this to work

58
00:23:08,177 --> 00:23:10,577
without a full maintenance facility.

59
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,789
This is gonna take days to fix.

60
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:15,773
If you care to help, it might go faster.

61
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,147
There is much work to do.

62
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,426
I can't thank you enough.

63
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:34,273
Please allow me to give
you a portion of the reward.

64
00:24:34,276 --> 00:24:36,388
I cannot accept.

65
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:40,612
You are my guest and I am
therefore in your service.

66
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:49,523
I could use a crew member of your
ability, and I can pay handsomely.

67
00:24:49,526 --> 00:24:51,238
I am honored,

68
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,700
but I have worked a lifetime
to finally be free of servitude.

69
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:57,134
I understand.

70
00:24:57,137 --> 00:24:59,496
Then all I can offer is my thanks.

71
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,373
And I offer mine.

72
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:04,002
Thank you for bringing
peace to my valley.

73
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,851
And good luck with The Child.

74
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:25,148
May it survive and bring
you a handsome reward.

75
00:25:26,766 --> 00:25:28,068
I have spoken.

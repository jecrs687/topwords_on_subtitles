1
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,819
It's okay.

2
00:00:36,862 --> 00:00:38,429
It's okay.Mom.

3
00:00:38,473 --> 00:00:41,432
It's okay, honey.
I got you.

4
00:00:55,664 --> 00:00:58,188
It's your third
nightmare this week.

5
00:00:58,232 --> 00:01:00,103
Fourth.
But who's counting?

6
00:01:00,147 --> 00:01:02,062
Good morning, ladies.

7
00:01:02,105 --> 00:01:03,846
I'm sorry, Dad.

8
00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:05,978
It's okay, pumpkin.

9
00:01:06,022 --> 00:01:08,155
Sleep's overrated.

10
00:01:10,026 --> 00:01:12,724
I think we need
to go see somebody.

11
00:01:12,768 --> 00:01:14,857
A psychiatrist?

12
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,989
A counselor.
Somebody to help you get over it.

13
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:20,254
Dad. Mom. No.

14
00:01:20,297 --> 00:01:22,821
It's been two years.

15
00:01:22,865 --> 00:01:25,302
I'm not going to a psychiatrist.

16
00:01:25,346 --> 00:01:28,088
Well, we have to do something.

17
00:01:28,131 --> 00:01:29,698
Yeah, we do need
to do something.

18
00:01:29,741 --> 00:01:32,135
We need to put that man in jail.

19
00:01:32,179 --> 00:01:36,008
Sophie. How many times
have we talked about this?

20
00:01:36,052 --> 00:01:37,880
You gotta let it go.

21
00:01:37,923 --> 00:01:39,099
Let it go.

22
00:01:39,142 --> 00:01:41,884
How can I let it go
after what he did to me?

23
00:01:41,927 --> 00:01:45,148
There is nothing we can do.

24
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:46,758
I know it's not right,

25
00:01:46,802 --> 00:01:49,892
but sometimes bad people,
they just... they get away with it.

26
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:08,171
I really want this to work.

27
00:02:08,215 --> 00:02:11,000
I do too.

28
00:02:11,043 --> 00:02:15,831
I know we haven't talked
about everything yet.

29
00:02:16,962 --> 00:02:18,181
What do you mean?

30
00:02:18,225 --> 00:02:19,574
There are some things in my past

31
00:02:19,617 --> 00:02:22,577
that you don't know about,

32
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,189
and I'm sure there are things
about you that I don't know about.

33
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:27,495
Right? Right.

34
00:02:27,538 --> 00:02:29,758
Well,

35
00:02:29,801 --> 00:02:32,152
it's been
three months now, and...

36
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:38,114
If we're gonna have a life together,
we shouldn't have any secrets.

37
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:40,986
Hey.

38
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,814
No matter what you tell me,

39
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:44,990
I'm not gonna stop loving you.

40
00:02:47,384 --> 00:02:50,213
Okay. I'll go first.

41
00:02:50,257 --> 00:02:53,782
When I was in college,

42
00:02:53,825 --> 00:02:57,655
I was... in love with a woman.

43
00:02:59,048 --> 00:03:03,095
It was just a phase
I was going through, and...

44
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:04,401
Well, I was thinking

45
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:08,275
that maybe you and I might...

46
00:03:10,755 --> 00:03:13,062
share a woman for a night.

47
00:03:14,106 --> 00:03:16,283
If that's okay.

48
00:03:16,326 --> 00:03:18,850
If that's what you want.

49
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:21,157
I would do it for you.

50
00:03:22,637 --> 00:03:26,118
Okay, that's my terrible past.
Your turn.

51
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:29,121
Well...

52
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:32,821
About a year ago,

53
00:03:32,864 --> 00:03:35,432
I was involved in a court case.

54
00:03:35,476 --> 00:03:37,086
Malpractice?

55
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:39,567
You could say that.

56
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,178
They accused me of terrible things.

57
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,746
They were trying to send
me to jail for a long time,

58
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:48,663
but I managed to persuade one
of the jurors to see it my way,

59
00:03:48,706 --> 00:03:51,294
and she convinced everybody else
on the jury that I was innocent.

60
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:54,886
The court finds
Dr. Albert Beck not guilty.

61
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,845
Everything's okay now though.

62
00:03:56,888 --> 00:03:59,108
It's all in the past.

63
00:03:59,151 --> 00:04:01,502
What did... What did
they accuse you of?

64
00:04:01,545 --> 00:04:04,287
It's... It's not important, baby.

65
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:06,289
Hey, come on.

66
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,335
No secrets, remember?

67
00:04:12,339 --> 00:04:15,777
Kidnapping and attempted murder.

68
00:04:17,344 --> 00:04:22,827
That... doesn't sound
like malpractice.

69
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:25,134
Well, it was complicated.

70
00:04:25,177 --> 00:04:28,180
Car accident.
This woman comes in the ER.

71
00:04:28,224 --> 00:04:30,748
We operate on her heart
for, like, eight hours.

72
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:32,315
She had a real dicey recovery,

73
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:35,013
and she needed a doctor
to look after her 24/7.

74
00:04:35,057 --> 00:04:39,279
And the only place I could really
look after her was at my house.

75
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:43,718
Well, the police took her side
in the matter. It was so silly.

76
00:04:43,761 --> 00:04:46,808
Like I said, it was all
just a big misunderstanding.

77
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,205
Gosh.
Look what time it is.

78
00:04:53,249 --> 00:04:55,164
I'm gonna be late
for that meeting.

79
00:04:55,207 --> 00:04:58,385
Baby, I don't make mistakes
like that anymore.

80
00:04:58,428 --> 00:05:00,343
I'm not even practicing
medicine anymore.

81
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:02,171
I'm gonna be
a college professor.

82
00:05:02,214 --> 00:05:03,390
I know.

83
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:06,044
I will call you.

84
00:05:06,088 --> 00:05:09,613
You, said you'd love me
no matter what I told you.

85
00:05:13,051 --> 00:05:15,097
You lied to me.

86
00:05:20,015 --> 00:05:22,060
You know what I'm gonna do?

87
00:05:22,104 --> 00:05:24,802
I'm gonna make it so you
can't tell any more lies.

88
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:26,195
I'm gonna cut your tongue out.

89
00:05:26,238 --> 00:05:29,459
Who are you kidding?
No, you won't.

90
00:05:29,503 --> 00:05:31,766
She deserves it. No, she doesn't.

91
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:34,334
You heard what she said.
She said she'd love me unconditionally.

92
00:05:34,377 --> 00:05:36,988
- Who are you talking to?
- She said the past didn't matter,

93
00:05:37,032 --> 00:05:38,990
that we had a future together.

94
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:41,341
Dude, you need
to take your pill.

95
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:42,994
I loved her!

96
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:44,431
Pill.

97
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:13,503
Sophie,
you ready to hit the road?

98
00:06:13,547 --> 00:06:16,158
Yeah, Dad. Give me five.

99
00:06:18,943 --> 00:06:20,423
All right.

100
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:22,425
A little something
in case you need it.

101
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:23,513
Dad.

102
00:06:23,557 --> 00:06:25,036
Come on, honey.
Take it.

103
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,474
Sometimes the food they
serve at the dorm is awful.

104
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:29,824
You said so yourself.
That way if you're hungry,

105
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:32,106
you can walk down to the village
and get some dinner, right?

106
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,481
Okay. I'm not gonna use it.

107
00:06:34,524 --> 00:06:37,005
Here's your clothes,
fresh from the laundry.

108
00:06:37,048 --> 00:06:38,485
Thanks, Mom.

109
00:06:38,528 --> 00:06:41,183
And speaking of money,

110
00:06:41,226 --> 00:06:43,707
are you sure we're all paid
up for tuition this semester?

111
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:45,666
Yeah, we are.'Cause I don't remember

112
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:47,668
getting a bill from Whittendale.

113
00:06:47,711 --> 00:06:49,626
Honey, did you? No.

114
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,237
No, no. I thought
you took care of it. Mom, Dad, relax.

115
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:54,892
They wouldn't enroll me in
classes if we weren't paid up.

116
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:55,980
We're fine.

117
00:06:56,024 --> 00:06:57,286
All right.

118
00:06:57,329 --> 00:06:59,244
Okay, I wanna get going
so I won't hit traffic.

119
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:00,811
I got it.Dad.

120
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:03,727
I'm a big girl.
I can carry my own suitcase.

121
00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:05,163
Yes, ma'am.

122
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:11,039
Call us when you get
to Whittendale. I will.

123
00:07:11,082 --> 00:07:12,344
Drive safe.

124
00:07:12,388 --> 00:07:14,477
I always do.

125
00:07:14,521 --> 00:07:16,566
Love you, honey. Be careful.

126
00:07:34,715 --> 00:07:37,761
You're looking at a doctor who
cares deeply for his fellow man,

127
00:07:37,805 --> 00:07:40,590
and I'm excited to have him
join us here on campus.

128
00:07:40,634 --> 00:07:44,507
When he was chairman of the president's
task force on heart disease,

129
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:46,335
he single-handedly
revolutionized

130
00:07:46,378 --> 00:07:49,381
the way the world approaches
cardiovascular surgery.

131
00:07:49,425 --> 00:07:52,036
And now, as dean
of the medical department,

132
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,127
it is my sincere pleasure
to introduce to you

133
00:07:56,171 --> 00:07:57,694
your new instructor
for this semester,

134
00:07:57,738 --> 00:08:00,349
Dr. Albert Beck.

135
00:08:02,046 --> 00:08:03,787
You're too generous.

136
00:08:05,746 --> 00:08:08,357
So, um...

137
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,532
Hi.

138
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:11,447
Hi.

139
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,362
Welcome to,

140
00:08:13,405 --> 00:08:15,582
Cardiological...

141
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:19,063
Cardiological Systems 101-B.

142
00:08:19,107 --> 00:08:21,196
Strange name for a class.

143
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:23,198
Excuse me.

144
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,550
It seems to fit
the... the material

145
00:08:27,594 --> 00:08:29,639
that we'll be discussing
this semester.

146
00:08:45,481 --> 00:08:46,656
Ooh.

147
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:53,445
Yes.

148
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:55,230
I read about you
on the Internet.

149
00:08:55,273 --> 00:08:57,014
Did you kidnap that girl?

150
00:08:58,276 --> 00:08:59,539
What's your name?

151
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:00,888
Victoria.

152
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:02,846
Victoria.

153
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:07,459
Victoria, if what you read
on the Internet were true,

154
00:09:07,503 --> 00:09:10,375
do you think this great
university would have hired me?

155
00:09:11,246 --> 00:09:13,640
Probably not. Of course not.

156
00:09:13,683 --> 00:09:16,120
A lot of doctors are wrongfully
accused in this country.

157
00:09:16,164 --> 00:09:18,209
Malpractice is very common.

158
00:09:18,253 --> 00:09:22,126
It's also something that all of you may have
to deal with once you start practicing.

159
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,128
Am I right? Absolutely.

160
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,095
And on that note,
the first thing I'd like to teach you guys

161
00:09:34,138 --> 00:09:37,272
is that I'll run this class the
same way I run an operating room.

162
00:09:37,315 --> 00:09:39,274
It doesn't matter
if you're a nurse

163
00:09:39,317 --> 00:09:41,929
or an anesthesiologist
or the chief surgeon.

164
00:09:41,972 --> 00:09:43,844
You will arrive on time.

165
00:09:43,887 --> 00:09:45,628
What's your name?

166
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,025
Melissa... Melissa Peterson.

167
00:09:51,068 --> 00:09:53,244
It is such an honor
to meet you, Dr. Beck.

168
00:09:53,288 --> 00:09:56,726
I am so sorry I'm late.
I ran all the way from the...

169
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,641
Easy. Easy.

170
00:09:58,685 --> 00:10:00,251
Baby. Ooh.

171
00:10:00,295 --> 00:10:02,384
Whoa. Easy.
What's happening?

172
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:07,128
Okay, don't worry.
She just fainted.

173
00:10:09,173 --> 00:10:10,740
Has this ever happened
to you before?

174
00:10:10,784 --> 00:10:14,309
Like when you stand up too
fast, or you're grossed out?

175
00:10:14,352 --> 00:10:15,440
Yeah.

176
00:10:15,484 --> 00:10:18,139
It sounds like she
has vasovagal syncope.

177
00:10:18,182 --> 00:10:19,706
When the vagus nerve
is overstimulated,

178
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:23,187
your blood vessels dilate
and your heart slows down.

179
00:10:23,231 --> 00:10:26,147
It happens to a lot of people.
You'll be fine.

180
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,674
Thank you. Okay.

181
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,114
God.

182
00:10:37,158 --> 00:10:39,029
I'm so embarrassed.

183
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:40,944
Don't be.

184
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:03,793
You shouldn't be doing this.

185
00:11:06,143 --> 00:11:07,971
This doesn't concern you.Man.

186
00:11:08,015 --> 00:11:11,322
You really think you can be normal,
don't ya? Teaching job. Mansion.

187
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:14,586
Sports car. Hot chick
to round out the package.

188
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,981
- Shut up and leave me alone.
- I'm not gonna leave you alone.

189
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:20,767
'Cause you got a big-ass problem
and you don't see it.

190
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:23,465
All right, Mr. Smart Guy,
what's my problem? Younger women.

191
00:11:23,508 --> 00:11:25,380
They're poison to you.

192
00:11:25,423 --> 00:11:28,296
Well, then how come they're so
much nicer to me than older women?

193
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:31,386
Because you're so old,
the younger women think you're harmless.

194
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:34,041
They don't know you're just
really a dirty old man.

195
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:35,695
That's not true, man.

196
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:39,220
When I fall in love with a girl,
it's for real. It is honest.

197
00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:44,312
Honest. Yeah, right. Is that why
you're out in the middle of the night

198
00:11:44,355 --> 00:11:46,706
following Melissa around
with a camera?

199
00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:48,142
'Cause you're so honest?

200
00:11:48,185 --> 00:11:50,144
I'm not having
this conversation.

201
00:11:50,187 --> 00:11:51,928
- Delete the photos.
- No!

202
00:11:51,972 --> 00:11:54,539
And stay away from her, man.

203
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,150
Stay away from all women.

204
00:11:56,193 --> 00:11:58,761
It's the only way you're
gonna keep out of trouble, pal.

205
00:11:58,805 --> 00:12:03,070
So what am I supposed to do, live the rest
of my life alone, with no one to love?

206
00:12:03,113 --> 00:12:04,375
That's the deal.

207
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:06,769
Well, the deal stinks. Sure does.

208
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:09,032
But it beats
the hell out of prison.

209
00:12:12,122 --> 00:12:13,733
Man.

210
00:12:20,522 --> 00:12:22,829
You know,
what happened to that guy?

211
00:12:22,872 --> 00:12:25,875
You took care of it, right?
I mean...

212
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,747
We broke up a couple months ago.

213
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,101
Okay. That's all
the time we've got.

214
00:13:18,145 --> 00:13:20,974
Hand in the quiz.
We'll pick this up next week.

215
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:31,201
Hey, Dr. Beck. Um...

216
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:37,642
I'm still, um, a little confused
over the whole blood platelets thing.

217
00:13:37,686 --> 00:13:40,907
I was hoping maybe you had some
time to answer a few questions.

218
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,778
Sure. Have a seat.

219
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:43,997
Okay.

220
00:13:46,521 --> 00:13:47,522
Okay.

221
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,960
Could you just... I don't know...

222
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:54,137
Maybe explain it all again?

223
00:13:54,181 --> 00:13:57,097
Sure. the number-one
thing platelets do

224
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:00,143
is they help stop bleeding at the
sight of interrupt endothelium.

225
00:14:00,187 --> 00:14:02,363
And when the platelets
change shape

226
00:14:02,406 --> 00:14:04,408
and turn on the receptors,
we call that what?

227
00:14:04,452 --> 00:14:06,193
Activation. Good girl.

228
00:14:06,236 --> 00:14:09,370
And when they connect... Here's
the big one... to each other,

229
00:14:09,413 --> 00:14:10,632
we call that...

230
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,026
Aggre...

231
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:13,983
Aggregation.

232
00:14:14,027 --> 00:14:16,638
See, it's not so hard.

233
00:14:16,681 --> 00:14:18,031
Thank you.

234
00:14:18,074 --> 00:14:19,902
You're welcome.

235
00:14:21,686 --> 00:14:24,124
Is that you with the president?

236
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,649
Yeah.

237
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,782
That was a long time ago.

238
00:14:53,588 --> 00:14:55,416
I'm really hungry.

239
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:59,637
Wanna get something to eat?

240
00:15:02,684 --> 00:15:04,686
Um...

241
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:05,817
I can't.

242
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:12,433
I, um, have this huge
application I have to fill out

243
00:15:12,476 --> 00:15:15,479
for this financial scholarship,
and it's due tomorrow.

244
00:15:15,523 --> 00:15:17,742
And I really do have to go.

245
00:15:57,652 --> 00:16:00,002
Okay, these handbooks are gonna
prove to be really helpful

246
00:16:00,046 --> 00:16:01,371
over the next
couple of assignments.

247
00:16:01,395 --> 00:16:04,833
If you don't have one,
take one, pass them around.

248
00:16:04,876 --> 00:16:07,836
I know it's a bit old school,
but when you take notes this way,

249
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:11,439
the information has a way of sticking to the
brain cells, which is the whole point, right?

250
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:20,980
Dr. Pervert.

251
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:23,156
Is this some kind of sick joke?

252
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,374
Excuse me?

253
00:16:31,207 --> 00:16:33,035
This is so bad.

254
00:16:36,778 --> 00:16:38,998
Which one of you did this?

255
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,087
Who put those magazines
in my handbooks?

256
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:46,788
I'm paying $45,000 a year
in tuition for this?

257
00:17:53,681 --> 00:17:55,726
Sophie Green.

258
00:18:12,003 --> 00:18:13,570
Hey, Sophie.

259
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:17,966
This yours?

260
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,143
Stay away from me.

261
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:24,146
Thought you were
going to Whittendale.

262
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,974
Transferred. When?

263
00:18:26,017 --> 00:18:28,019
When I heard you were
gonna be teaching here.

264
00:18:28,063 --> 00:18:31,022
So that's why you put
those magazines in my classroom?

265
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:33,175
Trying to get me fired? Don't know
what you're talking about.

266
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:36,985
Security cameras videotaped you
breaking into the room, Sophie.

267
00:18:37,028 --> 00:18:38,378
Yeah? Well, you deserve it.

268
00:18:38,421 --> 00:18:42,164
What do you want from me?
I want you in jail.

269
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,427
This man kidnapped me.
He tried to kill me.

270
00:18:44,471 --> 00:18:45,863
That's not true.

271
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:48,301
Trying to interest more people
in your fake lawsuit?

272
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:49,911
My God. You're bipolar.

273
00:18:49,954 --> 00:18:52,174
- You are delusional.
- I'mdelusional?

274
00:18:52,218 --> 00:18:54,263
We had experts in that
courtroom that proved it.

275
00:18:54,307 --> 00:18:56,961
And in case you forgot,
they found me not guilty.

276
00:18:57,005 --> 00:19:00,182
That jury was rigged.
That trial was a joke.

277
00:19:00,226 --> 00:19:02,532
Whose life are you
gonna try to ruin next time?

278
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:05,013
One of your teachers?
Your dentist?

279
00:19:05,056 --> 00:19:07,668
Gonna make up stories about him
so you can sue and make a fortune?

280
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:09,235
Wow.
You're good.

281
00:19:09,278 --> 00:19:12,063
The only reason you didn't
get rich trying to ruin me

282
00:19:12,107 --> 00:19:14,414
is because
I fought her in court.

283
00:19:14,457 --> 00:19:16,633
Stay away from him, girls.
This man is a pervert.

284
00:19:16,677 --> 00:19:21,072
I saved your life,
and this is how you thank me.

285
00:19:21,116 --> 00:19:24,859
All I've got left
is this teaching job,

286
00:19:24,902 --> 00:19:26,774
and now you wanna take that too.

287
00:19:26,817 --> 00:19:30,212
You bet. I started a
petition to get you fired,

288
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:32,997
and I won't stop until you're
locked in a hole for good.

289
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:37,088
Hey. Why don't you leave him alone, okay?
He doesn't deserve this.

290
00:19:37,132 --> 00:19:38,960
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

291
00:19:39,003 --> 00:19:41,092
What do you know, bitch?
What did you call me?

292
00:19:41,136 --> 00:19:42,976
Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no.
We're not doing this.

293
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:45,445
Stay the hell away from me!

294
00:19:52,887 --> 00:19:56,195
It was that girl who put
the magazines in your class?

295
00:19:59,023 --> 00:20:01,504
I'm sorry you have
to go through this.

296
00:20:11,906 --> 00:20:14,387
So I just wanna make sure
I understand this.

297
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:19,957
You want me and my crew to do a little
attitude adjustment on some guy you know?

298
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:22,960
Yeah. Just rough him up
a little bit.

299
00:20:23,004 --> 00:20:24,571
You know, send him a message.

300
00:20:24,614 --> 00:20:26,442
Who's the guy?

301
00:20:26,486 --> 00:20:27,661
Does it matter?

302
00:20:27,704 --> 00:20:29,445
Yeah, it matters.

303
00:20:29,489 --> 00:20:31,578
Is he a cop? No.

304
00:20:31,621 --> 00:20:33,144
Doctor.

305
00:20:33,188 --> 00:20:35,103
All right.

306
00:20:35,146 --> 00:20:38,672
So, what did
this doctor do to you?

307
00:20:38,715 --> 00:20:41,414
It's a long story,
and you don't need to know.

308
00:20:41,457 --> 00:20:42,893
Can you do it or not?

309
00:20:42,937 --> 00:20:45,635
Look, you want me
to do something for you,

310
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,945
then, you gotta do
a little something for me.

311
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,560
Fine.

312
00:21:08,484 --> 00:21:10,007
Man.

313
00:21:24,108 --> 00:21:25,284
Hey, Dr. Kidnapper!

314
00:21:28,983 --> 00:21:30,027
No, no, no!

315
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:31,246
Okay, wait.

316
00:21:35,598 --> 00:21:37,296
Come on.
Let's go.

317
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,955
God.

318
00:21:48,045 --> 00:21:50,221
Somebody help me.Dr. Beck?

319
00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:53,181
Dr. Beck. My God.

320
00:21:53,224 --> 00:21:55,575
My God. Are you okay?
What happened?

321
00:21:55,618 --> 00:21:59,492
I need... I need... I need
to get to my classroom.

322
00:21:59,535 --> 00:22:01,929
No. You need to go
to the emergency room.No. No.

323
00:22:01,972 --> 00:22:04,148
To my classroom.Okay.
Well, let me help you.

324
00:22:04,192 --> 00:22:05,193
Okay.

325
00:22:05,236 --> 00:22:07,369
Okay. Here we are.

326
00:22:07,413 --> 00:22:09,545
I hurt all over my arm.

327
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:11,373
My arm.
I don't know what's wrong.

328
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:13,070
Take this.Okay.

329
00:22:16,073 --> 00:22:17,553
Man.Here.

330
00:22:17,597 --> 00:22:19,294
Man, man.

331
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,993
Tell me what you need.

332
00:22:23,037 --> 00:22:25,256
Boy. My God.

333
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,911
We're gonna need
to sew up my arm.

334
00:22:27,955 --> 00:22:30,349
Okay. Um...

335
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:32,176
You're gonna do it.

336
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,961
Me?

337
00:22:34,004 --> 00:22:35,266
No.

338
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,094
It's simple.
I'll show you.

339
00:22:37,138 --> 00:22:38,835
Are you crazy?
I can't sew up your arm.

340
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:41,621
You wanna learn something
in medical school, or what?

341
00:22:44,014 --> 00:22:47,191
All right. Okay.
Just tell me what to do.

342
00:22:47,235 --> 00:22:49,106
First start with this.

343
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,761
You know, you did
an excellent job.

344
00:22:51,805 --> 00:22:54,416
Really?
You think so? I do.

345
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,985
I think you're
a natural at this.

346
00:22:58,028 --> 00:23:00,553
Well, I guess it's because
I have a good teacher

347
00:23:00,596 --> 00:23:02,859
who literally bleeds
for his students.

348
00:23:04,557 --> 00:23:08,038
You're probably the last person
on campus who feels that way.

349
00:23:08,082 --> 00:23:12,652
Over half my students dropped out of my
class today and signed that petition.

350
00:23:12,695 --> 00:23:14,044
Yeah. I heard.

351
00:23:14,088 --> 00:23:16,090
How about you?

352
00:23:18,092 --> 00:23:20,486
Are you gonna drop
out of my class?

353
00:23:22,096 --> 00:23:23,793
You wanna know the truth?

354
00:23:25,316 --> 00:23:27,188
I thought about it.

355
00:23:27,231 --> 00:23:29,408
But, um...

356
00:23:30,496 --> 00:23:33,063
I'm gonna stay.
I like your class.

357
00:23:33,107 --> 00:23:35,936
And who cares what Sophie Green and
her friends have to say about you?

358
00:23:35,979 --> 00:23:38,199
I came here to learn
how to be a doctor,

359
00:23:38,242 --> 00:23:40,897
so that's what I'm gonna do.

360
00:23:42,203 --> 00:23:44,553
Are you, sure
you're okay to drive?

361
00:23:44,597 --> 00:23:46,076
I'll be fine.

362
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,036
Well, um, do you have anyone
at home to take care of you?

363
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:51,081
Your wife or...

364
00:23:52,126 --> 00:23:54,041
your girlfriend?

365
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:57,087
Just me.

366
00:23:58,045 --> 00:24:00,917
Well, here, give me your phone.

367
00:24:00,961 --> 00:24:02,528
This is my number,

368
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:07,010
and you can call me
anytime tonight

369
00:24:07,054 --> 00:24:10,449
if you... you need anything.

370
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:12,276
Okay?

371
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,669
Don't even think about it.

372
00:24:13,713 --> 00:24:16,890
It... It doesn't even
matter what time it is.

373
00:24:17,804 --> 00:24:20,633
Just call me. Okay?

374
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,811
Start the car, dude.

375
00:24:24,854 --> 00:24:28,728
We got places to go,
things to do.

376
00:24:28,771 --> 00:24:30,033
In a minute.

377
00:24:31,557 --> 00:24:33,515

00:27:07,451 --> 00:27:09,062
I'll see you in class.

399
00:27:30,953 --> 00:27:33,129
Sophie Green!

400
00:27:35,349 --> 00:27:36,916
It was you, wasn't it?

401
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:38,352
What are you talking about?

402
00:27:38,395 --> 00:27:40,833
You hired those guys to beat up Dr. Beck,
didn't you?

403
00:27:40,876 --> 00:27:43,357
I don't need
to listen to this. Hey, I'm talking to you.

404
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,925
Get your hands off of me!

405
00:27:45,968 --> 00:27:48,318
Admit it!
I know it was you!

406
00:27:48,362 --> 00:27:49,929
You tried to kill him,
didn't you?

407
00:27:49,972 --> 00:27:52,018
You tried to kill him!
I know it was you! Hey, hey.

408
00:27:52,061 --> 00:27:54,324
You're not gonna get away with this!
You hear me?

409
00:27:54,368 --> 00:27:57,110
You're not gonna
get away with this!

410
00:27:57,153 --> 00:27:59,678
Watch me.

411
00:28:03,072 --> 00:28:05,727
Fourteen of your students
came to the office yesterday.

412
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:07,598
They wanna transfer
to a different class.

413
00:28:07,642 --> 00:28:09,426
Well, you can thank
Sophie Green for that.

414
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:12,212
So now you're telling me she had
some of her friends beat you up?

415
00:28:12,255 --> 00:28:13,909
Probably, yeah.

416
00:28:13,953 --> 00:28:16,259
You've gotta get that girl
out of this school, pal.

417
00:28:16,303 --> 00:28:19,785
Not that easy.
There's no proof she was involved.

418
00:28:19,828 --> 00:28:22,526
Come on. She's the one who started
the petition to get me fired.

419
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,224
I can't kick
a student out of school

420
00:28:24,267 --> 00:28:25,921
for protesting
against a teacher, Albert.

421
00:28:25,965 --> 00:28:27,444
You know that.

422
00:28:27,488 --> 00:28:29,751
On the other hand,
I just spent the last six months

423
00:28:29,795 --> 00:28:31,207
begging the board of
directors to hire you.

424
00:28:31,231 --> 00:28:32,928
So I'm not gonna
let you go either.

425
00:28:32,972 --> 00:28:34,408
So what are you gonna do?

426
00:28:34,451 --> 00:28:35,931
Tomorrow, 1:00,

427
00:28:35,975 --> 00:28:38,586
you, me, Sophie,
the board of directors,

428
00:28:38,629 --> 00:28:40,414
we're gonna meet
in the conference room

429
00:28:40,457 --> 00:28:41,981
and come up with an arrangement

430
00:28:42,024 --> 00:28:43,896
so the two of you
can coexist on campus.

431
00:28:43,939 --> 00:28:46,202
I don't think
that's a good idea. It's not.

432
00:28:46,246 --> 00:28:47,769
It's a terrible idea.

433
00:28:47,813 --> 00:28:51,077
But that's what the board wants to
do, so we're gonna do it.

434
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,992
Welcome to academia.

435
00:28:53,035 --> 00:28:54,863
I'll see you tomorrow.

436
00:29:01,609 --> 00:29:03,742
Sophie, may I speak
to you a minute?

437
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,093
Save it for the meeting
tomorrow.

438
00:29:07,136 --> 00:29:09,486
Please, honey, will you just
have a look at this?

439
00:29:12,185 --> 00:29:13,360
I...

440
00:29:13,403 --> 00:29:16,145
I had a lawyer draw it up.

441
00:29:16,189 --> 00:29:19,148
It's an agreement between you and me.
It protects the both of us.

442
00:29:19,192 --> 00:29:21,716
It says we have to stay a hundred
yards away from each other.

443
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,413
And if I'm in breach,

444
00:29:23,457 --> 00:29:25,720
you can sue me
for everything I'm worth.

445
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,069
What if I'm in breach?

446
00:29:27,113 --> 00:29:29,724
Well, you just pay
a fine. Fifty bucks.

447
00:29:32,988 --> 00:29:35,599
Read it.
Show it to your parents.

448
00:29:35,643 --> 00:29:38,298
I don't need to.
You got a pen? Sure.

449
00:29:39,647 --> 00:29:41,736
Here you go.

450
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,174
Shove it up your nose.
I'm not signing anything.

451
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:48,525
Now, get away from me
before I call security.

452
00:30:31,177 --> 00:30:32,178
What happened?

453
00:30:32,221 --> 00:30:34,310
I don't know.
She just doubled over.

454
00:30:36,008 --> 00:30:38,532
Are you taking
any medication? Get away from me.

455
00:30:38,575 --> 00:30:40,012
Okay, call 911.

456
00:30:40,055 --> 00:30:42,710
Are you taking
any drugs or alcohol? No. I'm clean.

457
00:30:42,753 --> 00:30:45,147
I need something to keep her warm.
We have to keep her warm.

458
00:30:45,191 --> 00:30:47,454
Yes. I have a young lady, 20s.
She's on the ground.

459
00:30:47,497 --> 00:30:49,543
She's shaking.
I think she's going into shock.

460
00:30:49,586 --> 00:30:53,895
We're at the lunch pavilion at,
Southeastern Arizona University.

461
00:30:53,939 --> 00:30:55,897
Yes, I'll keep the line open.

462
00:30:55,941 --> 00:30:57,464
Okay, all right.
Please.

463
00:30:57,507 --> 00:30:58,900
Hurry.

464
00:30:58,944 --> 00:31:00,771
My God.

465
00:31:00,815 --> 00:31:02,425
Fentanyl.
She's taking fentanyl.

466
00:31:02,469 --> 00:31:04,142
I can't breathe.Dinoxyline.
We need dinoxyline.

467
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:07,082
We used to have some at the nurse's office.
I have some, I think.

468
00:31:11,217 --> 00:31:12,958
My God. I do.
Here we go.

469
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:16,004
This is dinoxyline.
I'm gonna squirt this up your nose.

470
00:31:16,048 --> 00:31:19,114
It's gonna counteract the drugs that are
in your system. Ready? Snort this. Sniff.

471
00:31:19,138 --> 00:31:20,574
Good girl.

472
00:31:21,662 --> 00:31:22,837
Sniff.

473
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,012
Good girl.

474
00:31:24,056 --> 00:31:26,710
Okay, now, breathe deep.
Breathe deep.

475
00:31:26,754 --> 00:31:28,234
Good girl.

476
00:31:33,021 --> 00:31:35,154
So, what do you think?
She's addicted?

477
00:31:35,197 --> 00:31:36,938
Well, it looks that way.

478
00:31:36,982 --> 00:31:39,071
Yeah, everybody's
getting hooked on painkillers.

479
00:31:39,114 --> 00:31:42,204
I mean, we have a whole country
with an opioid addiction right now.

480
00:31:42,248 --> 00:31:45,816
Well, we got a drug-free
policy on campus.

481
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,969
I'm gonna have to tell the
board of directors about this.

482
00:31:47,993 --> 00:31:49,951
What a shame.

483
00:31:49,995 --> 00:31:52,780
Looks like we can cancel
that meeting tomorrow.Yeah.

484
00:31:52,823 --> 00:31:54,825
Thanks. You're welcome.

485
00:31:56,653 --> 00:32:00,005
The board of directors and I gave
this a great deal of thought.

486
00:32:00,048 --> 00:32:02,268
Personally, I think
you're a bright young woman

487
00:32:02,311 --> 00:32:04,183
with a wonderful future
ahead of you.

488
00:32:04,226 --> 00:32:07,447
But, Sophie, after reviewing
this case for the last week,

489
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:10,450
we've come to the conclusion that we
need to terminate your enrollment.

490
00:32:10,493 --> 00:32:12,669
You think I'm
a drug addict, don't you?

491
00:32:12,713 --> 00:32:13,844
I didn't say that.

492
00:32:13,888 --> 00:32:17,239
Beck put those drugs
in my backpack.

493
00:32:17,283 --> 00:32:18,806
You don't care.

494
00:32:18,849 --> 00:32:21,896
You knew he was a pervert,
but you gave him the job anyway.

495
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,944
That man is
a con artist and a fraud.

496
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:35,127
Do you even have any idea how
many students signed my petition?

497
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,476
Your petition is irrelevant.

498
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:40,132
1,293.

499
00:32:42,047 --> 00:32:43,526
And counting.

500
00:32:51,491 --> 00:32:53,232
Dr. Beck?

501
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:57,236
I got
the scholarship. That's great!

502
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,108
Dean Sanchez told me that you
had something to do with it,

503
00:33:00,152 --> 00:33:02,371
so thank you.

504
00:33:02,415 --> 00:33:04,547
And I heard
about how Sophie overdosed

505
00:33:04,591 --> 00:33:08,334
at the lunch tables the other
day and that you saved her life.

506
00:33:08,377 --> 00:33:11,250
Well, yeah, basically.

507
00:33:11,293 --> 00:33:13,556
That is so generous of you.

508
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,123
I mean, she ruins your career,

509
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:17,169
and... and yet you
still helped her out.

510
00:33:17,212 --> 00:33:18,997
You're gonna be
a doctor someday.

511
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,086
You would've done
the same thing.

512
00:33:21,129 --> 00:33:22,957
You referring
to somebody like that?

513
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,046
I'm not so sure.

514
00:33:26,352 --> 00:33:27,527
You son of a bitch!

515
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:30,138
They kicked me out of school
because of you!

516
00:33:30,182 --> 00:33:33,098
You set me up!
You poisoned me!

517
00:33:33,141 --> 00:33:34,490
Get off of him!

518
00:33:34,534 --> 00:33:36,927
- Don't touch me, you bitch!
- Somebody call security!

519
00:33:36,971 --> 00:33:38,146
Get off of me!

520
00:33:39,104 --> 00:33:40,366
Hey, let her go!

521
00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:43,064
Yeah?
Your little bitch, Beck!

522
00:33:43,108 --> 00:33:45,066
You let her fight
your battles for you?

523
00:33:46,111 --> 00:33:48,504
I'm talking to you!

524
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:54,162
You are done, Beck!
I'm gonna nail you for what you did!

525
00:33:54,206 --> 00:33:57,600
That's it, Sophie. We're getting
a restraining order against you.

526
00:33:57,644 --> 00:34:00,125
You think you can just kick me
out of school and shut me up?

527
00:34:00,168 --> 00:34:01,169
You think I'm going away?

528
00:34:01,213 --> 00:34:03,084
Get her out of here.

529
00:34:03,128 --> 00:34:04,694
I'm gonna let
the whole world know

530
00:34:04,738 --> 00:34:06,237
you hired a sex predator
to teach here.

531
00:34:06,261 --> 00:34:08,002
You're out of a job,
you corporate pimp.

532
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,960
You're done!

533
00:34:10,004 --> 00:34:11,049
You're done!

534
00:34:12,963 --> 00:34:14,530
All right, show's over.

535
00:34:14,574 --> 00:34:16,619
Back to class.

536
00:34:16,663 --> 00:34:18,839
Come on. Back to class.

537
00:34:24,671 --> 00:34:26,412
Can I speak with you privately?

538
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,812
Hey, Mom.

539
00:34:35,856 --> 00:34:39,033
I just got off the phone with the
registrar's office at Whittendale.

540
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,861
You remember Whittendale,

541
00:34:40,904 --> 00:34:44,082
the school that you're
apparently not enrolled in.

542
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:47,824
They said that you transferred to
Southeastern Arizona University.

543
00:34:47,868 --> 00:34:50,653
Yeah, well, I don't go to Southeastern
Arizona University anymore.

544
00:34:50,697 --> 00:34:52,133
They just kicked me out.

545
00:34:52,177 --> 00:34:53,917
Wait. Hold on. What?

546
00:34:53,961 --> 00:34:55,484
Forget it.
It doesn't even matter.

547
00:34:55,528 --> 00:34:57,965
Sophie, that is
where Dr. Beck teaches.

548
00:34:58,008 --> 00:34:59,488
Yeah, kind of.

549
00:34:59,532 --> 00:35:03,013
Look, whatever you're doing,
you need to just stop it.

550
00:35:03,057 --> 00:35:05,712
Mom, just listen to me,
all right? It's working.

551
00:35:05,755 --> 00:35:07,235
What's working?

552
00:35:07,279 --> 00:35:09,150
I think I just got him fired.

553
00:35:09,194 --> 00:35:12,327
Congratulations. And you're gonna
get yourself killed in the process.

554
00:35:12,371 --> 00:35:15,156
You need to leave that place,
and you need to come home now.

555
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,158
Mom, that's not
gonna happen, all right?

556
00:35:17,202 --> 00:35:19,963
I've got a plan that's gonna get rid of
him for good, and I'm following through.

557
00:35:19,987 --> 00:35:21,293
Honey.

558
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,861
Listen.

559
00:35:24,905 --> 00:35:27,255
Ever since you were tiny,

560
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:30,128
you have always been brave,

561
00:35:30,171 --> 00:35:33,479
and you always do the right
thing, and I love that about you.

562
00:35:33,522 --> 00:35:36,264
But this guy has
made you suffer enough,

563
00:35:36,308 --> 00:35:39,006
and you don't have to do this.

564
00:35:39,049 --> 00:35:41,269
I know what you're going through.

565
00:35:41,313 --> 00:35:45,055
No. No, you do not.

566
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:48,102
You don't know what I'm going
through because he didn't kidnap you.

567
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,931
He didn't try to kill you.

568
00:35:50,974 --> 00:35:53,716
I can't sleep at night.

569
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,894
You know when you wake up and for a split
second you don't know where you're at?

570
00:35:57,938 --> 00:36:01,333
Well, every single morning when I
open my eyes, it's just a flash,

571
00:36:01,376 --> 00:36:04,074
but I swear to you
I'm back in that house.

572
00:36:04,945 --> 00:36:07,991
I'm in his bed and tied up,

573
00:36:08,035 --> 00:36:10,907
and he has his hands on me,

574
00:36:10,951 --> 00:36:13,388
and I cannot shake it.

575
00:36:13,432 --> 00:36:15,521
And if I don't do
something about it,

576
00:36:15,564 --> 00:36:18,524
I'm gonna need meds for the rest of
my life, because I'm gonna go nuts.

577
00:36:19,525 --> 00:36:21,222
Soph.

578
00:36:23,006 --> 00:36:25,792
Why the hell do you
have to be so stubborn?

579
00:36:28,925 --> 00:36:30,927
Got it from you.

580
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:35,062
Mom, I need your help.

581
00:36:35,105 --> 00:36:37,978
And just you.
You cannot tell Dad.

582
00:36:38,021 --> 00:36:40,110
Help with what?

583
00:36:40,154 --> 00:36:42,983
Look, I'll explain that
to you later, but just...

584
00:36:43,026 --> 00:36:45,290
please say yes.

585
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:47,074
No. Please.

586
00:36:47,117 --> 00:36:48,510
Mom?

587
00:36:49,816 --> 00:36:52,819
I'm gonna do this
no matter what you say.

588
00:36:53,994 --> 00:36:55,996
Are you with me or not?

589
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,697
What do you need me to do?

590
00:37:08,095 --> 00:37:11,011
I have done nothing wrong
since I got here.

591
00:37:11,054 --> 00:37:13,056
That woman's a liar.

592
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,667
And a drug addict.

593
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,601
Have you seen how many students
signed the petition?

594
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:18,410
No.Over a thousand.

595
00:37:18,453 --> 00:37:21,282
- Man.
- I don't need this kind of publicity, Al.

596
00:37:21,326 --> 00:37:24,503
If our donors find out about this,
they're gonna pull my budget.

597
00:37:28,028 --> 00:37:32,424
Look, when I heard
about your trial...

598
00:37:32,467 --> 00:37:35,688
I really wanted to help you get
your life back together again.

599
00:37:35,731 --> 00:37:37,037
I really did.

600
00:37:38,168 --> 00:37:39,735
This is just too much.

601
00:37:41,128 --> 00:37:43,043
I'm sorry.

602
00:37:43,086 --> 00:37:46,176
Man.

603
00:37:49,092 --> 00:37:51,921
Dr. Beck.
Hey, Dr. Beck.

604
00:37:52,922 --> 00:37:54,010
Hey.

605
00:37:54,054 --> 00:37:56,056
They, rescheduled
my class with you

606
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:57,884
for a different day
and a different teacher.

607
00:37:57,927 --> 00:37:59,146
What happened?

608
00:37:59,189 --> 00:38:02,323
They... They let me go.

609
00:38:02,367 --> 00:38:05,457
It's because of that disgusting
piece of crap Sophie Green, isn't it?

610
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,459
Hey, it doesn't do
any good to blame her.

611
00:38:07,502 --> 00:38:09,199
It just didn't work out,
that's all.

612
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,551
Well, um,
can I ask you something?

613
00:38:12,594 --> 00:38:13,726
Sure.

614
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:15,641
You can just be honest.

615
00:38:15,684 --> 00:38:19,340
Um, is there any truth
in what she's saying about you?

616
00:38:19,384 --> 00:38:20,950
None at all.

617
00:38:20,994 --> 00:38:24,127
She made up this elaborate
fantasy just so she could sue me.

618
00:38:24,171 --> 00:38:26,347
It happens to a lot of doctors.

619
00:38:26,391 --> 00:38:29,350
Kind of feel
like I let you down.

620
00:38:29,394 --> 00:38:33,311
You actually did
the total opposite.

621
00:38:33,354 --> 00:38:35,313
You taught me so much.

622
00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:37,184
I'm really gonna miss you.

623
00:38:46,106 --> 00:38:49,936
Hey, would you
like to get a coffee

624
00:38:49,979 --> 00:38:53,156
or a doughnut
or... something?

625
00:38:54,027 --> 00:38:55,333
Yeah.

626
00:38:55,376 --> 00:38:57,204
Yeah, I'd love that.

627
00:39:01,687 --> 00:39:03,079
More wine?

628
00:39:03,123 --> 00:39:04,123
Please.

629
00:39:12,219 --> 00:39:13,699
Salud.

630
00:39:17,572 --> 00:39:21,054
So, um, how come
you're not married?

631
00:39:21,097 --> 00:39:23,883
I was married once.
For a little while.

632
00:39:23,926 --> 00:39:27,713
But in all honesty,
and I hate to admit it,

633
00:39:27,756 --> 00:39:30,237
I wasn't really
in love with her.

634
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,196
You married somebody,
but you didn't love her?

635
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,721
I felt sorry for her.

636
00:39:35,764 --> 00:39:37,853
And she was raising
a daughter on her own

637
00:39:37,897 --> 00:39:39,246
and she needed financial help.

638
00:39:39,289 --> 00:39:41,553
And at the time...

639
00:39:43,076 --> 00:39:45,557
I thought it was
the right thing to do.

640
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,123
Well, why did you break up?

641
00:39:48,037 --> 00:39:49,735
She fell...

642
00:39:51,606 --> 00:39:53,739
in love with somebody else.

643
00:39:55,871 --> 00:39:57,395
That's awful.

644
00:39:59,048 --> 00:40:01,355
So what about you?

645
00:40:02,574 --> 00:40:04,402
Are you seeing anybody?

646
00:40:04,445 --> 00:40:05,968
No. I...

647
00:40:06,012 --> 00:40:08,014
I haven't been
on a date in a while.

648
00:40:09,276 --> 00:40:12,627
I guess you can say
that I am allergic to guys.

649
00:40:12,671 --> 00:40:14,368
It sounds serious.

650
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,023
Is it contagious?

651
00:40:17,066 --> 00:40:18,328
Not all guys.

652
00:40:18,372 --> 00:40:21,810
Just... Just guys my own age.

653
00:40:22,898 --> 00:40:25,074
And what's wrong
with guys your own age?

654
00:40:25,118 --> 00:40:26,467
They just wanna party.

655
00:40:26,511 --> 00:40:29,427
And they all have
something to prove.

656
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:32,560
"Hey, baby, wanna get drunk
and hook up?" Like...

657
00:40:32,604 --> 00:40:34,214
I don't know.
I'm just sick of it.

658
00:40:34,257 --> 00:40:37,783
I just want an intelligent guy
to have a conversation with.

659
00:40:37,826 --> 00:40:41,961
You know? And no drama. There's always
so much drama dating people your own age.

660
00:40:42,004 --> 00:40:44,311
Ha. Tell me about it.

661
00:40:44,354 --> 00:40:45,965
It's weird. I...

662
00:40:47,749 --> 00:40:51,057
All my friends have always been
a couple of years older than me.

663
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:54,756
Maybe it's because I was
the youngest of four kids.

664
00:40:56,018 --> 00:40:58,978
And everybody
always says that I...

665
00:40:59,021 --> 00:41:01,894
That I have a father complex.

666
00:41:04,113 --> 00:41:06,464
Why do they say that?

667
00:41:07,552 --> 00:41:09,641
Well, um,

668
00:41:09,684 --> 00:41:14,123
my last boyfriend, he was...

669
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:16,386
Well, he was 51.

670
00:41:18,563 --> 00:41:20,478
Really?

671
00:41:21,522 --> 00:41:24,656
I guess I have a thing
for older men.

672
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,832
Is that weird?

673
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:30,096
No, I really don't...
Don't have an opinion.

674
00:41:31,924 --> 00:41:33,665
Can I make a confession?

675
00:41:34,753 --> 00:41:36,145
Sure.

676
00:41:37,756 --> 00:41:40,715
When I heard that you were
gonna be a teacher at my school,

677
00:41:40,759 --> 00:41:44,066
I was really excited because of your
reputation as a cardiologist and all,

678
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,894
but...

679
00:41:45,938 --> 00:41:48,331
I don't know. When I...

680
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:51,900
When I met you
that first day, I kind of,

681
00:41:51,944 --> 00:41:56,470
well, developed
a... a crush on you.

682
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:01,040
You're playing with fire,
my friend.

683
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:03,738
You're about to make
a great, big mistake.

684
00:42:03,782 --> 00:42:06,393
Now, call her a taxi
and send her home, pal.

685
00:42:19,972 --> 00:42:23,192
So, how do you like Phoenix?

686
00:42:23,236 --> 00:42:25,325
Have you found
a nice place to live?

687
00:42:25,368 --> 00:42:26,805
I did.

688
00:42:26,848 --> 00:42:28,589
I did.

689
00:42:28,633 --> 00:42:30,939
But it's too big for one person.

690
00:42:30,983 --> 00:42:33,028
Yeah?

691
00:42:33,072 --> 00:42:34,160
How big?

692
00:42:39,252 --> 00:42:41,907
My God.

693
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:44,083
I know, right?

694
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:47,042
Wanna take a tour?

695
00:42:47,086 --> 00:42:48,870
Yeah. Why not?

696
00:42:48,914 --> 00:42:50,872
There's
the living room.-

697
00:42:50,916 --> 00:42:53,614
Kitchen. Out back
is the swimming pool.

698
00:42:53,658 --> 00:42:55,703
Waterfall.
Miniature golf course.

699
00:42:55,747 --> 00:42:57,183
Are you trying to impress me?

700
00:42:57,226 --> 00:42:58,793
Is it working?

701
00:43:00,055 --> 00:43:01,970
Wanna see my screening room?

702
00:43:02,014 --> 00:43:05,408
And this is the master bedroom.

703
00:43:05,452 --> 00:43:07,933
Through that window
I have the most wonderful view.

704
00:43:14,722 --> 00:43:17,072
You forgot about that photo,
didn't you?

705
00:43:17,116 --> 00:43:19,161
You blew it, man.

706
00:43:19,205 --> 00:43:22,097
You were this close, man, to getting that
wonderful girl to fall in love with you,

707
00:43:22,121 --> 00:43:25,864
but no, you had to be a moron,
and put your sickness

708
00:43:25,907 --> 00:43:28,431
in a picture frame
on your bedside table.

709
00:43:28,475 --> 00:43:32,174
She's gonna turn around and walk
out of here like they all do. Watch.

710
00:43:43,142 --> 00:43:44,622
Now, this is impressive.

711
00:43:51,193 --> 00:43:53,456
- Is it?
- Yes.

712
00:43:54,849 --> 00:43:56,895
Shows how much
you care about me.

713
00:43:56,938 --> 00:43:59,419
Does it?

714
00:43:59,462 --> 00:44:01,813
How much you love me.

715
00:44:10,604 --> 00:44:12,475
My goodness.

716
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:14,652
Is this for real?

717
00:44:14,695 --> 00:44:15,695
Yes.

718
00:44:16,915 --> 00:44:18,264
Definitely yes.

719
00:45:36,603 --> 00:45:37,996
What are you doing in my house?

720
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:39,998
- Call the police.
- No.

721
00:45:40,041 --> 00:45:42,783
Please. Don't.

722
00:45:42,827 --> 00:45:46,656
I was wrong...
about everything.

723
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:49,442
I can see now how happy you
can make a woman, and I...

724
00:45:51,444 --> 00:45:53,663
could've had that,
but I just pushed you away.

725
00:46:05,545 --> 00:46:06,589
Join us.

726
00:46:29,308 --> 00:46:31,701
I borrowed your toothbrush.
Hope you don't mind.

727
00:46:31,745 --> 00:46:32,877
No problem.

728
00:46:36,141 --> 00:46:41,233
All right.
I have got to get to class.

729
00:46:41,276 --> 00:46:44,062
But last night was incredible.

730
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:46,803
You okay?

731
00:46:48,109 --> 00:46:52,897
I just had a dream
that Sophie was here.

732
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,115
With us.

733
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:56,117
Yeah, well,
that will never happen.

734
00:46:56,161 --> 00:46:59,599
Because if she comes anywhere near
you, she'll have to deal with me.

735
00:46:59,642 --> 00:47:02,210
And I'll kick her ass
all the way to New Mexico.

736
00:47:05,431 --> 00:47:07,085
What do you got
going on this afternoon?

737
00:47:07,128 --> 00:47:10,566
Well, now that I'm
unemployed, not much.

738
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:14,614
Well, my last class is at 2:00. So,
do you want to go for a hike or something?

739
00:47:14,657 --> 00:47:16,355
Sounds great.

740
00:47:16,398 --> 00:47:18,444
All right.
Then I'll see you later.

741
00:47:24,015 --> 00:47:25,930
She loves me.

742
00:47:25,973 --> 00:47:27,845
She loves you.

743
00:47:27,888 --> 00:47:30,064
Damn right, she does.

744
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:45,123
Forgot the olive oil.

745
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:12,890
What's going on?

746
00:48:20,201 --> 00:48:21,986
How you feeling
this morning, Albert?

747
00:48:25,293 --> 00:48:26,555
What's that?

748
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:29,167
- You need to help me!
- You got a little pain?

749
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:31,865
Please don't hurt me.

750
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,127
Please don't hurt me.

751
00:48:33,171 --> 00:48:35,913
Maybe a little
physical therapy might help.

752
00:48:39,046 --> 00:48:43,007
Aw. It's kind of tender?
Better take a look.

753
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:44,269
See where the problem is.

754
00:48:44,312 --> 00:48:46,967
Don't hurt me.
My God.

755
00:48:49,013 --> 00:48:53,234
My God!
It's so big!

756
00:48:53,278 --> 00:48:56,107
I'm gonna need a whole team
of nurses just to lift it up.

757
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:57,935
God.

758
00:49:01,155 --> 00:49:03,636
That's what guys
like to hear, right? No.

759
00:49:06,378 --> 00:49:07,901
Lab results are in.

760
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:10,382
According to women
all over the world,

761
00:49:10,425 --> 00:49:14,473
you and your little friend have
been causing all sorts of problems.

762
00:49:14,516 --> 00:49:16,823
So, you know what
I think I'm gonna do?

763
00:49:23,351 --> 00:49:25,092
We're gonna remove it.

764
00:49:29,096 --> 00:49:30,315
What's that?

765
00:49:30,358 --> 00:49:32,708
No. No, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

766
00:49:32,752 --> 00:49:35,015
We don't have any anesthetic.

767
00:49:35,059 --> 00:49:40,673
I'm gonna go nice and slow
so you feel everything.

768
00:49:40,716 --> 00:49:42,414
No! No!

769
00:49:43,371 --> 00:49:45,939
- One.
- No.

770
00:49:48,072 --> 00:49:51,249
Two.

771
00:49:51,292 --> 00:49:52,467
Three.

772
00:49:54,948 --> 00:49:56,863
I just forgot my homework.

773
00:50:02,738 --> 00:50:03,870
Albert?

774
00:50:08,962 --> 00:50:10,137
Are you okay?

775
00:50:13,227 --> 00:50:14,663
Hello?

776
00:50:18,754 --> 00:50:19,929
What the hell?

777
00:50:21,235 --> 00:50:22,454
Albert!

778
00:50:23,585 --> 00:50:25,631
- Who did this to you?
- Help me.

779
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:36,859
Stop!

780
00:50:36,903 --> 00:50:38,968
You're a fool to be with him.
I'll be the judge of that.

781
00:50:38,992 --> 00:50:41,995
He's gonna kill you,
just like he tried to kill me.

782
00:51:02,581 --> 00:51:04,322
Hey.

783
00:51:04,365 --> 00:51:05,801
- Hey.
- God!

784
00:51:05,845 --> 00:51:07,542
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

785
00:51:07,586 --> 00:51:10,067
Untie me.
My God.

786
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,549
- Hey, Mom. I'm on the way home.
- Good. Finally.

787
00:51:14,593 --> 00:51:16,377
I did what we talked about, all right?

788
00:51:16,421 --> 00:51:18,814
If the cops call the house,
you know what to say?

789
00:51:18,858 --> 00:51:20,990
You've been here
the entire time with me.

790
00:51:21,034 --> 00:51:22,731
Yeah. Thanks, Mom.

791
00:51:22,775 --> 00:51:26,300
Drive safe, but get back soon. I love you.

792
00:51:26,344 --> 00:51:27,432
Okay, I love you too.

793
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:35,614
Her name is Sophie Green.
She's a former patient of mine.

794
00:51:35,657 --> 00:51:39,139
The same Sophie Green who accused you
of kidnapping and attempted murder.

795
00:51:39,183 --> 00:51:41,402
I see you did your homework
on me, didn't you?

796
00:51:41,446 --> 00:51:42,621
Sure did.

797
00:51:42,664 --> 00:51:45,145
Sophie refuses to accept
the jury's decision.

798
00:51:45,189 --> 00:51:46,755
She's crazy.

799
00:51:46,799 --> 00:51:49,280
Yeah, well, if I were her,
I'd be a little crazy too.

800
00:51:49,323 --> 00:51:51,891
Yeah, what's that supposed
to mean, Officer?

801
00:51:51,934 --> 00:51:54,372
A lot of people in law
enforcement were surprised

802
00:51:54,415 --> 00:51:56,200
when we heard
you got off so easy.

803
00:51:56,243 --> 00:51:58,419
You mean you were surprised

804
00:51:58,463 --> 00:52:00,160
when the jury
found me not guilty?

805
00:52:00,204 --> 00:52:03,207
Sure. I'll say it
however you like.

806
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:06,011
Yeah, well, maybe you shouldn't be
working on this case if you feel that way.

807
00:52:06,035 --> 00:52:09,169
Miss Peterson,
you're one of his students?

808
00:52:09,213 --> 00:52:10,257
I was.

809
00:52:10,301 --> 00:52:12,041
Until the university fired him

810
00:52:12,085 --> 00:52:14,174
because of all the lies
Sophie told about him.

811
00:52:14,218 --> 00:52:16,916
And the two of you are now,
what, sleeping together?

812
00:52:16,959 --> 00:52:18,874
That's none of your business.

813
00:52:18,918 --> 00:52:21,964
Come on. What are you doing at your
teacher's house at 7:00 in the morning?

814
00:52:22,008 --> 00:52:24,619
Is that your makeup bag
in the upstairs bathroom?

815
00:52:24,663 --> 00:52:26,969
Yes. Okay?

816
00:52:27,013 --> 00:52:28,797
We're sleeping together.

817
00:52:28,841 --> 00:52:31,365
And I'm in love with him,
all right?

818
00:52:31,409 --> 00:52:34,847
So what? That doesn't change the fact
that Sophie Green just tried to kill us.

819
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:36,240
Melissa.

820
00:52:36,283 --> 00:52:38,131
No, they're talking to us
like we're the criminals.

821
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,026
Are you gonna
arrest Sophie Green, or what?

822
00:52:40,069 --> 00:52:42,202
Don't worry.
We'll deal with Miss Green.

823
00:52:45,423 --> 00:52:47,381
We have several witnesses, Dr. Beck,

824
00:52:47,425 --> 00:52:49,253
who can corroborate her alibi.

825
00:52:49,296 --> 00:52:51,385
You're kidding me!
And you believed 'em?

826
00:52:51,429 --> 00:52:53,822
I don't care what they say.
That woman was in this house.

827
00:52:53,866 --> 00:52:56,608
- And she tried... -Right now,
it's your word against theirs.

828
00:52:56,651 --> 00:52:58,131
Thanks a lot, Detective.

829
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,046
You guys are the best.

830
00:53:00,089 --> 00:53:02,875
What's going on?

831
00:53:02,918 --> 00:53:06,879
According to Sophie's roommates, she went home
to California right after she was expelled.

832
00:53:06,922 --> 00:53:08,359
What? Yeah.

833
00:53:08,402 --> 00:53:09,969
And Sophie's parents,
who are in LA,

834
00:53:10,012 --> 00:53:11,642
are saying she was with them
this morning.

835
00:53:11,666 --> 00:53:14,713
I mean, of course Sophie's
parents are gonna lie for her.

836
00:53:14,756 --> 00:53:16,149
It gets worse.

837
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,543
Police found a credit card
purchase and security video

838
00:53:18,586 --> 00:53:21,894
that proves Sophie was at a coffee
shop near her house in Los Angeles

839
00:53:21,937 --> 00:53:26,681
at exactly the same time we said she
was at this house trying to kill me.

840
00:53:26,725 --> 00:53:31,120
Okay, so her mom
dressed up like her,

841
00:53:31,164 --> 00:53:33,906
used her credit card
and bought a coffee.

842
00:53:33,949 --> 00:53:36,169
Are these cops completely
clueless, or what?

843
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:37,910
Regardless,
she put together an alibi.

844
00:53:37,953 --> 00:53:39,912
She thought of everything.

845
00:53:39,955 --> 00:53:43,350
So, do these cops just think
we made this up?

846
00:53:43,394 --> 00:53:44,482
I don't know. Maybe.

847
00:53:46,745 --> 00:53:48,573
It's probably them again.

848
00:53:50,923 --> 00:53:51,880
This is Dr. Beck.

849
00:53:51,924 --> 00:53:54,535
Hi, Dr. Beck. It's me.

850
00:53:54,579 --> 00:53:56,972
Sophie?

851
00:53:57,016 --> 00:53:59,627
I just called because I
wanted you to hear something.

852
00:54:01,063 --> 00:54:04,763
That's a Remington 870
pump shotgun.

853
00:54:04,806 --> 00:54:07,809
I sleep with it underneath
my bed every single night.

854
00:54:07,853 --> 00:54:11,117
And believe me,
I know how to use it.

855
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:14,990
Okay, hold on a second.
What is it you really want?

856
00:54:15,034 --> 00:54:18,429
- Because if it's money...
- I don't want your money.

857
00:54:18,472 --> 00:54:22,302
What I want is to shove this
thing underneath your chin

858
00:54:22,346 --> 00:54:23,782
and pull the trigger.

859
00:54:23,825 --> 00:54:25,392
Is your little girlfriend there?

860
00:54:27,612 --> 00:54:29,570
Yeah, I'm here.

861
00:54:29,614 --> 00:54:32,530
Listen, sister.
I don't wanna hurt you.

862
00:54:32,573 --> 00:54:36,055
But if you try and stop me
like you did this morning,

863
00:54:36,098 --> 00:54:38,318
I'm gonna have to kill you too.

864
00:54:38,362 --> 00:54:40,364
You can't get away with this.

865
00:54:40,407 --> 00:54:42,017
The cops know
what you're trying to do.

866
00:54:42,061 --> 00:54:44,977
The cops? Really?

867
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:48,589
I gave the cops and the lawyers
a mountain of evidence

868
00:54:48,633 --> 00:54:50,983
to put your
little boyfriend in jail

869
00:54:51,026 --> 00:54:54,943
for the rest of his sick life.

870
00:54:54,987 --> 00:54:58,817
For some unexplained reason, the blind
lady of justice just let him walk.

871
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:02,864
You'll forgive me if I've lost
faith in the legal system.

872
00:55:02,908 --> 00:55:04,518
If I die trying to kill him,

873
00:55:04,562 --> 00:55:08,305
well, at least I leave this
planet doing what I know is right.

874
00:55:08,348 --> 00:55:11,308
Dr. Albert Beck
is a monster.

875
00:55:11,351 --> 00:55:13,135
His victims are women.

876
00:55:13,179 --> 00:55:14,659
If you had half a brain
in your head,

877
00:55:14,702 --> 00:55:17,052
you would run away from him
as fast as you could.

878
00:55:17,096 --> 00:55:19,664
Yeah, well,
that's not gonna happen.

879
00:55:19,707 --> 00:55:21,274
Okay? You wanna hurt Albert?

880
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,102
You're gonna have
to go through me.

881
00:55:23,145 --> 00:55:28,107
If you stand by that creep,
then you're gonna die right along with him.

882
00:55:29,021 --> 00:55:30,631
Good night, you two.

883
00:55:30,675 --> 00:55:32,633
Sleep well.

884
00:55:39,074 --> 00:55:40,685
Albert, what are we gonna do?

885
00:55:40,728 --> 00:55:43,601
I'll tell you what we're not gonna do.
We're not gonna panic.

886
00:55:43,644 --> 00:55:46,081
You heard her.
She's insane.

887
00:55:46,125 --> 00:55:48,867
I mean, she's gonna...
She's saying that she's gonna...

888
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:50,434
Shh. It's okay. Calm down.

889
00:55:50,477 --> 00:55:52,871
It's okay, babe. No, it's not okay.

890
00:55:52,914 --> 00:55:57,092
I'm in love with you, and I wanna
spend the rest of my life with you.

891
00:55:57,136 --> 00:55:58,983
But how can I do that
if there's this crazy woman

892
00:55:59,007 --> 00:56:01,793
that says she's gonna come back
here and she's gonna kill us?

893
00:56:01,836 --> 00:56:02,924
Okay, look.

894
00:56:05,405 --> 00:56:07,451
We'll contact the local police.

895
00:56:07,494 --> 00:56:08,974
And if they won't help us,

896
00:56:09,017 --> 00:56:11,150
we'll contact
the state police or the FBI.

897
00:56:11,193 --> 00:56:13,195
My God, you're joking, right?
You're joking.

898
00:56:13,239 --> 00:56:15,197
No, I'm deadly serious.

899
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:18,940
Did you hear how the cops were talking
to you this morning? They're on her side.

900
00:56:18,984 --> 00:56:22,683
They're claiming that she wasn't even here
this morning when I was here as a witness.

901
00:56:22,727 --> 00:56:25,164
Look, don't you get it?
The cops hate you.

902
00:56:25,207 --> 00:56:29,690
They think that you tried
to kidnap her and kill her.

903
00:56:29,734 --> 00:56:31,431
And just like Sophie,
they can't accept

904
00:56:31,475 --> 00:56:33,955
what the court has
already proven to be true.

905
00:56:33,999 --> 00:56:35,609
You're innocent.

906
00:56:35,653 --> 00:56:38,612
Albert, listen to me.
The cops are hoping that she kills you.

907
00:56:40,092 --> 00:56:42,877
They're gonna let her do it,
and they're not gonna stop her.

908
00:56:53,627 --> 00:56:55,368
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

909
00:56:58,327 --> 00:57:00,025
I don't know.
What are you thinking?

910
00:57:02,288 --> 00:57:03,811
We have to kill her.

911
00:57:03,855 --> 00:57:05,596
Don't talk like that.

912
00:57:05,639 --> 00:57:08,076
I don't wanna talk like that,
but you know as well as I do

913
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:10,383
that the cops are not
gonna protect us from her.

914
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:13,212
I'm a doctor.
I'm not gonna kill somebody.

915
00:57:13,255 --> 00:57:15,083
I took an oath to heal,
not to harm.

916
00:57:15,127 --> 00:57:16,824
If we don't do something,

917
00:57:16,868 --> 00:57:19,588
sooner of later, she's gonna come
up here and shotgun the both of us.

918
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,401
How would we do it?

919
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,795
Maybe we'll buy a gun.

920
00:57:33,188 --> 00:57:34,712
We could get it
off the black market.

921
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:40,108
Something that, can't be traced.

922
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,764
And you know, if we pack enough
food, water, and gas,

923
00:57:43,808 --> 00:57:46,680
we could drive to California
and back without stopping.

924
00:57:49,553 --> 00:57:53,034
And there'll be no record
of us even leaving Arizona.

925
00:57:53,078 --> 00:57:55,472
Then we go to her house.

926
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,039
We wait outside.

927
00:58:00,912 --> 00:58:03,741
And then, when the time is right...

928
00:58:05,743 --> 00:58:07,353
we can shoot her.

929
00:58:07,396 --> 00:58:11,226
And when it's all over,
you can be my alibi, and I'll be yours.

930
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:14,534
Then we can tell the cops that
we never even left Arizona.

931
00:58:15,970 --> 00:58:18,016
Tell me we're gonna do this.

932
00:58:19,757 --> 00:58:21,628
No, no, no.

933
00:58:26,328 --> 00:58:27,939
We are gonna do this.

934
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:34,772
You be careful.Yeah.

935
00:58:35,947 --> 00:58:38,036
I love you.

936
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:39,254
I love you too.

937
00:58:42,257 --> 00:58:45,086
You know what to tell Dad?

938
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:46,261
Yeah.

939
00:58:47,567 --> 00:58:49,917
- I'll see you soon.
- No.

940
00:58:52,093 --> 00:58:54,139
Baby, no, you won't.

941
00:59:58,986 --> 01:00:00,684
Why is she stopping?

942
01:00:02,816 --> 01:00:03,861
Look.

943
01:00:07,038 --> 01:00:09,170
She's probably here
to buy her shotgun shells.

944
01:00:09,214 --> 01:00:10,998
I guess she wasn't kidding.

945
01:00:20,007 --> 01:00:21,182
We can't do this.

946
01:00:21,226 --> 01:00:22,967
What?

947
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:24,446
This is insane.

948
01:00:24,490 --> 01:00:26,448
No... I don't know
what I was thinking.

949
01:00:26,492 --> 01:00:29,427
Hell, you're the one who talked me into
this. Now, don't tell me you can't.

950
01:00:29,451 --> 01:00:32,150
I know. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Albert.

951
01:00:32,193 --> 01:00:34,848
I thought I could do this.
I just... I can't do this.

952
01:00:34,892 --> 01:00:37,808
It's gonna be okay. It's okay.

953
01:00:37,851 --> 01:00:40,985
You stay here.
Close your eyes.

954
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:44,031
And when you hear the gunshot...

955
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:47,644
you start the car, all right?

956
01:00:50,342 --> 01:00:51,952
All right?

957
01:00:51,996 --> 01:00:52,997
You're gonna do this?

958
01:00:55,913 --> 01:00:59,699
Wait. Let's just...
Let's just think about this.

959
01:01:00,613 --> 01:01:01,832
I love you.

960
01:01:02,963 --> 01:01:04,356
I love you so much.

961
01:01:08,839 --> 01:01:10,449
What the hell?

962
01:01:22,069 --> 01:01:23,897
Melissa,
what are you doing? Forgive me.

963
01:01:32,906 --> 01:01:34,342
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

964
01:01:34,386 --> 01:01:35,822
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

965
01:01:37,345 --> 01:01:40,479
I guess I shot the gas tank.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

966
01:01:40,522 --> 01:01:42,394
Go! Go! Go! Let's go!

967
01:01:42,437 --> 01:01:44,875
Let's go! Go! Go! Go!

968
01:01:44,918 --> 01:01:46,311
Go! Go! Go!

969
01:01:47,442 --> 01:01:49,662
What the hell
is the matter with you?

970
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:51,272
I'm sorry. I'm panicked.

971
01:01:51,316 --> 01:01:52,772
One minute,
you're telling me can't do it.

972
01:01:52,796 --> 01:01:54,251
Next minute, you're
blowing her frickin'...

973
01:01:54,275 --> 01:01:56,277
I don't know what got into me, okay?
I freaked!

974
01:01:56,321 --> 01:01:59,672
- Yeah, you freaked, all right! - I'm sorry.
I was just trying to save your life.

975
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,805
Man.

976
01:02:10,901 --> 01:02:12,032
Okay.

977
01:02:14,774 --> 01:02:17,995
Los Angeles County coroner's
office has just identified the body

978
01:02:18,038 --> 01:02:22,956
of a woman found shot to death inside
a burning vehicle late last Tuesday.

979
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,046
According to police,
20-year-old Sophie Green

980
01:02:26,090 --> 01:02:28,657
was sitting in her car
parked in a Van Nuys alley

981
01:02:28,701 --> 01:02:30,964
when an unidentified
shooter approached her

982
01:02:31,008 --> 01:02:32,226
and opened fire.

983
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:33,900
Once LA County firefighters
arrived on scene,

984
01:02:33,924 --> 01:02:37,362
they discovered Miss Green's car
completely engulfed in flames.

985
01:02:37,405 --> 01:02:39,843
It was only once that
blaze was extinguished

986
01:02:39,886 --> 01:02:43,020
that firefighters discovered
there was a body inside the car.

987
01:02:43,063 --> 01:02:45,544
According to a pathology report,

988
01:02:45,587 --> 01:02:48,416
coroners had to use dental records
to identify Miss Green's body

989
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:50,636
because it was so badly burned.

990
01:02:50,679 --> 01:02:53,160
Police have yet to determine
the cause for the blaze.

991
01:02:53,204 --> 01:02:54,224
However, investigators tell us...

992
01:02:54,248 --> 01:02:56,076
Okay, okay.

993
01:02:57,208 --> 01:02:59,079
It's over. Okay?

994
01:03:00,037 --> 01:03:01,037
It's over.Yeah.

995
01:03:11,178 --> 01:03:12,571
This is Dr. Beck.

996
01:03:12,614 --> 01:03:16,096
Dr. Beck. Detective Young
with Phoenix Metro.

997
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:17,402
How are you today?

998
01:03:17,445 --> 01:03:19,186
I'm fine, Detective.

999
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:20,405
What can I do for you?

1000
01:03:20,448 --> 01:03:21,841
Well, I'm sure
you heard the news.

1001
01:03:21,885 --> 01:03:25,845
Sophie Green was found
murdered Tuesday night in LA.

1002
01:03:25,889 --> 01:03:27,847
No, I hadn't heard.

1003
01:03:27,891 --> 01:03:30,197
We'd like to ask you a few
questions, if that's all right.

1004
01:03:30,241 --> 01:03:32,721
What do you say we drop by
in, what, an hour?

1005
01:03:33,897 --> 01:03:35,097
Sure, come on by.
I'll be here.

1006
01:03:46,474 --> 01:03:48,172
Dr. Beck!

1007
01:03:48,215 --> 01:03:50,957
Detectives Young and Sandler.

1008
01:03:51,001 --> 01:03:52,002
Hey, they're here.

1009
01:03:54,482 --> 01:03:56,658
Albert, the cops
are at the front door.

1010
01:03:56,702 --> 01:03:58,095
All right.
I'll be out in a minute.

1011
01:04:07,756 --> 01:04:09,280
Are you ready?

1012
01:04:09,323 --> 01:04:12,892
No, I'm scared. They didn't
ask to talk to me, did they?

1013
01:04:12,936 --> 01:04:14,894
No. But I really
want you there.

1014
01:04:14,938 --> 01:04:17,438
Yeah, but that doesn't look good
for you if I'm always with you.

1015
01:04:17,462 --> 01:04:20,073
Baby.

1016
01:04:20,117 --> 01:04:21,877
Okay, look, I'm gonna
stay up here and listen.

1017
01:04:21,901 --> 01:04:23,468
If you need anything,
just call me,

1018
01:04:23,511 --> 01:04:24,686
and I'll come down, okay?

1019
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:26,950
Dr. Beck, are you home?

1020
01:04:26,993 --> 01:04:29,909
Please, my love.
I'm not ready to talk to them.

1021
01:04:29,953 --> 01:04:32,129
Please. Please.Okay.

1022
01:04:34,609 --> 01:04:35,610
Okay.

1023
01:04:40,528 --> 01:04:42,487
How was she killed exactly?

1024
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:45,446
She was shot several times
and her car was set on fire.

1025
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:47,405
My God. That's horrible.

1026
01:04:47,448 --> 01:04:50,277
If I remember correctly,
at your trial,

1027
01:04:50,321 --> 01:04:54,499
didn't Sophie Green say that you tried to
fake her death by setting her car on fire?

1028
01:04:54,542 --> 01:04:58,242
You know, she said a lot of things that...
just weren't true.

1029
01:04:58,285 --> 01:05:00,200
Yes, but what a coincidence.

1030
01:05:00,244 --> 01:05:03,638
I mean, first you're accused of faking
her death by lighting her car on fire.

1031
01:05:03,682 --> 01:05:06,119
And then, just last Tuesday
night, Sophie is murdered.

1032
01:05:06,163 --> 01:05:07,555
For real this time.

1033
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:09,209
And her car goes up in flames.

1034
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:11,516
What are the odds?

1035
01:05:11,559 --> 01:05:12,604
Who knows?

1036
01:05:12,647 --> 01:05:16,390
Geez, maybe one in a billion.

1037
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:28,141
Where were you last Tuesday?

1038
01:05:28,185 --> 01:05:30,839
- Here. At home.
- Can anybody verify that?

1039
01:05:30,883 --> 01:05:32,972
Melissa.
She was with me.

1040
01:05:33,016 --> 01:05:35,366
Who's Melissa again?
Right. She's the...

1041
01:05:35,409 --> 01:05:39,544
Twenty-year-old college student
he's now sleeping with.

1042
01:05:39,587 --> 01:05:41,981
You do have a thing for the young
ones, don't you, Doc?

1043
01:05:42,025 --> 01:05:45,071
Help! Help me! I'm upstairs!

1044
01:05:46,638 --> 01:05:47,813
Help!

1045
01:05:50,033 --> 01:05:52,165
Help me! I'm upstairs!

1046
01:05:57,605 --> 01:06:01,435
Help! Get me out!

1047
01:06:01,479 --> 01:06:02,784
Holy crap.

1048
01:06:05,048 --> 01:06:06,049
Please help me.

1049
01:06:09,661 --> 01:06:12,011
- My God.
- He's insane!

1050
01:06:12,055 --> 01:06:15,841
- He tried to kill me.
- Melissa, why did you do this?

1051
01:06:15,884 --> 01:06:17,190
Wait. Did I do this?

1052
01:06:19,888 --> 01:06:22,717
Dr. Albert Beck,
you're under arrest.

1053
01:06:25,503 --> 01:06:27,026
- You okay?
- I don't know.

1054
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:28,854
Go after him.
I'll call for backup.

1055
01:06:28,897 --> 01:06:30,029
This is Detective Young.

1056
01:07:22,734 --> 01:07:24,562
Why did she do that to me?

1057
01:07:25,737 --> 01:07:27,391
Why? Why? Why?

1058
01:07:28,435 --> 01:07:29,436
Told you so.

1059
01:07:49,978 --> 01:07:52,459
I started asking him if any
of the allegations were true.

1060
01:07:53,939 --> 01:07:56,376
Like if he actually
did kidnap Sophie.

1061
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:59,988
And... I don't know... he completely
changed and became a different person.

1062
01:08:00,032 --> 01:08:01,990
And started screaming at me
and yelling at me...

1063
01:08:02,034 --> 01:08:03,601
It's okay.

1064
01:08:03,644 --> 01:08:05,211
Take your time.

1065
01:08:06,212 --> 01:08:07,692
And then he...

1066
01:08:08,954 --> 01:08:13,176
He tied me up and he...
He raped me, practically.

1067
01:08:13,219 --> 01:08:15,787
I mean, I know we were
in a relationship,

1068
01:08:15,830 --> 01:08:17,702
and I said I loved him,

1069
01:08:17,745 --> 01:08:21,619
but when I told him I didn't wanna
have sex, he just... he wouldn't listen.

1070
01:08:21,662 --> 01:08:24,187
No means no.Exactly.

1071
01:08:24,230 --> 01:08:29,061
And then he just kept rambling on and
on about how he was gonna kill Sophie.

1072
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:32,891
And if I didn't obey him, he was
gonna cut my boobs off or something.

1073
01:08:32,934 --> 01:08:34,110
Unbelievable.

1074
01:08:35,676 --> 01:08:38,897
We found these under the bed.
Do they look familiar?

1075
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:43,423
Yeah, I think he was tinkering with
that for a science project or something.

1076
01:08:43,467 --> 01:08:46,383
I don't know.
He didn't tell me what it was though.

1077
01:08:46,426 --> 01:08:48,211
What is it? C-4.

1078
01:08:48,254 --> 01:08:51,083
Construction dynamite
with a remote detonator.

1079
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:53,085
Everything you need
to make a bomb.

1080
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:56,044
That explains Sophie's car
going up in flames.

1081
01:08:56,088 --> 01:08:59,047
Did he say where he might go
after he killed Sophie?

1082
01:08:59,091 --> 01:09:01,093
For instance,
to Mexico again or...

1083
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:05,315
No. No.
Nothing like that.

1084
01:09:06,968 --> 01:09:08,535
When you think
you know somebody...

1085
01:09:09,928 --> 01:09:12,278
When you think
you know what love is...

1086
01:09:12,322 --> 01:09:14,889
God, I'm such an idiot.

1087
01:09:15,934 --> 01:09:18,154
Don't worry.
We'll find the bastard.

1088
01:09:33,081 --> 01:09:36,302
A prominent figure in the
world of cardiothoracic surgery

1089
01:09:36,346 --> 01:09:37,912
is the target of a statewide manhunt.

1090
01:09:39,218 --> 01:09:41,699
Dr. Albert Beck is wanted for the murder

1091
01:09:41,742 --> 01:09:43,701
of a 20-year-old female medical student

1092
01:09:43,744 --> 01:09:47,661
whose body was found in her burning
car last week in Los Angeles.

1093
01:09:47,705 --> 01:09:50,490
Dr. Beck was last seen
at his mansion in Phoenix

1094
01:09:50,534 --> 01:09:52,449
where local police discovered

1095
01:09:52,492 --> 01:09:56,104
he had been holding another female
medical student hostage for several weeks.

1096
01:09:56,148 --> 01:09:58,019
He is considered armed and dangerous.

1097
01:09:58,063 --> 01:09:59,673
This is the second time

1098
01:09:59,717 --> 01:10:02,077
Dr. Beck has been accused of
attempting to kill Miss Green.

1099
01:10:03,503 --> 01:10:06,941
What if somebody came
in the house and tied her up...

1100
01:10:07,942 --> 01:10:09,944
when I went downstairs?

1101
01:10:11,294 --> 01:10:14,427
You don't really believe that,
do you, man?

1102
01:10:14,471 --> 01:10:16,037
I mean, they say love
makes you stupid,

1103
01:10:16,081 --> 01:10:19,127
but in your case, it's terminal.

1104
01:10:19,171 --> 01:10:21,391
She loved me, man.
I know she did.

1105
01:10:21,434 --> 01:10:23,044
Even you said she did.

1106
01:10:23,088 --> 01:10:25,133
She had me fooled too, pal.

1107
01:10:25,177 --> 01:10:28,876
I wanna call her.
I wanna see her again.

1108
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:31,139
No! You wanna stay
away from her

1109
01:10:31,183 --> 01:10:33,490
and get out of this country
as fast as you can...

1110
01:10:33,533 --> 01:10:36,449
That's really easy for you to
say, but you don't realize, man.

1111
01:10:36,493 --> 01:10:40,540
Nobody... Nobody has ever
loved me the way she did.

1112
01:10:40,584 --> 01:10:42,499
Well, that's because
she was pretending.

1113
01:10:42,542 --> 01:10:43,935
She framed you, pal.

1114
01:10:43,978 --> 01:10:45,937
You say she's
not like all the rest.

1115
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:46,851
You're right.

1116
01:10:46,894 --> 01:10:48,156
She's worse.

1117
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:51,943
But I was...
I was so happy with her.

1118
01:10:58,123 --> 01:11:00,386
- What really happened between you guys?
- I don't know.

1119
01:11:00,430 --> 01:11:03,084
It's kind of a long story.
But I'm gonna go run some errands, okay?

1120
01:11:03,128 --> 01:11:04,956
I'll tell you
later.Okay.

1121
01:11:04,999 --> 01:11:06,412
- I'll call you later.
- It was good seeing you.

1122
01:11:06,436 --> 01:11:07,436
Bye.

1123
01:12:29,867 --> 01:12:30,911
Hey.

1124
01:12:32,870 --> 01:12:35,220
It's me. How'd it go?

1125
01:12:35,263 --> 01:12:36,874
Good, I think.

1126
01:12:36,917 --> 01:12:40,834
I got everything that we need.
And you are gonna look awesome.

1127
01:12:40,878 --> 01:12:43,010
Thank you
for letting me stay here.

1128
01:12:43,054 --> 01:12:45,361
Yeah, of course. Anytime.
It's my aunt and uncle's place.

1129
01:12:45,404 --> 01:12:47,058
And they're always on the road,

1130
01:12:47,101 --> 01:12:48,625
so it's not a big deal at all.

1131
01:12:48,668 --> 01:12:50,453
Be right back.Yeah.

1132
01:13:03,988 --> 01:13:05,685
I think we're good.
Let me see.

1133
01:13:05,729 --> 01:13:06,860
So? It's good.

1134
01:13:14,215 --> 01:13:16,261
Yeah. I feel like
I should have the...

1135
01:13:18,959 --> 01:13:20,396
You look like a teacher.

1136
01:13:20,439 --> 01:13:21,440
You know?

1137
01:13:35,454 --> 01:13:36,890
You look like a princess.Stop.

1138
01:13:36,934 --> 01:13:38,457
You kinda look like Elsa.

1139
01:13:38,501 --> 01:13:39,502
Ooh.Yeah.

1140
01:13:39,545 --> 01:13:40,807
Ooh. I'll take that.

1141
01:13:46,987 --> 01:13:48,467
That should do it.

1142
01:13:57,128 --> 01:13:58,999
Sophie Green is dead.

1143
01:14:01,045 --> 01:14:02,960
She sure is.

1144
01:14:03,003 --> 01:14:04,396
I'm gonna miss you.

1145
01:14:05,658 --> 01:14:06,790
I'm gonna miss you too.

1146
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:13,927
Don't you dare start crying 'cause
I'll have to redo your makeup, okay?

1147
01:14:13,971 --> 01:14:15,799
Okay.Okay.

1148
01:14:18,236 --> 01:14:20,064
Are you hungry? Starving.

1149
01:14:20,107 --> 01:14:21,805
I'll go make us some lunch.

1150
01:14:30,161 --> 01:14:33,077
Melissa. I need your opinion.

1151
01:14:35,819 --> 01:14:37,516
I don't really
like this eye shadow.

1152
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:39,997
You'll get used to it.

1153
01:14:45,002 --> 01:14:47,526
I am not gonna lie.
I am loving this...

1154
01:14:47,570 --> 01:14:49,485
Melissa!

1155
01:14:49,528 --> 01:14:51,269
Sophie? Are you all right?

1156
01:14:51,312 --> 01:14:52,879
Wait.

1157
01:14:52,923 --> 01:14:58,537
You know, I understand
why Sophie hates me. I get it.

1158
01:14:58,581 --> 01:15:00,844
But all I ever
did to you was love you.

1159
01:15:00,887 --> 01:15:02,541
Just let her go. Why'd you do it?

1160
01:15:02,585 --> 01:15:04,325
Why'd you do it?

1161
01:15:04,369 --> 01:15:07,067
Answer me! Or she dies.

1162
01:15:09,766 --> 01:15:11,376
Sophie and I...

1163
01:15:11,419 --> 01:15:15,032
Sophie and I have been best friends
since we were six years old.

1164
01:15:15,075 --> 01:15:18,296
And even though my family left
LA when I started high school,

1165
01:15:18,339 --> 01:15:20,298
I've always
considered her my sister.

1166
01:15:22,474 --> 01:15:25,564
After she lost her court case against
you, she came to me,

1167
01:15:25,608 --> 01:15:27,044
asked for my help.

1168
01:15:27,087 --> 01:15:28,698
Of course I said yes.

1169
01:15:29,916 --> 01:15:32,702
We researched the Internet
and learned how to make a bomb.

1170
01:15:32,745 --> 01:15:34,355
It's actually too easy.

1171
01:15:34,399 --> 01:15:37,881
I got a cadaver from the anatomy
lab at the medical school.

1172
01:15:37,924 --> 01:15:40,318
And while I was begging
you not to kill her,

1173
01:15:40,361 --> 01:15:43,277
Sophie put her dead double
behind the wheel of her car.

1174
01:15:43,321 --> 01:15:45,062
And then she set the bomb to blow.

1175
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:48,084
Melissa, what are
you doing here?

1176
01:15:48,108 --> 01:15:49,545
Forgive me.

1177
01:15:52,330 --> 01:15:53,940
Sophie pressed her car alarm,

1178
01:15:53,984 --> 01:15:56,595
and that was my cue to shoot the gas tank.

1179
01:15:59,163 --> 01:16:00,904
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1180
01:16:00,947 --> 01:16:03,167
I guess
I shot the gas tank. Let's go, let's go.

1181
01:16:03,210 --> 01:16:07,040
- Genius. -While you and I were
getting rid of the pistol,

1182
01:16:07,084 --> 01:16:10,043
Sophie borrowed one from your
playbook, Dr. Beck.

1183
01:16:10,087 --> 01:16:11,610
With the help of a family friend,

1184
01:16:11,654 --> 01:16:14,047
she snuck into the county coroner's office,

1185
01:16:14,091 --> 01:16:15,527
went to the computer,

1186
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:18,269
and made sure the cadaver's
dental records matched hers.

1187
01:16:19,792 --> 01:16:22,142
Sophie told me how you
tied her up two years ago,

1188
01:16:22,186 --> 01:16:24,231
so I matched that exactly.

1189
01:16:31,412 --> 01:16:33,240
What's with the disguise?

1190
01:16:33,284 --> 01:16:35,939
Well, we can't exactly
frame you for murder

1191
01:16:35,982 --> 01:16:37,680
if your victim's
still alive, right?

1192
01:16:37,723 --> 01:16:40,117
So Sophie's gonna spend
the rest of her life in hiding

1193
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:42,206
just so you can rot in jail.

1194
01:16:42,249 --> 01:16:44,643
And you did all this

1195
01:16:44,687 --> 01:16:49,213
because she is your best friend.

1196
01:16:49,256 --> 01:16:51,128
And there's one more reason.

1197
01:16:51,171 --> 01:16:53,957
I did this because
I'm gonna be a doctor,

1198
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,915
and you're an embarrassment
to my profession.

1199
01:16:55,959 --> 01:16:58,614
You shouldn't have said that.

1200
01:17:40,264 --> 01:17:43,180
Welcome to Cardiological
Systems 101-B.

1201
01:17:43,223 --> 01:17:45,530
I am Dr. Albert Beck.

1202
01:17:45,573 --> 01:17:46,923
And today...

1203
01:17:46,966 --> 01:17:49,490
we will be performing a double
open-heart transplant.

1204
01:17:49,534 --> 01:17:52,972
Let's talk about why these girls
are undergoing surgery today.

1205
01:17:53,016 --> 01:17:57,847
Basically, both these women suffer from
what we call cardio "treacheritis."

1206
01:17:57,890 --> 01:17:59,675
Cardio meaning "heart,"
of course.

1207
01:17:59,718 --> 01:18:03,896
And "treacheritis" meaning,
well...

1208
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:04,984
treacherous.

1209
01:18:05,028 --> 01:18:06,333
In plain English...

1210
01:18:06,377 --> 01:18:09,249
these girls are born
with evil duplicitous hearts.

1211
01:18:09,293 --> 01:18:13,689
So today, I am going to saw
through their breastbones,

1212
01:18:13,732 --> 01:18:16,779
rip open their rib cages
and surgically remove

1213
01:18:16,822 --> 01:18:18,955
their beating hearts.

1214
01:18:18,998 --> 01:18:20,739
I will heal them.

1215
01:18:20,783 --> 01:18:25,701
Well, how do you heal
treacherous hearts, Dr. Beck?

1216
01:18:26,789 --> 01:18:27,920
Anybody?

1217
01:18:30,096 --> 01:18:31,489
No?

1218
01:18:31,532 --> 01:18:36,059
By giving them
all the love I possibly can.

1219
01:18:36,102 --> 01:18:38,148
And once their hearts
are pure again,

1220
01:18:38,191 --> 01:18:41,804
I will transplant Melissa's
clean heart into Sophie's body.

1221
01:18:41,847 --> 01:18:46,373
Because nobody has ever
loved me like Melissa.

1222
01:18:49,333 --> 01:18:54,120
And then, I will transplant Sophie's
clean heart into Melissa's body.

1223
01:18:54,164 --> 01:18:57,950
Because deep down, I know Sophie's
grateful to me for saving her life.

1224
01:18:57,994 --> 01:19:02,215
Finally, once the new healthy hearts
have adapted to the new bodies,

1225
01:19:02,259 --> 01:19:07,873
both Sophie and Melissa
will love me unconditionally.

1226
01:19:07,917 --> 01:19:11,137
And the three of us
will live happily ever after

1227
01:19:11,181 --> 01:19:14,706
in my hacienda grande
in Cabo San Lucas.

1228
01:19:20,233 --> 01:19:23,802
All right. Now it's time to
inject the anesthetic into Melissa

1229
01:19:23,846 --> 01:19:26,413
so she sleeps during
the removal of her heart

1230
01:19:26,457 --> 01:19:28,894
from her chest cavity.

1231
01:19:28,938 --> 01:19:31,723
Wait. I'm sorry.

1232
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:33,116
I'm sorry, okay?

1233
01:19:33,159 --> 01:19:35,292
No, you're not sorry.

1234
01:19:35,335 --> 01:19:36,815
And you made that quite obvious.

1235
01:19:36,859 --> 01:19:38,904
Sophie forced me
to betray you, I swear.

1236
01:19:38,948 --> 01:19:40,993
No, she didn't.

1237
01:19:41,037 --> 01:19:43,909
No, I just... I wanna
make love to you again.

1238
01:19:43,953 --> 01:19:45,911
No man has ever loved me
like you love me.

1239
01:19:45,955 --> 01:19:48,784
So you'll untie me?

1240
01:19:48,827 --> 01:19:51,743
And take me to the bedroom
and love me like you used to?

1241
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:54,354
- I will.
- Thank you.

1242
01:19:54,398 --> 01:19:57,357
After the surgery.

1243
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:01,927
My God.

1244
01:20:03,407 --> 01:20:04,495
Ooh!

1245
01:20:10,544 --> 01:20:12,504
911. What's your emergency?
Help! Send the police!

1246
01:20:13,112 --> 01:20:15,375
He's trying to kill me!

1247
01:20:33,916 --> 01:20:37,441
I know where you are, Melissa.

1248
01:20:37,484 --> 01:20:40,836
You're very sick,
but you can be cured,

1249
01:20:40,879 --> 01:20:43,664
if you just let me operate.

1250
01:20:43,708 --> 01:20:47,538
So give me your hand...
and let's go to surgery.

1251
01:20:50,933 --> 01:20:52,978
I'm not sick.

1252
01:20:53,022 --> 01:20:54,066
You are.

1253
01:21:21,093 --> 01:21:22,660
Quick.
It's Dr. Albert Beck.

1254
01:21:22,703 --> 01:21:24,836
He's in the back bedroom.
That way.

1255
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:25,881
That way.

1256
01:21:35,281 --> 01:21:37,675
He got away? How could you
have let him get by you?

1257
01:21:37,718 --> 01:21:41,635
- Melissa, calm down. - We've got a road
block on every major highway in the state.

1258
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:43,637
- Don't worry.
- We'll find him.

1259
01:21:43,681 --> 01:21:46,205
And we'll make sure he spends
the rest of his life in jail.

1260
01:21:46,249 --> 01:21:48,425
Yeah. Right.

1261
01:21:49,992 --> 01:21:51,994
That's what you said last time.

1262
01:21:52,037 --> 01:21:55,388
Last time around, Detective
Sandler and I weren't on the case.

1263
01:21:55,432 --> 01:21:58,652
- We are now. -I'm sorry, ma'am.
We didn't get your name.

1264
01:21:58,696 --> 01:22:00,480
I'm So...

1265
01:22:00,524 --> 01:22:03,744
Susan. Susan Brown.

1266
01:22:03,788 --> 01:22:07,357
- You look familiar.
- She sure does.

1267
01:22:13,102 --> 01:22:14,930
You're Sophie Green.

1268
01:22:17,019 --> 01:22:19,108
Aren't you supposed to be dead?

1269
01:22:19,151 --> 01:22:22,981
Well you see, um,
here's the thing.

1270
01:22:50,269 --> 01:22:52,358
I still think
it could've worked out.

1271
01:22:56,101 --> 01:22:57,711
Stop the car.

1272
01:23:07,504 --> 01:23:10,898
These girls are
totally wrong for you, man!

1273
01:23:10,942 --> 01:23:15,642
I don't think so. I think they're
just, you know, inexperienced.

1274
01:23:15,686 --> 01:23:17,905
You are impossible.

1275
01:23:17,949 --> 01:23:19,211
No, no, listen. Listen.

1276
01:23:20,082 --> 01:23:22,214
Look. Listen.

1277
01:23:22,258 --> 01:23:26,392
Once they allow themselves, you know, to get
to know me, they'll fall in love with me.

1278
01:23:26,436 --> 01:23:27,480
I know they will.

1279
01:23:27,524 --> 01:23:29,004
What the hell does it take, man?

1280
01:23:29,047 --> 01:23:31,397
How many times do you need
to go through this?

1281
01:23:31,441 --> 01:23:33,138
How many girls
need to try to kill you

1282
01:23:33,182 --> 01:23:35,923
before you realize
you need to stay away from them?

1283
01:23:35,967 --> 01:23:37,292
And I'm not just talking
young girls.

1284
01:23:37,316 --> 01:23:40,493
All women, you smug face.

1285
01:23:40,537 --> 01:23:43,453
Man, you're not equipped to be
in a relationship with a female.

1286
01:23:43,496 --> 01:23:46,804
So do yourself a favor.
In fact, do us all a favor.

1287
01:23:46,847 --> 01:23:48,893
Buy yourself a beach house
in Costa Rica

1288
01:23:48,936 --> 01:23:50,721
and live out the rest
of your days alone.

1289
01:23:50,764 --> 01:23:51,983
You feel me?

1290
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:52,897
Alone.

1291
01:23:52,940 --> 01:23:54,638
A-L-O-N-E.

1292
01:23:54,681 --> 01:23:57,771
No chicks. No señoritas. Nada.
You got me?

1293
01:23:59,077 --> 01:24:01,906
I don't know...
I don't know if I can do that.

1294
01:24:01,949 --> 01:24:04,909
I know it's
a lousy retirement plan.

1295
01:24:04,952 --> 01:24:08,217
But you have to do it, buddy.
You have to.

1296
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:12,699
No! No, no, no, no, no!
No, no, no!

1297
01:24:12,743 --> 01:24:14,397
No! No!

1298
01:24:17,922 --> 01:24:21,317
I'm leaving you here!
I'm done with you!

1299
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:25,408
And if you think for one millisecond
I'm gonna give up on love,

1300
01:24:25,451 --> 01:24:26,931
you're wrong, my friend.

1301
01:24:26,974 --> 01:24:29,673
'Cause she's out there.
My baby's out there.

1302
01:24:29,716 --> 01:24:31,240
And I'm gonna find her.

1303
01:24:49,867 --> 01:24:51,956
Man, man, man.

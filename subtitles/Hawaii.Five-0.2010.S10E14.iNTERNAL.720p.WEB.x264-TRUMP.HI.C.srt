Eddie!

3
00:00:11,421 --> 00:00:13,695
Eddie! Stop! Stop right there.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,921
Eddie, no! No!

5
00:00:14,946 --> 00:00:16,213
(tires screeching)

6
00:00:16,238 --> 00:00:18,172
Hey... no, no! Eddie! Eddie!

7
00:00:18,197 --> 00:00:19,731
Ed... Eddie! Eddie!

8
00:00:21,102 --> 00:00:22,669
(horn honks)

9
00:00:24,138 --> 00:00:25,205
Eddie.

10
00:00:25,273 --> 00:00:27,975
- (shushing)
- (Eddie whimpering)

11
00:00:28,042 --> 00:00:29,910
I got you. I got you, buddy.

12
00:00:29,935 --> 00:00:32,536
I'm right here. I'm right here.

13
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:35,291
What the hell got into you, buddy?

I have a question.

26
00:01:40,257 --> 00:01:42,511
Why would a guy come to a bar

27
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:44,471
and order a club soda?

28
00:01:45,507 --> 00:01:47,442
I don't know. Uh, it's 10:00 a.m.?

29
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:48,907
That doesn't stop people at airports.

30
00:01:49,633 --> 00:01:51,501
Oh, so you've been watching me?

31
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:55,472
No. You are sitting underneath the TV,

32
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:56,987
- and I've been watching that.
- Ah.

33
00:01:57,019 --> 00:01:58,220
But it did have me wonder,

34
00:01:58,294 --> 00:02:00,362
because there are a lot
of places a guy could go

35
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:02,972
- to get a glass of carbonated water...
- Mm.

36
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:05,583
But you came to a bar, and
so you want to be drinking,

37
00:02:05,962 --> 00:02:07,706
but instead you're staring
at a cup of club soda.

38
00:02:07,731 --> 00:02:09,464
Are you, are you the beverage police?

39
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:10,790
Yes, I am.

40
00:02:11,792 --> 00:02:13,034
And I'm writing you up.

41
00:02:13,177 --> 00:02:15,545
(both laugh)

42
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,964
You, uh...

43
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:19,472
I-I do, I do, uh, drink alcohol,

44
00:02:19,497 --> 00:02:20,998
too, sometimes.

45
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,097
Would you like to sit?

46
00:02:23,122 --> 00:02:24,923
- Yeah. Okay.
- Yeah?

47
00:02:25,181 --> 00:02:26,681
Please. If you insist.

48
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:29,417
Are we gonna drink alcohol?

49
00:02:29,485 --> 00:02:31,981
I mean, it's not the airport,
but I'll give it a shot

50
00:02:32,006 --> 00:02:33,673
- if you want, yeah.
- All right.

51
00:02:33,698 --> 00:02:34,898
- Hi.
- EKA: Hi.

52
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:37,439
- What can I get for you?
- Hi. He's gonna have an Irish Mule,

53
00:02:37,464 --> 00:02:38,994
- and I...
- Wha-

54
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:40,362
Hold on. Uh, what's a...

55
00:02:40,429 --> 00:02:41,863
- what's an Irish Mule?
- Oh, no.

56
00:02:41,888 --> 00:02:44,097
- You'll like it. It's good.
- Maybe I want a Scotch.

57
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,995
Maybe this isn't about
what you want and maybe

58
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,268
this is about what you need.

59
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:48,502
(Eka chuckles)

60
00:02:48,527 --> 00:02:49,760
I'd listen to the lady.

61
00:02:49,785 --> 00:02:51,482
Sounds like she knows
what she's talking about.

62
00:02:51,507 --> 00:02:53,742
Yeah, she does, but,
um, I-I don't even know

63
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:57,427
- what is in an Irish Mule.
- (sighs) He's always like this.

64
00:02:57,452 --> 00:02:59,323
I'm sure he's always like this.

65
00:02:59,348 --> 00:03:00,659
EKA: The ginger in the ginger beer

66
00:03:00,683 --> 00:03:02,339
is gonna help improve
your brain function.

67
00:03:02,364 --> 00:03:04,576
Which will maybe bring you
back to the land of the living.

68
00:03:04,864 --> 00:03:06,764
And the whiskey, well,
that is nothing less

69
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:08,767
than a time-honored tradition
to elevate one's mood.

70
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,511
- Aha.
- Mm-hmm.

71
00:03:10,536 --> 00:03:12,496
- Two Irish Mules, then.
- Actually, that's too sweet for me.

72
00:03:12,528 --> 00:03:15,053
- I'm gonna have a Scotch. Neat.
- You got it.

73
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,974
You're very funny.

74
00:03:16,999 --> 00:03:19,034
Mm-hmm. What's your name?

75
00:03:19,101 --> 00:03:20,669
Oh, God, that's so cliché.

76
00:03:20,736 --> 00:03:22,047
Really, you're gonna
meet someone at a bar,

77
00:03:22,071 --> 00:03:23,215
and that's your opening line?

78
00:03:23,557 --> 00:03:25,407
I just, I feel like
you're the type of guy

79
00:03:25,474 --> 00:03:26,585
who comes up with
something more original.

80
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:29,010
I-I generally would
be that type of guy.

81
00:03:29,035 --> 00:03:30,846
Maybe I get a drink in
me first and that'll help.

82
00:03:30,913 --> 00:03:33,464
Hmm. I'll allow it.

83
00:03:33,653 --> 00:03:35,120
- You will. Nice.
- Yes.

84
00:03:35,251 --> 00:03:36,852
Nice. This will be a two-way street.

85
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,997
I will not ask you your name,
I will not ask you what you do.

86
00:03:39,021 --> 00:03:40,488
And...

87
00:03:40,513 --> 00:03:42,366
we will think of only interesting

88
00:03:42,391 --> 00:03:44,226
- and original things to talk about.
- Okay.

89
00:03:44,251 --> 00:03:46,653
- (phone ringing)
- We will do that, um...

90
00:03:46,678 --> 00:03:48,513
Right after you take that.

91
00:03:48,622 --> 00:03:51,191
It's-it's a work thing. I-I
promise I'll be right back.

92
00:03:51,216 --> 00:03:52,460
- Mm.
- If you touch my Irish Mule,

93
00:03:52,493 --> 00:03:54,628
I'll, um, I'll do
something terrible. Okay?

94
00:03:54,653 --> 00:03:56,588
Give me one second.

95
00:03:56,772 --> 00:03:59,875
Hey. Um, I'm... Just, quick question:

96
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,368
um, how am I supposed to
have a couple personal days

97
00:04:02,393 --> 00:04:03,830
if you keep calling me all the time?

98
00:04:03,855 --> 00:04:06,354
STEVE: Relax. It's not a work
thing. I'm just checking in with you.

99
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,793
I'm-I'm doing fine.
But, hey, I-I did,

100
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:11,096
I called Adam again, a-and it
went straight to voice mail.

101
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,425
All right, so I'm thinking, Mm-hmm.

102
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,487
Usually it rings a couple times,
then it goes to voice mail.

103
00:04:14,512 --> 00:04:17,481
So, when-when in life do
you turn your phone off?

104
00:04:17,901 --> 00:04:20,556
I don't know. Uh, when
I'm on a plane, I guess.

105
00:04:20,581 --> 00:04:22,831
That's right. Right, so
maybe he's on his way back

106
00:04:22,856 --> 00:04:23,956
from wherever he was.

107
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:25,816
- Yeah, it's possible. (shushes)
- (whines)

108
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:27,375
Hang on. You're okay, you're okay.

109
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,413
(shushes) It's all
right. It's all right.

110
00:04:29,438 --> 00:04:31,948
How's Eddie doing?
Uh, he seemed a little off when I left.

111
00:04:31,973 --> 00:04:33,874
No, he's worse than "off."

112
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,122
He took off from the house, ran
into traffic on Kalanianaole.

113
00:04:36,146 --> 00:04:37,595
I just pulled him out.

114
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,658
- You need a hand?
- No, no, no, I'm good.

115
00:04:39,683 --> 00:04:41,486
I got the vet coming by pretty soon.

116
00:04:41,511 --> 00:04:43,533
Is that the vet, the nice vet lady

117
00:04:43,558 --> 00:04:45,261
that you took out on a date
and it went really great

118
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:47,909
and you didn't ask her out again
because you're insane or something?

119
00:04:47,934 --> 00:04:50,050
Yes, her. Listen, uh...

120
00:04:50,075 --> 00:04:51,476
after I'm done here, I'm gonna go

121
00:04:51,501 --> 00:04:53,469
grab a bite to eat. You want to join me?

122
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:55,331
Uh, no, I don't want
to have a bite with you.

123
00:04:55,356 --> 00:04:56,972
In fact, I am sitting at a bar right now

124
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:58,965
with a very pretty lady.

125
00:04:59,304 --> 00:05:01,222
What are you doing talking
to me? Are you crazy?

126
00:05:01,247 --> 00:05:03,615
Listen to me, Danny, don't
blow this very rare opportunity

127
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,091
that a w... a female wants
to converse with you.

128
00:05:06,116 --> 00:05:07,972
Get this... she actually came up to me.

129
00:05:07,997 --> 00:05:09,526
Oh, wait, is she a bartender?

130
00:05:09,551 --> 00:05:11,769
'Cause you know that
she has to talk to you.

131
00:05:11,931 --> 00:05:13,629
If that's the case, that's her job.

132
00:05:13,654 --> 00:05:15,237
Tell Eddie I love him. Okay? Goodbye.

133
00:05:15,262 --> 00:05:17,263
Very sorry. Sorry, sorry.

134
00:05:17,288 --> 00:05:18,886
It's fine. Is everything okay?

135
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:20,534
- Yeah, everything's good.
- Okay.

136
00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:22,120
Ah. Ahoy.

137
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,340
- All right. Down the hatch.
- All right.

138
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,133
- Cheers.
- Yep.

139
00:05:28,065 --> 00:05:32,329
- Mmm.
- That's a lot. It's, uh, it's good.

140
00:05:32,354 --> 00:05:35,291
So, how-how are you
liking the island so far?

141
00:05:36,276 --> 00:05:38,108
- So far?
- Mm-hmm.

142
00:05:38,176 --> 00:05:40,948
- What makes you think I'm new here?
- Oh, well, the outfit, for one.

143
00:05:41,526 --> 00:05:43,313
Which I like very much.

144
00:05:43,381 --> 00:05:44,882
It's very classy. You look fantastic.

145
00:05:44,907 --> 00:05:46,626
But it's very East Coast.

146
00:05:46,651 --> 00:05:49,787
And you look like, uh, you know,
you'd be gainfully employed,

147
00:05:50,386 --> 00:05:52,290
but, uh, we're at a bar, not an office.

148
00:05:52,315 --> 00:05:54,000
- Thank you.
- So here-here's what I'm thinking.

149
00:05:54,025 --> 00:05:56,876
I'm thinking either you,
um, you got a new gig,

150
00:05:56,901 --> 00:05:59,496
flew out here for it, it hasn't
started yet, or you-you know,

151
00:05:59,564 --> 00:06:01,498
you're doing, like, half-days

152
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,310
while you, while y-you
get yourself settled.

153
00:06:04,335 --> 00:06:06,069
How am I doing? Warm? Hot? Cold?

154
00:06:06,137 --> 00:06:08,806
- Yeah, I think you're pretty warm.
- Thanks.

155
00:06:08,873 --> 00:06:12,767
So are you, like... you're, like,
a detective or something?

156
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:14,821
- Something like that.
- (laughs)

157
00:06:16,406 --> 00:06:18,507
Can I tell you things? Can I be honest?

158
00:06:18,532 --> 00:06:20,833
- Please.
- I'm not,

159
00:06:21,323 --> 00:06:23,253
I'm not too sure about this place.

160
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:25,923
Not... The, um, the island.

161
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,525
Ah. I understand.

162
00:06:29,065 --> 00:06:31,417
And, uh, I felt the same
way when I first got here,

163
00:06:31,442 --> 00:06:33,664
but... it grows on you.

164
00:06:33,731 --> 00:06:37,401
- Right. I'll believe that.
- Mm-hmm.

165
00:06:47,004 --> 00:06:48,071
(laughs)

166
00:06:51,905 --> 00:06:53,206
(moaning)

167
00:06:55,511 --> 00:06:59,323
- DANNY: That was, uh...
- Yeah, it was.

168
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,291
For the record... not that, uh,

169
00:07:01,359 --> 00:07:02,536
you're keeping a record or anything...

170
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,742
- (laughs)
- but, uh, I've never done

171
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:06,368
this before.

172
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,955
- Yeah. Me, neither.
- Oh, that's good.

173
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,271
Um...

174
00:07:14,331 --> 00:07:15,741
I don't know, if you're
up for it sometime, maybe

175
00:07:15,773 --> 00:07:17,485
I'd like to take you out to
dinner or something like that?

176
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:19,520
- (laughs): Take me out to dinner?
- Yeah, something like that.

177
00:07:19,544 --> 00:07:22,613
Yes, I would, um, I
would like that very much.

178
00:07:22,722 --> 00:07:25,516
- (quietly): Good.
- Good.

179
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,885
Just, um...

180
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:30,521
- What-what are you doing?
- I'm calling a Lyft.

181
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,764
Oh, why you calling a Lyft?

182
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:33,765
I think, I think I could
give you a ride home.

183
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:36,125
- Oh, you could give me a ride?
- Mm-hmm.

184
00:07:36,661 --> 00:07:37,838
You don't, you don't have to do that.

185
00:07:37,862 --> 00:07:39,329
I know, I'd like to do that.

186
00:07:39,397 --> 00:07:41,236
Uh, and I had one sip of that drink.

187
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,054
Yes. I know, you did not like that.

188
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,613
It was okay.

189
00:07:45,603 --> 00:07:47,363
I guess I'm gonna get
in a strange man's car.

190
00:07:47,405 --> 00:07:49,416
You are gonna get in a
strange man's midsize rental.

191
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,440
- Wow.
- Yeah.

192
00:07:50,508 --> 00:07:51,752
- A midsize rental.
- Yeah. But it came

193
00:07:51,776 --> 00:07:54,806
with a beautiful, uh,
tropical air freshener.

194
00:07:54,831 --> 00:07:57,758
Wow. Uh, you know, on second thought,
I'll probably just take the bus.

195
00:07:57,782 --> 00:07:59,349
- Shut up.
- (laughs)

196
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:00,918
- (lock clicks)
- Whoa, hey.

197
00:08:00,985 --> 00:08:02,986
- What?
- You trying to get busted?

198
00:08:03,054 --> 00:08:04,858
Let me just make sure
the coast is clear.

199
00:08:04,883 --> 00:08:06,417
Frickin' amateur hour over here.

200
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:08,210
(chuckles): Sorry, sorry.

201

00:08:39,022 --> 00:08:40,389
it was pretty cool

212
00:08:40,414 --> 00:08:41,591
'cause it's about a half a block away

213
00:08:41,616 --> 00:08:44,222
from where Benny Agbayani
went to high school.

214
00:08:44,247 --> 00:08:46,482
Okay, stop everything right now.

215
00:08:46,507 --> 00:08:47,908
Did you just name-drop

216
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:49,690
late-90s Mets outfielder
Benny Agbayani?

217
00:08:49,715 --> 00:08:51,816
- Wow.
- (laughs) You got that reference.

218
00:08:51,841 --> 00:08:53,909
Yeah... Me? I'm-I'm...
The Hawaiian Punch?

219
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,001
I was at the game.

220
00:08:55,026 --> 00:08:56,604
- No, you were not. You were not.
- Yes, I was.

221
00:08:56,629 --> 00:08:58,063
- Don't... No. No.
- I'm telling you,

222
00:08:58,088 --> 00:08:59,284
it was the craziest
thing I've ever seen live.

223
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:01,058
I'm telling you, it
was, it was, it was nuts.

224
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,579
That's crazy. Thought
it was the third out.

225
00:09:02,604 --> 00:09:04,220
- Yeah.
- Ah, I knew

226
00:09:04,245 --> 00:09:06,174
you were from the East Coast.
You're from the East Coast.

227
00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:08,979
Okay, I think that
you are from... Jersey.

228
00:09:09,004 --> 00:09:11,539
- Yes, I am. Yes, I am.
- I love Jersey.

229
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,351
That makes two of us.

230
00:09:13,376 --> 00:09:14,901
Well, I'm from Massapequa.

231
00:09:15,475 --> 00:09:17,819
- All right. Strong Island.
- But I love Passaic.

232
00:09:17,844 --> 00:09:19,712
My-my favorite aunt lived there.

233
00:09:19,737 --> 00:09:20,937
- Okay.
- Yeah, it was the best.

234
00:09:20,962 --> 00:09:24,064
I'd go see her and we'd
watch R-rated movies

235
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:25,856
and we'd order sausage
pizza from Romeo's.

236
00:09:25,911 --> 00:09:29,681
Romeo's. Well, your
aunt has very good taste.

237
00:09:35,962 --> 00:09:37,714
He sees us, right?

238
00:09:38,398 --> 00:09:39,631
- Hey...
- Hold on.

239
00:09:39,656 --> 00:09:40,790
- (horn honks)
- (tires screeching)

240
00:09:40,815 --> 00:09:41,849
Oh, my God!

241
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:00,073
(both grunting, groaning)

242
00:10:05,883 --> 00:10:07,963
(doorbell rings)

243
00:10:09,298 --> 00:10:10,765
Doc, hey. Thanks so much.

244
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,190
Uh, come in, come in.

245
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:16,406
Um, I know you don't
usually do house calls.

246
00:10:16,431 --> 00:10:18,031
Yeah, no, I don't,
but it sounded urgent.

247
00:10:18,063 --> 00:10:19,397
- Where is he?
- He's in the kitchen.

248
00:10:19,465 --> 00:10:21,562
Small confined space,
right? Like you said.

249
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,766
Yeah, good. Oh, well, uh... whoa.

250
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:24,824
Probably, it's...

251
00:10:24,849 --> 00:10:27,828
probably best if I conduct
my initial exam without you.

252
00:10:27,853 --> 00:10:30,531
It's just that dogs, they
pick up on our anxiety and...

253
00:10:30,556 --> 00:10:32,203
Yeah, I got a little
bit of that today. Yeah.

254
00:10:32,228 --> 00:10:33,461
Um, just so you know,

255
00:10:33,486 --> 00:10:37,163
uh, what's been going on
lately, has been, uh, bizarre.

256
00:10:37,188 --> 00:10:38,844
- I mean, he's not himself.
- How so?

257
00:10:38,869 --> 00:10:40,313
-  What do you mean?
- Well, he's kind of s...

258
00:10:40,338 --> 00:10:41,682
He's skittish and jumpy, he's, like,

259
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:43,274
on high alert all the time.

260
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:45,906
And you know Eddie. He's a relaxed guy.

261
00:10:45,931 --> 00:10:48,065
Right? I mean, at the moment, I can't,

262
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,491
I can't close a drawer
in the, in the bedroom

263
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:51,727
without him totally freaking out.

264
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:53,824
And this morning, the door
was cracked a little bit.

265
00:10:53,849 --> 00:10:55,369
He bolted. He's never done that before.

266
00:10:55,394 --> 00:10:58,096
He ended up in the
middle of Kalanianaole.

267
00:10:58,121 --> 00:11:00,508
Almost got us both killed
pulling him out of that traffic.

268
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,172
Well, uh, how about I
go take a look at him?

269
00:11:03,197 --> 00:11:05,432
Yeah, yeah; yeah, yeah. Okay.

270
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:09,468
Hey, there, Eddie.

271
00:11:09,493 --> 00:11:11,914
Remember me? Stitched you up

272
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:13,422
a little while back?

273
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:18,744
Okay... it's maybe not
the most pleasant of memories.

274
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:21,032
Right? I thought we had a
little bit of a bond, hmm?

275
00:11:21,057 --> 00:11:23,524
Now let's see what's
going on with you, bud.

276
00:11:25,868 --> 00:11:28,211
Come on. Let's see, bud...

277
00:11:28,236 --> 00:11:29,870
Good boy...

278
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:36,386
All right. Let's just
check those pearly whites...

279
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:40,265
All right. Good boy.

280
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,868
Good boy.

281
00:11:44,777 --> 00:11:46,711
(both groaning)

282
00:11:52,453 --> 00:11:54,387
(groans) Uh, hey...

283
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,539
- Look at me. You okay?
- Yeah...

284
00:11:57,564 --> 00:11:59,698
- Look at me.
- Uh, it hurts...

285
00:11:59,723 --> 00:12:01,328
All right. It hurts.

286
00:12:01,577 --> 00:12:04,011
Okay. I'm gonna get my phone, all right?

287
00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:08,618
(exhales)

288
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,820
Hey.

289
00:12:09,868 --> 00:12:11,368
- Mm-hmm?
- Where's your phone?

290
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:15,540
Uh, it's in my, um, it's in my bag.

291
00:12:15,565 --> 00:12:18,130
(grunts)

292
00:12:18,548 --> 00:12:22,150
(Leslie panting)

293
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,528
LESLIE: Oh, God, my legs...

294
00:12:28,553 --> 00:12:30,688
God, it hurts.

295
00:12:33,096 --> 00:12:34,964
Okay.

296
00:12:34,989 --> 00:12:36,489
All right.

297
00:12:36,921 --> 00:12:38,855
We got no service. I'm gonna...

298
00:12:39,107 --> 00:12:40,774
I'm gonna go up to the road,

299
00:12:41,532 --> 00:12:44,168
- try to get a signal, okay?
- Mm-hmm...

300
00:12:44,602 --> 00:12:46,003
All right?

301
00:12:46,028 --> 00:12:47,428
(exhales sharply) Okay.

302
00:12:47,453 --> 00:12:49,220
We're gonna be fine,
all right? I promise.

303
00:12:49,249 --> 00:12:50,549
Sorry.

304
00:12:50,742 --> 00:12:54,311
- Huh?
- Mm...

305
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:56,881
Seven-two-four.

306
00:12:56,948 --> 00:12:59,216
- Huh?
- The, um... the last three digits...

307
00:12:59,241 --> 00:13:01,609
(exhales) ... of the plate
were seven, two, four.

308
00:13:01,763 --> 00:13:03,425
Don't worry about
that right now, okay?

309
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,056
You have to tell...
you have to tell the police,

310
00:13:06,081 --> 00:13:07,582
so that he doesn't hurt anyone.

311
00:13:07,724 --> 00:13:09,725
He already hurt somebody.

312
00:13:10,808 --> 00:13:12,408
Just...

313
00:13:12,433 --> 00:13:14,434
just breathe.

314
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:16,076
It's gonna be okay,
I promise, all right?

315
00:13:16,101 --> 00:13:17,821
Be right back.

316
00:13:17,853 --> 00:13:20,227
Seven-two-four, right?
Got it. Seven-two-four.

317
00:13:25,377 --> 00:13:29,446
(moans)

318
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,203
The door's jammed.

319
00:13:37,534 --> 00:13:40,403
(panting)

320
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:53,172
- Hey.
- Hey.

321
00:13:54,391 --> 00:13:56,715
He's showing signs of
post-traumatic stress.

322
00:13:56,818 --> 00:13:58,118
PTS?

323
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,377
Okay, h... I know military working dogs

324
00:14:00,402 --> 00:14:03,004
can get PTS, but he's
never shown a hint of that.

325
00:14:03,391 --> 00:14:05,492
Maybe so. But what he's
exhibiting right now,

326
00:14:05,517 --> 00:14:06,584
hyper-vigilance,

327
00:14:06,609 --> 00:14:08,410
an elevated heart rate, dilated pupils;

328
00:14:08,435 --> 00:14:10,046
- those are telltale signs.
- Doc, this doesn't

329
00:14:10,071 --> 00:14:11,791
make any sense. Uh,
look, after the Marines,

330
00:14:11,816 --> 00:14:14,384
he was with the DEA for years. Why now?

331
00:14:15,407 --> 00:14:19,396
Look, Steve, you and I both
know PTS is varied; it's complex.

332
00:14:19,463 --> 00:14:21,374
We understand very little
of how it affects humans,

333
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:22,733
much less dogs.

334
00:14:22,844 --> 00:14:24,044
I don't know; in my opinion,

335
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:26,937
I think that Eddie must
have some long-buried trauma

336
00:14:26,962 --> 00:14:29,406
that for some reason
has just resurfaced.

337
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,818
But I don't know. I'm not
an expert in this, so...

338
00:14:31,885 --> 00:14:34,047
sorry I... can't be more helpful.

339
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:36,323
No, no, you've been
plenty helpful, thank you.

340
00:14:36,348 --> 00:14:38,789
I'm, I'm just, you know...

341
00:14:41,252 --> 00:14:43,120
(exhales) Thank you.

342
00:14:43,145 --> 00:14:44,412
I mean...

343
00:14:46,355 --> 00:14:48,993
- I-I got a place to start now, right?
- Yeah.

344
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,426
Um, Emma, before you leave?

345
00:14:51,451 --> 00:14:53,602
I feel like I should
probably bring up the, uh...

346
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:56,195
How... how you never called me back?

347
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:57,801
- Yes. That.
- (chuckles)

348
00:14:57,912 --> 00:15:01,027
And, uh... first of all,
I'm really sorry.

349
00:15:01,052 --> 00:15:02,763
I just want to let you know that, uh,

350
00:15:02,788 --> 00:15:04,393
it wasn't because I didn't like you,

351
00:15:04,418 --> 00:15:06,853
'cause I did, I do. I mean...

352
00:15:08,644 --> 00:15:13,226
I have always had a problem
balancing the job with my life,

353
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:15,929
and... historically,

354
00:15:15,954 --> 00:15:18,822
uh, my personal life always
gets the short end of the stick,

355
00:15:18,847 --> 00:15:21,605
and I guess I just wanted
to let you know that, um...

356
00:15:22,603 --> 00:15:23,970
it wasn't a you issue.

357
00:15:23,995 --> 00:15:27,176
Uh... I'm the problem.

358
00:15:29,097 --> 00:15:31,544
Typically, when men say
something like that to me,

359
00:15:31,612 --> 00:15:32,679
I think about

360
00:15:32,704 --> 00:15:35,682
which shin I should kick. (chuckles)

361
00:15:35,707 --> 00:15:39,762
But... I don't know, for some reason,
when you say it, I believe you.

362
00:15:39,787 --> 00:15:42,122
Well, you should, 'cause it's the truth.

363
00:15:42,147 --> 00:15:45,582
Yeah. Hey, look,
there's no hard feelings.

364
00:15:45,692 --> 00:15:48,208
- 'Cause I'm seeing someone.
- That's great.

365
00:15:48,233 --> 00:15:49,796
Yeah, it turns out there
are some good guys

366
00:15:49,821 --> 00:15:51,355
on those godforsaken apps, so...

367
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,547
I'm legitimately happy
for you. You deserve it.

368
00:15:53,572 --> 00:15:54,939
Thanks.

369
00:15:55,449 --> 00:15:57,537
Anyway, I don't want
to hold you hostage.

370
00:15:57,562 --> 00:15:59,263
Thank you. Bye, Steve.

371
00:15:59,288 --> 00:16:01,285
Oh, and keep me posted on Eddie.

372
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,152
I will, I promise.
Thanks again, Emma.

373
00:16:03,177 --> 00:16:04,096
Yeah.

374
00:16:10,862 --> 00:16:12,830
(phone rings)

375
00:16:13,824 --> 00:16:15,188
Big man on campus.

376
00:16:15,213 --> 00:16:16,880
- How's Parents Weekend?
- GROVER: Expensive.

377
00:16:16,905 --> 00:16:18,873
Renee's got me running
all over the place

378
00:16:18,898 --> 00:16:20,409
running errands while she's helping Will

379
00:16:20,434 --> 00:16:22,772
decorate his new off-campus apartment.

380
00:16:22,797 --> 00:16:24,664
- Uh-huh.
- Boy, these kids now.

381
00:16:24,689 --> 00:16:26,623
Did you know, when I
went away to school,

382
00:16:26,648 --> 00:16:28,382
you know what my parents gave me?

383
00:16:28,407 --> 00:16:31,471
A ratty old blanket and a roll
of quarters for the pay phone

384
00:16:31,496 --> 00:16:32,563
and the laundromat.

385
00:16:33,222 --> 00:16:35,699
Now, Father of the Year,

386
00:16:35,724 --> 00:16:38,511
aka yours truly, is
going out to buy Will

387
00:16:38,536 --> 00:16:42,644
a... flat screen TV and a
portable air conditioning unit.

388
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,637
Come on, you love spoiling
that kid, you know it.

389
00:16:44,662 --> 00:16:47,113
Yeah, I know, but let
that be our little secret.

390
00:16:47,138 --> 00:16:48,472
Listen, the reason I'm calling you

391
00:16:48,989 --> 00:16:50,582
is because I got a text

392
00:16:50,607 --> 00:16:53,558
from Tani, and she said
that Eddie's in a bad way.

393
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:54,683
He's not doing too good.

394
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,238
The vet just left.

395
00:16:56,263 --> 00:16:57,530
She said she thinks it's PTS,

396
00:16:57,555 --> 00:16:58,699
but she's no expert.

397
00:16:58,724 --> 00:17:02,619
Well, fret not, pal of mine,
because I happen to know one.

398
00:17:02,644 --> 00:17:03,837
Will played high school baseball

399
00:17:03,862 --> 00:17:07,238
with the son of a
resident Army veterinarian.

400
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:11,211
And his primary expertise
is in military working dogs.

401
00:17:11,262 --> 00:17:13,370
- Are you kidding me right now?
- About Eddie?

402
00:17:13,447 --> 00:17:15,615
Bite your tongue, man. I love that dog,

403
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,207
so I reached out to him.

404
00:17:17,408 --> 00:17:20,177
And he thinks he can help.
His name is Dr. Art Currin.

405
00:17:20,245 --> 00:17:23,847
You'll find him at the
Veterinary Treatment Facility

406
00:17:23,872 --> 00:17:25,206
at Fort Shafter.

407
00:17:25,231 --> 00:17:27,332
And he's expecting you,
too. How about that?

408
00:17:27,357 --> 00:17:30,053
Thank you so much, Lou.
I really appreciate this.

409
00:17:30,078 --> 00:17:32,146
No problem, man. Anything for that pup.

410
00:17:32,561 --> 00:17:34,527
All right, I got to go.
I'm late for an argument.

411
00:17:38,408 --> 00:17:40,099
- (whimpers)
- Shh... you're okay.

412
00:17:40,124 --> 00:17:41,701
You're okay. You're okay.

413
00:18:08,495 --> 00:18:11,864
(Leslie groaning)

414
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:18,191
_

415
00:18:23,975 --> 00:18:27,845
- (whimpers)
- Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh.

416
00:18:28,738 --> 00:18:30,013
You were right to bring him in.

417
00:18:30,124 --> 00:18:32,959
Eddie is definitely
exhibiting signs of canine PTS.

418
00:18:32,984 --> 00:18:35,018
He recently suffer any trauma

419
00:18:35,043 --> 00:18:36,426
in the field?

420
00:18:36,888 --> 00:18:38,722
No. I mean, that's the thing.

421
00:18:38,747 --> 00:18:40,347
He's been, he's been with me for, uh,

422
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:41,525
couple years now, and

423
00:18:42,105 --> 00:18:45,405
he's been exposed to, to
gunshots, to explosions,

424
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,497
uh, he's-he's never had a bad reaction.

425
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:51,611
Before he came to me, he was a DEA dog.

426
00:18:51,636 --> 00:18:53,656
And then preceding that,
he was with a Marine unit

427
00:18:53,681 --> 00:18:54,981
in Afghanistan.

428
00:18:55,629 --> 00:18:57,507
I'm trying to think what I

429
00:18:57,532 --> 00:18:58,666
could have exposed him to.

430
00:18:58,691 --> 00:19:00,286
I've had a lot going
on in my personal life.

431
00:19:00,311 --> 00:19:02,880
I-I guess, uh...

432
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,824
It's killing me, Doc,
to think that maybe

433
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:06,750
I-I've exposed him to something...

434
00:19:07,199 --> 00:19:09,174
that's, that's, that's
had this reaction.

435
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:10,921
I can tell you're hurting.

436
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,233
You shouldn't beat yourself up.

437
00:19:13,258 --> 00:19:15,259
It's not uncommon for canine PTS

438
00:19:15,284 --> 00:19:19,806
to stay dormant for weeks,
months, sometimes years;

439
00:19:19,831 --> 00:19:21,598
lying dormant till
something sets it off.

440
00:19:21,623 --> 00:19:24,668
That something can be
a sound, sight, smell.

441
00:19:24,742 --> 00:19:26,913
Literally anything
can bring an old trauma

442
00:19:26,938 --> 00:19:28,138
back to the surface.

443
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,250
My guess, this didn't
happen because of something

444
00:19:30,275 --> 00:19:31,475
you exposed him to.

445
00:19:31,585 --> 00:19:34,254
You would have noticed the
signs immediately if you had.

446
00:19:34,457 --> 00:19:36,222
More likely, Eddie was alone

447
00:19:36,247 --> 00:19:37,714
when the triggering event happened;

448
00:19:37,824 --> 00:19:40,113
in your home, perhaps outside.

449
00:19:40,494 --> 00:19:42,462
It's not your fault, Commander.

450
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,821
- Now let's talk treatment.
- Mm.

451
00:19:44,889 --> 00:19:46,267
First, I'll administer an anxiolytic

452
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,316
to help with the underlying anxiety.

453
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,437
Honestly, the meds are just a band-aid.

454
00:19:51,808 --> 00:19:54,197
You're gonna have to figure
out exactly what triggered Eddie

455
00:19:54,222 --> 00:19:56,056
and remove it from his environment,

456
00:19:56,081 --> 00:19:59,545
or, frankly, his condition's
only gonna get worse.

457
00:19:59,808 --> 00:20:01,114
That said,

458
00:20:01,139 --> 00:20:03,573
you can't know what you need
to remove until you determine

459
00:20:03,641 --> 00:20:06,443
- the root cause of this trauma.
- Right.

460
00:20:06,468 --> 00:20:08,936
Lou tells me you're a
seasoned investigator.

461
00:20:09,301 --> 00:20:11,291
Something like that, yeah.

462
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:14,127
- It's time to investigate this.
- Understood.

463
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:16,863
Eddie's first handler...

464
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:18,831
he was killed in action in Afghanistan.

465
00:20:18,856 --> 00:20:21,896
- You know any details about how?
- No.

466
00:20:22,345 --> 00:20:24,237
Well, then I'd start there.

467
00:20:28,933 --> 00:20:32,436
- (phone rings)
- Steve. You got me and Quinn.

468
00:20:32,461 --> 00:20:33,795
How's the little man?

469
00:20:35,074 --> 00:20:36,616
He's all right. He's a little quiet.

470
00:20:36,641 --> 00:20:37,975
I think it's the meds.

471
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,768
So the Army vet was helpful?

472
00:20:39,877 --> 00:20:41,244
He was. He was very helpful.

473
00:20:41,312 --> 00:20:42,823
But, uh, Eddie's not
out of the woods yet.

474
00:20:42,847 --> 00:20:45,160
We still need to figure
out what triggered it.

475
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,393
So where do we start, boss?

476
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,054
We start by turning back the clock.

477
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:53,580
Eddie's first handler
was killed in action

478
00:20:53,605 --> 00:20:55,016
in Afghanistan. I
want to know everything

479
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,469
that happened that day. Okay?

480
00:20:56,494 --> 00:20:58,962
The doctor seems to think that
his trauma is rooted there,

481
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,574
so let's dig around
and see if we can find

482
00:21:00,598 --> 00:21:01,751
anything actionable.

483
00:21:01,776 --> 00:21:04,711
If we can't, look into his DEA history.

484
00:21:04,736 --> 00:21:06,536
But my gut says

485
00:21:06,561 --> 00:21:09,001
that the doctor's right, and
his trauma is linked to the death

486
00:21:09,026 --> 00:21:10,694
of his old handler.

487
00:21:10,719 --> 00:21:13,424
That was a one-of-a-kind
bond, and it got broken.

488
00:21:14,572 --> 00:21:16,658
In the meantime, I don't
want to leave him alone,

489
00:21:16,683 --> 00:21:18,349
so if you guys could do me a favor,

490
00:21:18,374 --> 00:21:21,209
I want you to go talk to
Colonel O'Donnell at MCBH.

491
00:21:21,234 --> 00:21:22,714
He should be able to put us in contact

492
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,473
- with Eddie's old unit.
- TANI: On it.

493
00:21:24,498 --> 00:21:26,332
We'll send you an update ASAP

494
00:21:26,357 --> 00:21:28,291
as long as you give
Eddie a belly rub from us.

495
00:21:28,316 --> 00:21:29,350
STEVE: Will do.

496
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,143
(phone beeps)

497
00:21:31,168 --> 00:21:33,391
(sighs) Hang in there, buddy.

498
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:42,815
Okay. All right, just relax, okay?

499
00:21:43,258 --> 00:21:45,284
Here's what we're gonna do.
I just need to get you stable.

500
00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:46,910
I'm gonna go up the road

501
00:21:46,935 --> 00:21:48,412
and I'm gonna flag
down a car, all right?

502
00:21:48,437 --> 00:21:49,437
We're gonna take a look.

503
00:21:49,556 --> 00:21:51,557
- Okay?
- Okay.

504
00:21:51,582 --> 00:21:53,083
Let me see.

505
00:21:53,151 --> 00:21:55,752
Okay, ow, ow, ow, ow,
ow. No, no, no, no, no.

506
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,855
I can't feel my l... I can't feel
my leg, can't feel my leg. Sorry.

507
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,524
It hurts everywhere. There's
something wrong with my back.

508
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:03,770
Okay, all right, so look,
just breathe, focus on me.

509
00:22:03,795 --> 00:22:06,196
Look at me. Everything's
gonna be okay, all right?

510
00:22:06,264 --> 00:22:07,464
I'm just gonna check you out

511
00:22:07,532 --> 00:22:08,774
and see where else you're hurt, okay?

512
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,617
Yeah, you do that.
You need to do that.

513
00:22:10,642 --> 00:22:13,250
All right. Lean forward a
little bit, just a little bit.

514
00:22:13,275 --> 00:22:15,105
- (groaning)
- Little bit, little bit.

515
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,864
- Okay, I see it.
- (whimpers)

516
00:22:18,485 --> 00:22:20,153
(heavy breathing)

517
00:22:20,178 --> 00:22:22,245
DANNY: Okay.

518
00:22:22,356 --> 00:22:23,456
All right.

519
00:22:23,856 --> 00:22:26,191
All right, stay like that.

520
00:22:28,899 --> 00:22:30,798
- What is that? What is that?
- It's just a little cut.

521
00:22:30,822 --> 00:22:32,656
What was that? What is it? Is it bad?

522
00:22:32,681 --> 00:22:34,849
- It's bad.
- No. It's just a little cut.

523
00:22:34,874 --> 00:22:37,275
- Just, look it, look it,
- I got to get it cleaned up,

524
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,297
and then we'll be okay, all right?

525
00:22:40,774 --> 00:22:42,008
Just tell me.

526
00:22:42,033 --> 00:22:45,535
Just don't lie to me,
please. Don't lie to me now.

527
00:22:49,724 --> 00:22:51,325
It's not good.

528
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,985
Okay? It's a little bad,

529
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:55,022
but I'm gonna fix it, all
right? I'm gonna get you stable,

530
00:22:55,046 --> 00:22:56,223
and everything's gonna be okay.

531
00:22:56,247 --> 00:22:58,615
You are gonna make it
through this. You understand?

532
00:22:58,683 --> 00:23:00,484
(quietly): Yeah.

533
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,164
_

534
00:23:06,189 --> 00:23:07,601
O'DONNELL: You're
looking for personnel

535
00:23:07,626 --> 00:23:09,539
information on
the dog's old unit?

536
00:23:09,564 --> 00:23:10,937
- Yes, sir.
- Eddie, is it?

537
00:23:10,962 --> 00:23:13,167
TANI: Correct. Um,
specifically,

538
00:23:13,211 --> 00:23:14,961
we would be grateful to
speak with any of the Marines

539
00:23:14,986 --> 00:23:16,804
that were on duty the day that
Eddie's handler was killed.

540
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:20,054
I understand. Uh, Corporal Bollinger

541
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:22,429
was killed in Farah Province

542
00:23:22,454 --> 00:23:24,889
on July 9, 2013.

543
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:28,969
Of the unit on patrol,
two men died that day.

544
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:31,265
Another two are on active missions

545
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:34,156
in classified locations,
thus unreachable.

546
00:23:34,649 --> 00:23:35,959
But it looks as though two Marines

547
00:23:35,983 --> 00:23:39,252
- might be available to make contact.
- That's great.

548
00:23:39,277 --> 00:23:42,045
One has left the service.

549
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,834
He's now a firefighter in Portland.

550
00:23:44,901 --> 00:23:47,709
Uh, Maine, not Oregon.

551
00:23:47,734 --> 00:23:52,365
And the other, he was
the unit's radio operator.

552
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:56,012
He's currently stationed at
Marine Wing Liaison Kadena

553
00:23:56,037 --> 00:23:58,038
at Kadena Air Base in Okinawa.

554
00:23:58,828 --> 00:24:01,007
Great. Thank you so much, Colonel.

555
00:24:01,118 --> 00:24:03,486
- Happy to help.
- Thank you.

556
00:24:03,511 --> 00:24:05,312
I hope the warrior's better soon.

557
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:09,047
- Thank you, sir.
- Absolutely.

558
00:24:10,051 --> 00:24:11,751
(grunting)

559
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:15,531
LESLIE: Anything?

560
00:24:15,556 --> 00:24:17,891
I'm looking.

561
00:24:18,562 --> 00:24:20,834
I thought you said
this place grows on you.

562
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:23,633
It does. Do me a favor and don't talk.

563
00:24:23,665 --> 00:24:25,437
You got to save your energy, okay?

564
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,882
- There's so much blood.
- I know.

565
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,218
I'll take care of that right now, okay?

566
00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:38,011
Okay. Lean forward

567
00:24:38,036 --> 00:24:39,970
- for me. Breathe.
- Mm-hmm.

568
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:44,834
- (groans)
- All right.

569
00:24:47,888 --> 00:24:49,632
Lean back,

570
00:24:51,062 --> 00:24:52,926
and good pressure on that, okay?

571
00:24:53,087 --> 00:24:55,414
All right, we're gonna
take care of this now.

572
00:24:58,966 --> 00:25:00,077
This is probably gonna hurt,

573
00:25:00,101 --> 00:25:01,781
but I got to stop this
bleeding, all right?

574
00:25:06,162 --> 00:25:08,096
- Okay, I got it.
- (whimpering)

575
00:25:11,405 --> 00:25:13,807
Come on, come on, you're tough.

576
00:25:13,957 --> 00:25:15,591
You're tough. Look at me.

577
00:25:15,616 --> 00:25:17,550
Look at me. Stay with me, okay?

578
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:20,830
I'm scared.

579
00:25:20,898 --> 00:25:23,023
I know you're scared,
but you don't have to be.

580
00:25:23,048 --> 00:25:24,406
You're gonna be okay.
I'm right here, all right?

581
00:25:24,431 --> 00:25:25,983
I don't pray.

582
00:25:26,703 --> 00:25:28,237
- You don't have to pray.
- I should pray.

583
00:25:28,262 --> 00:25:30,697
No, you don't have to pray
'cause I'm right here, okay?

584
00:25:31,476 --> 00:25:34,186
All you got to do is hang
tough. All right? Look at me,

585
00:25:34,211 --> 00:25:35,888
we're gonna get out of this
thing. I'm gonna go up there,

586
00:25:35,913 --> 00:25:38,279
I'm gonna flag down a
car, we're gonna go home.

587
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:41,241
Okay? Promise. I promise.

588
00:25:41,266 --> 00:25:43,101
Don't get upset, okay?

589
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:46,859
You know, since we're being
honest with each other, I, um,

590
00:25:47,324 --> 00:25:49,750
something I didn't tell
you that I think I should.

591
00:25:50,618 --> 00:25:51,818
You know, you said your aunt

592
00:25:51,886 --> 00:25:53,653
used to take you to, uh, to Romeo's.

593
00:25:53,764 --> 00:25:56,499
I know Romeo's very
well. I actually got into

594
00:25:56,524 --> 00:25:58,391
a-a fight in front of
Romeo's when I was in,

595
00:25:58,502 --> 00:26:00,169
when I was in school when I was a kid.

596
00:26:00,194 --> 00:26:01,561
You serious right now?

597
00:26:01,629 --> 00:26:03,449
Yeah. Seventh grade. Seventh grade,

598
00:26:03,474 --> 00:26:05,875
there was these two
big high school jerks

599
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,011
that were messing with my
friend, calling him fat 'cause...

600
00:26:08,036 --> 00:26:09,603
I don't know, calling him butterball.

601
00:26:09,712 --> 00:26:10,846
Well, was he fat?

602
00:26:11,101 --> 00:26:12,481
Yeah, he was very fat.

603
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:14,550
You know, he was, he was a big kid.

604
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:16,455
He used to pop zeppolis
like they were Tic Tacs.

605
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:18,912
Anyway, it doesn't justify
the ridicule, you know?

606
00:26:18,937 --> 00:26:20,453
I agree with that.

607
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:23,059
What happened?

608
00:26:23,844 --> 00:26:27,105
Why, I, uh, I, uh...
They were in high school.

609
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:28,964
They were big high
school basketball players.

610
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,859
They beat me up pretty good.
I got my ass kicked, you know.

611
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:36,164
- You're a good guy.
- Thanks.

612
00:26:40,917 --> 00:26:42,836
QUINN: Just got a text from
the radio op, he should be ready

613
00:26:42,903 --> 00:26:44,214
to Skype McGarrett in a few minutes.

614
00:26:44,238 --> 00:26:46,306
Cool.

615
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:49,018
- Eddie okay?
- He's restless.

616
00:26:49,043 --> 00:26:53,712
He's restless. McGarrett's
trying to settle him for a nap.

617
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,745
He did lap up some of
the water from the bowl

618
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:57,203
that I brought, though, so...

619
00:26:57,228 --> 00:26:59,896
Oh, that's weird. Did you tell
him the water was for Eddie?

620
00:27:01,273 --> 00:27:02,745
(chuckles)

621
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,815
You want to talk about it?

622
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,495
I don't know. I...
Okay, fine. Yeah. Um...

623
00:27:08,824 --> 00:27:11,878
So I go upstairs, and
I'm-I'm thinking about Eddie,

624
00:27:11,903 --> 00:27:13,548
and I'm-I'm worried about
him. I'm thinking about

625
00:27:13,573 --> 00:27:15,057
all the terrible things
that have happened to him.

626
00:27:15,082 --> 00:27:16,326
I'm thinking about the trauma that

627
00:27:16,351 --> 00:27:18,352
almost got him killed today.

628
00:27:18,838 --> 00:27:21,272
And then I-I walked by Junior's room...

629
00:27:22,704 --> 00:27:24,721
Junior's not invincible either.

630
00:27:24,746 --> 00:27:26,480
And now he's off on

631
00:27:26,505 --> 00:27:28,540
his secret SEAL mission, and I haven't

632
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:30,633
heard from him since
the morning that he left.

633
00:27:30,658 --> 00:27:33,720
But, like, I'm-I'm-I'm
trying not to think about it.

634
00:27:33,745 --> 00:27:37,409
Um... Just... being in this house is...

635
00:27:38,314 --> 00:27:39,784
doesn't make it easier.

636
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:44,323
You're right. Junior's not invincible,

637
00:27:44,861 --> 00:27:47,432
but... he is tough as hell.

638
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,292
And I know that he will do everything

639
00:27:49,317 --> 00:27:50,815
that he can to get back home safe,

640
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,112
back to the people that he loves.

641
00:27:53,284 --> 00:27:54,823
Yeah.

642
00:28:02,407 --> 00:28:04,682
- Hey. You okay?
- Hi. Yeah.

643
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,876
I think he, uh, he's
finally sleeping, so...

644
00:28:07,901 --> 00:28:09,969
- (laptop chimes)
- Okay, this is him.

645
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:12,956
Okay, his name is
Sergeant Victor Michaels.

646
00:28:12,981 --> 00:28:14,782
- I brought him up to speed.
- Copy that.

647
00:28:15,503 --> 00:28:18,182
- Sergeant Michaels, can you hear me?
- Loud and clear, Commander.

648
00:28:18,207 --> 00:28:20,084
Thank you very much for your
time today. I appreciate it.

649
00:28:20,109 --> 00:28:21,760
Hey, I always got time for Eddie.

650
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:24,939
- Sorry to hear what he's going through.
- Yeah, appreciate that.

651
00:28:24,964 --> 00:28:27,365
We spoke with his doctor,
and the doctor said if we can

652
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,167
figure out what the-the
trigger is for him,

653
00:28:29,192 --> 00:28:32,620
then maybe we can prevent this
from happening in the future.

654
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,737
We're pretty sure it's connected
to the death of his handler,

655
00:28:35,762 --> 00:28:38,565
so... and I'm very sorry to ask this

656
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:41,058
'cause I know how hard it
is... But anything you could

657
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:45,400
tell us about that day, uh,
it'd be really helpful.

658
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:48,971
Of course.

659
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:51,100
That's not the kind of day you forget.

660
00:28:52,796 --> 00:28:54,563
<i>As soon as we got out of the Humvees,</i>

661
00:28:54,588 --> 00:28:57,823
<i>I had that... that eerie feeling.</i>

662
00:28:57,848 --> 00:28:59,548
<i>You know the one,</i>

663
00:29:00,019 --> 00:29:01,920
<i>like there was death in the air.</i>

664
00:29:02,332 --> 00:29:04,885
<i>The area was littered with IEDs.
It felt like the whole place</i>

665
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,557
<i>- could blow at any second.</i>
- (Eddie barking)

666
00:29:06,582 --> 00:29:09,518
<i>Eddie, he had about the
best nose in the Corps.</i>

667
00:29:10,581 --> 00:29:12,784
<i>That area was a straight-up death trap.</i>

668
00:29:12,809 --> 00:29:14,596
<i>All it took is for one boot to take</i>

669
00:29:14,621 --> 00:29:15,760
<i>one step out of formation, and... </i>

670
00:29:15,785 --> 00:29:17,885
- (screams)
- (Eddie whines)

671
00:29:18,281 --> 00:29:19,481
<i>Suddenly I was on my back.</i>

672
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,392
<i>I remember the first thing I saw</i>

673
00:29:21,417 --> 00:29:23,260
<i>were purple flowers,</i>

674
00:29:23,285 --> 00:29:25,674
<i>covered in blood that
I thought was mine.</i>

675
00:29:26,899 --> 00:29:28,332
<i>And that's when I spotted Eddie.</i>

676
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,028
<i>He looked injured, but then he got up.</i>

677
00:29:32,065 --> 00:29:33,807
<i>He had to find his handler.</i>

678
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:36,210
<i>Those two had a special bond.</i>

679
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:42,597
(whining)

680
00:29:49,255 --> 00:29:50,956
Bollinger was a good man.

681
00:29:51,548 --> 00:29:54,081
I'm sure he was. I'm sorry.

682
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:56,092
Thank you, Commander.

683
00:29:56,117 --> 00:29:58,690
- I'm not sure if any of that helps.
- I know, I...

684
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:00,037
I think it really does. Listen,

685
00:30:00,062 --> 00:30:01,503
those purple flowers you
mentioned, you remember

686
00:30:01,528 --> 00:30:02,728
what they were called?

687
00:30:02,753 --> 00:30:05,081
Oh, yeah, they grew all
over the place in, uh, Farah.

688
00:30:05,113 --> 00:30:06,487
It's that restharrow stuff.

689
00:30:06,553 --> 00:30:07,619
Restharrow.

690
00:30:08,424 --> 00:30:10,432
Well, thank you again, Sergeant.

691
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,065
Of course. And look, you
take care of that dog, sir.

692
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:15,524
Lord knows he took care of us.

693
00:30:15,948 --> 00:30:17,049
I will.

694
00:30:25,345 --> 00:30:26,445
See what I'm seeing?

695
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,870
If you're talking
about the look of a man

696
00:30:27,895 --> 00:30:30,463
who's about to crack the code,
then that's an affirmative.

697
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:36,588
All right, all right.

698
00:30:37,528 --> 00:30:40,063
Hey. I need you to lean forward.

699
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,042
I'm gonna change these dressings, okay?

700
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,960
(groaning)

701
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:53,331
- Can I ask you something?
- Of course.

702
00:30:53,891 --> 00:30:55,859
Why were you in that bar?

703
00:30:56,987 --> 00:30:59,221
That's really what you want
to talk about right now?

704
00:30:59,246 --> 00:31:01,547
If I can't be rescued,
I shall be entertained.

705
00:31:01,691 --> 00:31:03,925
You are going to be rescued, okay?

706
00:31:04,165 --> 00:31:06,174
I was in that bar

707
00:31:07,706 --> 00:31:11,081
because I was in a mood
because of my ex-wife.

708
00:31:11,106 --> 00:31:12,907
Yeah, yeah, that'll do it.

709
00:31:12,989 --> 00:31:14,620
(groans)

710
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:19,844
How long you been split up?

711
00:31:19,869 --> 00:31:22,901
If I, uh, if I try to
tell you that whole story,

712
00:31:22,926 --> 00:31:24,694
we'll both be dead before I finish.

713
00:31:25,074 --> 00:31:28,370
We were sort of trying to work
it out the last year or so.

714
00:31:28,395 --> 00:31:30,432
- Didn't take?
- No, no.

715
00:31:30,457 --> 00:31:33,238
- We're better off as friends.
- Yeah. I've been there.

716
00:31:33,379 --> 00:31:35,829
Yeah? You got some
stories of your own?

717
00:31:35,854 --> 00:31:37,555
- Mm-hmm.
- Really?

718
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:40,239
- A lady never tells.
- Ah.

719
00:31:42,425 --> 00:31:44,793
- (car approaching)
- It's a car.

720
00:31:44,818 --> 00:31:46,596
- No, no, no, no. You can't leave me,
- Hey, look at me,

721
00:31:46,621 --> 00:31:48,565
- look at me, look at me. You're fine.
- you can't leave me. You can't leave me

722
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,867
- you can't go.
- I'll stop the car, we get an ambulance,

723
00:31:49,892 --> 00:31:51,378
and then we go home, okay?
That's all, that's all.

724
00:31:51,403 --> 00:31:52,866
Please don't go.

725
00:31:59,283 --> 00:32:00,283
(groans)

726
00:32:06,363 --> 00:32:08,026
Hey!

727
00:32:08,788 --> 00:32:11,056
Stop! Hey, hey!

728
00:32:11,788 --> 00:32:13,255
Hey!

729
00:32:13,323 --> 00:32:14,823
Hey!

730
00:32:25,102 --> 00:32:26,402
(cries out)

731
00:32:26,427 --> 00:32:28,395
(groaning)

732
00:32:37,746 --> 00:32:39,614
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.

733
00:32:39,674 --> 00:32:40,908
Hey, wake up.

734
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,093
Wake up, wake up.

735
00:32:43,118 --> 00:32:44,685
There you go.

736
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,354
Hey, I missed the car. Okay?

737
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:49,224
- Okay. It's not your fault.
- Oh, thank you.

738
00:32:49,292 --> 00:32:51,159
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you always this unlucky?

739
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,638
I was in that bar, wasn't I? Come on.

740
00:32:53,663 --> 00:32:54,896
Mm.

741
00:32:54,921 --> 00:32:56,455
Let me check you out here.

742
00:32:57,876 --> 00:33:00,778
Let me see. All right, this is good.

743
00:33:00,803 --> 00:33:02,304
Let me see your back.

744
00:33:02,371 --> 00:33:04,973
Hey, you gotta stay awake for me. Okay?

745
00:33:05,041 --> 00:33:06,293
Stay awake.

746
00:33:08,311 --> 00:33:09,778
(groans)

747
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,527
- You're out of towels.
- It's all right.

748
00:33:15,051 --> 00:33:16,084
It's gonna be okay.

749
00:33:16,109 --> 00:33:18,582
Not of we don't stop the bleeding.

750
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:21,690
I got this. Gonna...

751
00:33:32,426 --> 00:33:33,702
(groaning)

752
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:35,980
All right, lean back. Lean back.

753
00:33:36,005 --> 00:33:37,105
Pressure.

754
00:33:37,173 --> 00:33:38,773
You gotta keep pressure on your back

755
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:40,918
and you're gonna be fine.
We're getting out of here. Okay?

756
00:33:41,254 --> 00:33:42,920
All right?

757
00:33:42,945 --> 00:33:46,481
Just breathe easy. Easy, okay?

758
00:34:03,132 --> 00:34:04,332
Excuse me.

759
00:34:04,693 --> 00:34:05,700
Hi.

760
00:34:06,052 --> 00:34:08,737
Hello. Can I help you?

761
00:34:08,804 --> 00:34:11,406
We sure hope so. I'm Tani Rey.
This is Quinn Liu.

762
00:34:11,474 --> 00:34:13,051
We work with your
neighbor, Steve McGarrett.

763
00:34:13,075 --> 00:34:15,200
- I hope we're not intruding.
- No, not at all.

764
00:34:15,225 --> 00:34:16,970
Steve mentioned
you're a botany professor.

765
00:34:16,995 --> 00:34:19,021
I am. We came from central Connecticut,

766
00:34:19,046 --> 00:34:20,223
so this is paradise.

767
00:34:20,248 --> 00:34:22,516
The biodiversity of
flora here is incredible.

768
00:34:22,541 --> 00:34:24,042
90% of plant life found in Hawaii

769
00:34:24,067 --> 00:34:26,302
can't be found anywhere
else in the world.

770
00:34:29,824 --> 00:34:31,758
Sorry. Uh, you obviously didn't come by

771
00:34:31,783 --> 00:34:34,560
- to hear me geek out about plants.
- Actually...

772
00:34:34,796 --> 00:34:37,536
Oahu's climate can support the
growth of just about anything,

773
00:34:37,561 --> 00:34:39,996
so I've planted rare species
from all over the world.

774
00:34:40,021 --> 00:34:41,787
For my students to study and enjoy.

775
00:34:41,812 --> 00:34:44,247
Someday for my son, too.

776
00:34:44,272 --> 00:34:46,636
This is the one you were asking
about. Spiny restharrow.

777
00:34:46,661 --> 00:34:48,575
<i>Known to Latin speakers
as ononis spinosa.</i>

778
00:34:48,643 --> 00:34:51,066
- It's quite lovely, isn't it?
- TANI: It is, yeah.

779
00:34:51,091 --> 00:34:52,335
So Eddie must have
gotten through the hedges

780
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:54,099
connecting the yards,
or through the gate.

781
00:34:54,115 --> 00:34:56,996
Either way, he was nosing around,
smelled them and got triggered.

782
00:34:57,021 --> 00:34:59,586
I don't understand. Are you
talking about Eddie, Steve's dog?

783
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:02,191
Is he all right? It wouldn't
be a problem if he ingested it.

784
00:35:02,216 --> 00:35:03,449
It's not poisonous.

785
00:35:03,474 --> 00:35:05,976
It-It's not that. Um, I'm
not sure if Steve told you,

786
00:35:06,001 --> 00:35:08,152
but Eddie was a military working dog.

787
00:35:08,177 --> 00:35:10,230
He served with the
Marines in Afghanistan.

788
00:35:10,255 --> 00:35:12,458
These plants are abundant there.

789
00:35:12,483 --> 00:35:14,717
And he suffered a combat
trauma in a field full of them.

790
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:17,931
A couple days ago, Eddie's
canine PTS was triggered.

791
00:35:17,956 --> 00:35:21,888
And my plants were the
trigger. Oh, I feel awful.

792
00:35:21,913 --> 00:35:24,630
Oh, please. How could you know?
None of us did.

793
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:26,794
Regardless, I will
remove these right away.

794
00:35:26,819 --> 00:35:28,310
I can call a few of my
students and have them

795
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:30,464
help me transfer them to the
greenhouse on campus.

796
00:35:30,489 --> 00:35:32,489
Thank you. We appreciate
your understanding.

797
00:35:32,514 --> 00:35:34,239
- Steve will, too.
- Yeah.

798
00:35:36,349 --> 00:35:38,183
Oh, come on.

799
00:35:38,225 --> 00:35:40,466
- Come on, wake up.
- Uh, wha-

800
00:35:40,491 --> 00:35:43,493
Wake up. You're okay.

801
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:47,443
All right? Just breathe. Just breathe.

802
00:35:47,468 --> 00:35:49,403
There you go. That's good.

803
00:35:49,428 --> 00:35:50,972
All right, look, you're stable right now

804
00:35:50,997 --> 00:35:52,308
- and you're strong.
- I don't feel strong.

805
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:53,633
All right? You're strong.

806
00:35:53,658 --> 00:35:55,388
All we gotta do is catch a break. Okay?

807
00:35:55,413 --> 00:35:57,708
That's it. That all
we gotta do, all right?

808
00:35:57,733 --> 00:35:59,669
- You cold?
- (shivering) I'm tired.

809
00:35:59,694 --> 00:36:02,028
- All right. You're all right.
- I'm tired. So cold.

810
00:36:02,053 --> 00:36:04,922
I know, I know. I know, I know.

811
00:36:05,143 --> 00:36:06,794
I know. I know.

812
00:36:06,819 --> 00:36:08,419
Hey, I know. Come on.

813
00:36:08,521 --> 00:36:10,122
Come on, won't you come on?

814
00:36:10,147 --> 00:36:11,681
Okay. Okay, good.

815
00:36:11,706 --> 00:36:13,273
- Can't stay awake.
- Okay.

816
00:36:13,394 --> 00:36:15,802
Can't stay awake. No...

817
00:36:16,537 --> 00:36:17,604
All right.

818
00:36:17,629 --> 00:36:19,630
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

819
00:36:19,834 --> 00:36:21,702
Come o...

820
00:36:21,972 --> 00:36:23,907
(shouting): Come on!

821
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,833
Somebody!

822
00:36:32,936 --> 00:36:34,638
- Come on!
- (honks horn)

823
00:36:34,663 --> 00:36:36,564
Come on!

824
00:36:38,795 --> 00:36:41,764
- Wake up! Come on!
- (honking horn repeatedly)

825
00:36:41,789 --> 00:36:44,190
Come on!

826
00:36:47,935 --> 00:36:50,570
(truck horn honking in distance)

827
00:36:51,185 --> 00:36:52,860
Hey.

828
00:36:52,885 --> 00:36:55,087
- You hear that?
- Don't miss this one.

829
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:04,993
(tires screech)

830
00:37:05,025 --> 00:37:07,126
(air brakes hiss)

831
00:37:09,044 --> 00:37:11,345
Hey, I'm a cop. I need to use your radio

832
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:12,537
to call an ambulance.

833
00:37:12,562 --> 00:37:14,894
- Of course.
- (Danny groans)

834
00:37:14,919 --> 00:37:16,453
Channel nine.

835
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:19,218
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

836
00:37:19,243 --> 00:37:21,559
All right, this is
Detective Danny Williams

837
00:37:21,584 --> 00:37:22,637
with the Five-O Task Force.

838
00:37:22,662 --> 00:37:25,629
I need an ambulance,
uh, Waianae Valley Road,

839
00:37:25,654 --> 00:37:28,293
about a mile past Haleahi.

840
00:37:28,318 --> 00:37:32,551
Um, got life-threatening
injuries sustained by a female.

841
00:37:32,576 --> 00:37:34,699
She's lost a lot of blood. I
need an ambulance immediately.

842
00:37:34,942 --> 00:37:36,208
DISPATCH: Copy, Detective.

843
00:37:36,233 --> 00:37:38,801
Sending paramedic units to
your location right away.

844
00:37:38,826 --> 00:37:41,494
Right now, right now, please. Thanks.

845
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:48,301
Aw, look at you two. Love is real.

846
00:37:48,487 --> 00:37:50,824
Yeah, you know, uh, I think
rom-coms want us to believe

847
00:37:50,849 --> 00:37:52,934
that a race to the airport tops the list

848
00:37:52,959 --> 00:37:53,996
of romantic gestures,

849
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:57,285
but I believe that dodging
traffic has that beat.

850
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,547
Not to mention I always thought
chasing somebody to the airport

851
00:37:59,572 --> 00:38:01,292
was a little psycho.

852
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:04,709
You know, it's strange,
out there this morning

853
00:38:04,734 --> 00:38:05,667
in the traffic,

854
00:38:05,692 --> 00:38:06,969
where Eddie made eye contact with me,

855
00:38:06,994 --> 00:38:10,097
and I could see his panic and his fear,

856
00:38:10,292 --> 00:38:12,026
not knowing which way to turn.

857
00:38:12,051 --> 00:38:13,618
And I swear to God, I could relate.

858
00:38:15,094 --> 00:38:17,651
And after everything
that's happened this year...

859
00:38:19,134 --> 00:38:21,035
that's exactly where I would be

860
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,035
if I didn't have this
dog to lean on every day.

861
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,627
If I didn't have all of you.

862
00:38:25,182 --> 00:38:26,550
Not going anywhere, Steve.

863
00:38:26,577 --> 00:38:28,209
Yeah, ditto.

864
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:30,590
And I don't think young Edward here

865
00:38:30,615 --> 00:38:32,215
is gonna be moving
for the next 18 hours.

866
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,520
So I hope you're comfortable.

867
00:38:36,052 --> 00:38:37,586
By the way, um,

868
00:38:37,802 --> 00:38:39,469
how's Danny doing?

869
00:38:39,494 --> 00:38:41,293
I heard he was taking a few days.

870
00:38:41,872 --> 00:38:43,832
I spoke to him this morning. He's good.

871
00:38:44,301 --> 00:38:46,723
- Yeah.
- (knock on door)

872
00:38:46,754 --> 00:38:50,560
- Oh, maybe that's him now.
- Not unless he forgot his key.

873
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:04,441
Adam.

874
00:39:04,466 --> 00:39:05,633
Hey.

875
00:39:06,071 --> 00:39:07,809
It's been a minute.

876
00:39:09,095 --> 00:39:10,933
ADAM: Yeah, I, uh...

877
00:39:11,693 --> 00:39:13,574
I'm sorry I was gone so long.

878
00:39:14,729 --> 00:39:16,543
I just, um...

879
00:39:17,906 --> 00:39:19,699
I just had to get away.

880
00:39:21,788 --> 00:39:23,348
Clear my head.

881
00:39:26,615 --> 00:39:28,168
I get it.

882
00:39:28,691 --> 00:39:30,525
Welcome home, bro.

883
00:39:37,912 --> 00:39:40,613
(groaning)

884
00:39:40,638 --> 00:39:43,273
(grunts)

885
00:39:45,069 --> 00:39:48,004
(Danny grunting, panting)

886
00:39:48,066 --> 00:39:49,629
Hey, hey...

887
00:39:49,654 --> 00:39:52,923
Hey. Hey. Good news.
Ambulance is on the way.

888
00:39:53,169 --> 00:39:55,070
Huh?

889
00:39:55,095 --> 00:39:56,796
Okay? So you gotta stay awake.

890
00:39:56,821 --> 00:39:58,188
All right?

891
00:39:58,213 --> 00:40:01,849
Okay. Okay, there you go. (chuckles)

892
00:40:01,874 --> 00:40:04,051
- What's so funny?
- What's so funny?

893
00:40:04,076 --> 00:40:05,516
I got, I got the luck, like you said.

894
00:40:05,541 --> 00:40:07,901
I meet the girl of my dreams,
and I get into a car accident.

895
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:11,040
Ah, you're okay.

896
00:40:11,872 --> 00:40:13,371
Things are gonna work out for you.

897
00:40:13,396 --> 00:40:15,764
Yeah. Yeah.

898
00:40:16,921 --> 00:40:18,722
Stay awake.

899
00:40:19,028 --> 00:40:21,112
Hey, you never told me your name.

900
00:40:21,137 --> 00:40:23,141
My name? My name is Danny.

901
00:40:24,127 --> 00:40:26,574
My name's Danny. You gonna
tell me your name now?

902
00:40:29,165 --> 00:40:30,558
Huh?

903
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:36,285
Huh?

904
00:40:37,362 --> 00:40:39,277
No, no. Hey, hey.

905
00:40:43,621 --> 00:40:45,354
Wake up. Wake...

906
00:40:45,585 --> 00:40:46,685
Wake up.

907
00:41:04,843 --> 00:41:06,777
(exhales sharply)

908
00:41:31,768 --> 00:41:34,277
(sighs)

909
00:41:55,499 --> 00:41:57,500
(sirens approaching)

910
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,454
(sirens wailing)

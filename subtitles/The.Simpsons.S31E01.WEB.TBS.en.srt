00:00:07,782 --> 00:00:09,815
D'oh!

3
00:00:11,686 --> 00:00:13,552
Fold down that...

4
00:00:13,588 --> 00:00:14,687
and then up that...

5
00:00:14,722 --> 00:00:15,821
and this and over there

6
00:00:15,857 --> 00:00:17,723
and you have a beautiful swan!

7
00:00:17,759 --> 00:00:18,724
What the...?!

8
00:00:26,207 --> 00:00:30,183
This is Anger Watkins, and
you're watching basic cable's

9
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,978
angriest sports show.

10
00:00:32,111 --> 00:00:34,247
Folks, this is difficult to say,

11
00:00:34,282 --> 00:00:36,415
but, today, I'm angry!

12
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:37,849
I like how angry he is.

13
00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:39,418
I want to broach a topic

14
00:00:39,454 --> 00:00:43,356
that no one else has the
airtime to fill to discuss.

15
00:00:43,391 --> 00:00:45,224
Greatest of All Time.

16
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,226
LeBron, Kobe or MJ?

17
00:00:47,262 --> 00:00:49,888
I'll tell you why you're all wrong!

18
00:00:49,927 --> 00:00:51,364
Let's open the lines.

19
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:53,165
The producer says I'm gonna go on.

20
00:00:53,201 --> 00:00:54,500
Please, Sports Jesus,

21
00:00:54,536 --> 00:00:56,335
guide my blather.

22
00:00:56,371 --> 00:00:57,603
Welcome to Rage Nation.

23
00:00:57,639 --> 00:00:59,372
What the hell is your problem?

24
00:00:59,407 --> 00:01:02,169
Uh, first-time listener,

25
00:01:02,216 --> 00:01:03,724
long-time caller.

26
00:01:03,794 --> 00:01:05,144
So, I, uh...

27
00:01:05,179 --> 00:01:06,245
Give me a take!

28
00:01:06,281 --> 00:01:07,346
Anger needs a take.

29
00:01:07,382 --> 00:01:09,315
Who is number one?

30
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,117
Uh, John Stockton!

31
00:01:11,152 --> 00:01:12,285
John Stockton?!

32
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,353
We're trying to have
our daily conversation

33
00:01:14,389 --> 00:01:17,590
in which we rank
and re-rank three demigods,

34
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:22,128
and you bring John "Never Won
a Title" Stockton into the mix?!

35
00:01:22,163 --> 00:01:25,398
Shame! For shame!

36
00:01:29,304 --> 00:01:32,271
Homer, you got flushed.

37
00:01:32,307 --> 00:01:33,606
A man who don't know sports,

38
00:01:33,641 --> 00:01:36,098
um, he ain't much of a man.

39
00:01:36,123 --> 00:01:39,579
You're nothing to me now.
Just a husband and father.

40
00:01:39,614 --> 00:01:41,542
Stupid Anger Watkins

41
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:43,249
flushing me with an audio effect.

42
00:01:43,284 --> 00:01:46,252
Why not eat your feelings
with a cheer-up kebab?

43
00:01:46,287 --> 00:01:48,354
Let's see. Pizza slice,

44
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:50,389
summer sausage...

45
00:01:53,227 --> 00:01:54,360
Here you go.

46
00:01:54,395 --> 00:01:57,229
It was only a dumb call-in show.

47
00:01:57,265 --> 00:01:58,431
Easy for you to say.

48
00:01:58,466 --> 00:02:00,633
If that jerk
didn't like your sports notions,

49
00:02:00,668 --> 00:02:02,435
listen to someone else.

50
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:05,204
The Internet's full
of homemade sports shows.

51
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:07,106
Anyone could put one on,

52
00:02:07,141 --> 00:02:08,407
- I mean, even...
- Don't say "you."

53
00:02:08,443 --> 00:02:09,408
Don't say "you."

54
00:02:09,444 --> 00:02:10,443
Even you.

55
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:11,577
Damn it.

56
00:02:11,613 --> 00:02:13,792
Oh, yes. Of course!

57
00:02:13,831 --> 00:02:16,158
An Internet sports talk show!

58
00:02:16,183 --> 00:02:17,383
But where could I find a host

59
00:02:17,418 --> 00:02:19,285
who thinks all my opinions are great?

60
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,221
Me.

61
00:02:22,256 --> 00:02:25,391
Marge, prepare a congratulations kebab.

62
00:02:35,203 --> 00:02:37,436
These are hard as rocks.

63
00:02:37,472 --> 00:02:39,305
Food fight!

64
00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:46,245
Uh, this calls for massive retaliation.

65
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,381
Use your quadratic equations, men.

66
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:03,496
Oh, my God. I'm having a flashback.

67
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,234
Good Lord, I'm reliving
the Tot Offensive.

68
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:10,369
Skinner...

69
00:03:10,405 --> 00:03:12,238
I'll Heimlich you, sir.

70
00:03:12,273 --> 00:03:14,407
Just be still so I can embrace
you from behind.

71
00:03:16,344 --> 00:03:18,377
Get... off... me.

72
00:03:19,614 --> 00:03:22,381
Shh, you're safe now.

73
00:03:27,255 --> 00:03:31,357
Now, which of you little
hoodlums tossed the first tot?

74
00:03:31,392 --> 00:03:33,125
- The nerd did it.
- Principal Skinner,

75
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:34,460
it wasn't me. It was physics.

76
00:03:34,495 --> 00:03:36,395
Is this true, Fizix?

77
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:39,398
I would've thought better of a
Turkemenistani exchange student.

78
00:03:39,434 --> 00:03:41,500
Ah! I had nothing to do with it.

79
00:03:41,536 --> 00:03:45,271
I came to this country
to escape food-based violence.

80
00:03:45,306 --> 00:03:48,174
Lisa, one week's detention.

81
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,666
Welcome to Walkoff Homer!

82
00:04:11,701 --> 00:04:13,367
This is Homer Simpson,

83
00:04:13,403 --> 00:04:15,369
the rudest dude on the InnerTube.

84
00:04:15,405 --> 00:04:18,106
They say Muhammad Ali
was the greatest of all time,

85
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:20,708
but he never fought Cassius Clay.

86
00:04:20,743 --> 00:04:22,643
What was he afraid of?

87
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,545
Boom! Hot take.

88
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,414
And how come, in basketball,

89
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:28,416
they use the basket all the time

90
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:31,552
but you could literally play
football without any feet?

91
00:04:31,587 --> 00:04:32,687
This show sucks.

92
00:04:32,722 --> 00:04:36,424
I can't believe he's wasting
Flanders' Wi-Fi on this.

93
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:37,658
Here's a few things that bug me.

94
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,394
How can they call traveling
on a home team?

95
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,161
Why is soccer so stupid?

96
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:44,229
How can they play hockey in a garden?

97
00:04:44,254 --> 00:04:46,500
Why can't golfers carry their own clubs?

98
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,735
Lazy jerks.

99
00:04:51,441 --> 00:04:52,573
"Moose Poo"?!

100
00:04:52,608 --> 00:04:54,508
Why, you hilarious...

101
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,686
Eat Sunset Rose!

102
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,621
Semi-gloss.

103
00:05:20,503 --> 00:05:22,370
Seed bell?

104
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,672
Like that's gonna stop me.

105
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,642
Huh?

106
00:05:28,678 --> 00:05:30,411
Oh, so cute!

107
00:05:30,446 --> 00:05:32,413
Look at...

108
00:05:32,448 --> 00:05:34,448
Oh, my face! My face!

109
00:05:50,633 --> 00:05:52,733
What the hell's so funny?

110
00:06:00,977 --> 00:06:02,410
We must come together...

111
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,311
to lower our carbon...

112
00:06:04,347 --> 00:06:06,480
- Stupid boy.
- Dumb dad.

113
00:06:06,516 --> 00:06:07,615
First, he ruins my life.

114
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,316
- Then he ruins my livestream.
- Me ruining his show was

115
00:06:09,352 --> 00:06:11,283
- the only good part of his show.
- I'm gonna change the NHL with my idea

116
00:06:11,308 --> 00:06:12,586
Fat goalie was his only good take.

117
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,655
- for morbidly obese goalies.
- Should've led with it.

118
00:06:15,725 --> 00:06:18,359
Hello. #FirstImpression.

119
00:06:18,394 --> 00:06:19,527
Oh, my God, a hipster!

120
00:06:19,562 --> 00:06:21,017
Marge, bring him a microbrew!

121
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,530
- Quick!
- I'm on it!

122
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:27,111
Ah...

123
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:30,438
The alluvial hops really bring
out the riparian bitterness.

124
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,572
He likes it.

125
00:06:31,607 --> 00:06:33,541
- I think.
- I did like it.

126
00:06:33,576 --> 00:06:35,443
My name's Warburton Parker.

127
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,578
I'm a stranger to you.
Why should you listen to me?

128
00:06:37,613 --> 00:06:39,346
- You don't know my backstory.
- Mm-hmm.

129
00:06:39,382 --> 00:06:40,714
Well, here it is... colon...

130
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,717
as a child,
my only friend was my computer.

131
00:06:43,753 --> 00:06:45,419
I was teased every day.

132
00:06:45,455 --> 00:06:46,587
Then I became a pro snowboarder,

133
00:06:46,622 --> 00:06:48,622
married a supermodel, went into tech,

134
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,524
made a fortune, bought the factories

135
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,693
where the kids who teased me's
parents worked

136
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:54,462
and shut the factories down.

137
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,629
Do you have a backstory?

138
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,731
Once, when I was six, I ate a radio.

139
00:06:57,767 --> 00:06:59,533
I like you,

140
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:00,768
but that won't get in the way.

141
00:07:00,803 --> 00:07:02,470
Let me cut to the chase.

142
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,704
I make money from viral videos.

143
00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:06,507
And you two have gone viral.

144
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:10,277
"Raccoon in a revolving door" viral.

145
00:07:13,483 --> 00:07:15,683
You're right to dance in such a fashion.

146
00:07:15,718 --> 00:07:17,518
Because I'll show you how to make videos

147
00:07:17,553 --> 00:07:19,553
that will make you rich.

148
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:21,288
And me richer.

149
00:07:21,324 --> 00:07:22,523
And me richest.

150
00:07:22,558 --> 00:07:23,724
What are you doing here?

151
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,527
I get an alert
whenever anyone's getting rich.

152
00:07:31,037 --> 00:07:35,138
Wow. 5.million views!

153
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,251
Wow! Good, not great.

154
00:07:37,276 --> 00:07:39,110
That's the population of Colorado.

155
00:07:39,212 --> 00:07:40,311
Is that the Broncos one?

156
00:07:40,413 --> 00:07:42,246
- It is.
- Aw.

157
00:07:42,348 --> 00:07:45,282
The question is,
how much money have you made?

158
00:07:45,384 --> 00:07:47,284
Let's see. Uh, third quarter take...

159
00:07:47,386 --> 00:07:49,186
- Factor in overhead.
- Of course.

160
00:07:49,288 --> 00:07:50,354
- Overhead.
- Projections.

161
00:07:50,456 --> 00:07:51,422
Apples to apples.

162
00:07:51,524 --> 00:07:54,125
Figure net profit.

163
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,536
Got it. Nothing.

164
00:07:55,561 --> 00:07:57,704
The question was rhetorical, you idiots.

165
00:07:57,729 --> 00:07:59,196
Sorry about the "idiots" thing.

166
00:07:59,298 --> 00:08:03,100
But what you need to do is monetize.

167
00:08:03,202 --> 00:08:06,203
- Monetize! Monetize!
- Monetize! Monetize!

168
00:08:06,305 --> 00:08:08,155
Monorail. Monorail.

169
00:08:08,311 --> 00:08:10,107
Wait, what are we talking about?

170
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:12,343
Perhaps you are familiar

171
00:08:12,445 --> 00:08:14,445
with the greatest viral video
of all time,

172
00:08:14,547 --> 00:08:17,281
"Monkey smells finger
and falls out of tree."

173
00:08:17,383 --> 00:08:19,517
Hmm. No, I've never seen...

174
00:08:21,654 --> 00:08:23,554
Oh, my... Oh...

175
00:08:23,656 --> 00:08:25,289
Oh, that monkey!

176
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:35,399
And the-the monkey!

177
00:08:37,637 --> 00:08:39,403
He smelled his finger.

178
00:08:42,241 --> 00:08:43,340
Then boom!

179
00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:49,146
Smell.

180
00:08:49,248 --> 00:08:51,382
That monkey and that monkey's estate

181
00:08:51,484 --> 00:08:53,417
made zero dollars.

182
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,419
Even less in monkey dollars.

183
00:08:55,521 --> 00:08:57,188
If he had signed with me,

184
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,355
I mean, just hypothetically,

185
00:08:58,457 --> 00:09:00,324
there would be... oh, I don't know...

186
00:09:00,426 --> 00:09:02,059
Monkey Finger Sniff T-shirts,

187
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:03,460
Monkey Finger Sniff Finger Wipes,

188
00:09:03,563 --> 00:09:05,396
Monkey Finger Sniff sponsorships

189
00:09:05,498 --> 00:09:08,299
and a spot on Weekend Update on SNL.

190
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:10,401
Host, Rami Malek or better.

191
00:09:10,503 --> 00:09:12,303
Musical guest, Pitbull.

192
00:09:12,405 --> 00:09:15,834
What this monkey didn't sniff
was opportunity.

193
00:09:15,943 --> 00:09:18,098
In the next five minutes,
you'll get more views

194
00:09:18,123 --> 00:09:20,077
than the entire rebooted Murphy Brown.

195
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:21,345
Ugh, such high hopes.

196
00:09:21,447 --> 00:09:23,080
Not the same without Eldin.

197
00:09:23,182 --> 00:09:25,482
Now, this fight, you're
gonna get kickback from...

198
00:09:25,585 --> 00:09:28,185
- Duff Beer?
- Look at your shirt.

199
00:09:28,287 --> 00:09:30,154
Oh!

200
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,425
Label to camera.

201
00:09:34,527 --> 00:09:36,160
Hey, label to camera.

202
00:09:41,367 --> 00:09:43,234
They're gonna love this publicity.

203
00:09:43,336 --> 00:09:46,136
You guys just earned your first quarter.

204
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,271
First quarter revenue?

205
00:09:47,373 --> 00:09:49,988
No. First quarter, like the coin.

206
00:09:50,013 --> 00:09:51,993
Halt and Catch Fire, boy!

207
00:09:52,114 --> 00:09:53,146
Silicon Valley!

208
00:09:53,227 --> 00:09:55,088
How the Web Was Won.

209
00:09:55,135 --> 00:09:57,248
I'll give you another quarter
to shut up.

210
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,283
Monetize.

211
00:10:03,222 --> 00:10:04,521
Look at us,

212
00:10:04,624 --> 00:10:06,190
the bully,

213
00:10:06,292 --> 00:10:08,292
the princess, more bullies,

214
00:10:08,394 --> 00:10:12,162
the Ralph and me, the
smart kid no one gets.

215
00:10:12,265 --> 00:10:14,164
Yet, maybe, by the end of the day,

216
00:10:14,267 --> 00:10:16,400
I'll realize this is just what I needed.

217
00:10:16,502 --> 00:10:18,269
This is what I needed
to break through the...

218
00:10:18,371 --> 00:10:19,436
Lisa, you don't belong here.

219
00:10:19,538 --> 00:10:21,572
Oh, thank God. So long, delinquents!

220
00:10:21,674 --> 00:10:25,242
Your detention is being held in
our new facility, the R.O.C.C.

221
00:10:25,344 --> 00:10:28,612
Welcome to the Remote On-site
Correctional Center.

222
00:10:28,714 --> 00:10:31,448
How can something be both remote
and on-site?

223
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,317
All right, wisenheimer.

224
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:35,519
You just earned yourself
a day in the hole.

225
00:10:35,621 --> 00:10:38,289
The Holistic Obstinance
Lessening Environment.

226
00:10:40,326 --> 00:10:42,226
Uh-oh.

227
00:10:42,328 --> 00:10:44,461
There's nothing in here
but old Goosebumps books.

228
00:10:44,563 --> 00:10:46,230
Fine. Read those.

229
00:10:46,332 --> 00:10:49,466
They aren't scary. They aren't scary!

230
00:10:49,568 --> 00:10:51,502
What happened to regular detention?

231
00:10:51,604 --> 00:10:53,270
Well, because we could no longer afford

232
00:10:53,372 --> 00:10:54,715
any after-school activity,

233
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,174
the school district has
outsourced detention.

234
00:10:57,276 --> 00:10:59,343
Welcome to Misbehavior Solutions,

235
00:10:59,445 --> 00:11:01,412
a Torture 500 company.

236
00:11:01,514 --> 00:11:03,580
You privatized detention?

237
00:11:03,683 --> 00:11:06,283
Lisa, you have to understand.

238
00:11:06,385 --> 00:11:08,152
Anyone who's done anything remotely poor

239
00:11:08,254 --> 00:11:09,453
is in private prison.

240
00:11:09,555 --> 00:11:11,488
Oh, did I say "poor"? I meant wrong.

241
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,223
No more questions.

242
00:11:13,326 --> 00:11:15,326
So, how's the monetizing going?

243
00:11:15,428 --> 00:11:16,560
Pick a hand.

244
00:11:16,662 --> 00:11:18,262
Pick again.

245
00:11:18,364 --> 00:11:19,463
Not the same hand.

246
00:11:19,565 --> 00:11:21,298
I'm not a magician.
It's in the other hand.

247
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,566
Please pick the other hand.

248
00:11:22,668 --> 00:11:24,335
All right, I'm just gonna
show you the check.

249
00:11:24,437 --> 00:11:26,136
Oh, my God!

250
00:11:26,238 --> 00:11:28,305
$5,000!

251
00:11:28,407 --> 00:11:30,541
This will come in handy
when I buy a boat!

252
00:11:33,346 --> 00:11:35,579
Now, for the really big money,
I sold the location rights

253
00:11:35,681 --> 00:11:37,481
- to your next fight.
- Huh?

254
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:40,417
No, no, no. This needs
to be a discussion.

255
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:42,252
It's here in this
fried chicken restaurant.

256
00:11:42,355 --> 00:11:43,554
End of discussion.

257
00:11:43,656 --> 00:11:46,156
You see, this place
has an image problem.

258
00:11:46,258 --> 00:11:47,491
They've had nine salmonella deaths

259
00:11:47,593 --> 00:11:50,327
and one fried pinky in the past week.

260
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:51,628
Mmm...

261
00:11:51,731 --> 00:11:54,264
Salmon-ella.

262
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:56,467
So they want you two... you and you...

263
00:11:56,569 --> 00:11:58,335
to change the conversation.

264
00:11:58,437 --> 00:12:00,604
If there's a regional,
casual dining chain

265
00:12:00,706 --> 00:12:03,474
that needs my help, I'm there!

266
00:12:03,576 --> 00:12:06,410
My heroes.

267
00:12:06,512 --> 00:12:08,445
Okay, kind of, you know, fake nibble.

268
00:12:08,547 --> 00:12:10,414
- Pretend you're enjoying the thighs.
- I am.

269
00:12:10,516 --> 00:12:11,548
Uh, they're made of wax.

270
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:13,384
Whatever. I'm on my fourth bucket.

271
00:12:13,486 --> 00:12:15,486
Sad. Okay, just action.

272
00:12:16,655 --> 00:12:19,423
Why, you little...

273
00:12:21,394 --> 00:12:23,360
And escalate and escalate.

274
00:12:23,462 --> 00:12:25,329
Views, views, views.

275
00:12:25,431 --> 00:12:27,431
Yes!

276
00:12:27,533 --> 00:12:30,167
Feel the burn. Literally sit in it.

277
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:32,236
Would you like some onion rings?

278
00:12:32,338 --> 00:12:33,992
I don't see why not.

279
00:12:34,234 --> 00:12:37,608
Ah. Beautiful.

280
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:40,444
Look at those view numbers fly.

281
00:12:40,546 --> 00:12:42,212
I-I shouldn't say this.

282
00:12:42,314 --> 00:12:43,414
No, I-I'm gonna say it.

283
00:12:43,516 --> 00:12:45,215
Okay, I say it a lot.

284
00:12:45,317 --> 00:12:49,353
You two are more beloved
than Marathon-Diarrhea Guy.

285
00:12:49,455 --> 00:12:52,222
- I love that guy.
- Best guy.

286
00:12:52,324 --> 00:12:54,425
We have so many sick
sponsored fights lined up.

287
00:12:54,527 --> 00:12:56,527
We're gonna make
Marathon-Diarrhea Guy look

288
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:58,529
like Dog on Washing Machine.

289
00:12:58,631 --> 00:13:02,166
- I love that dog!
- Best dog.

290
00:13:04,503 --> 00:13:07,104
Violence is the best.

291
00:13:07,206 --> 00:13:09,339
Dad, you're holding my hand.

292
00:13:09,442 --> 00:13:11,108
Is that weird?

293
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,276
I've seen it in books.

294
00:13:12,378 --> 00:13:15,112
Say, boy, can I buy you a...?

295
00:13:15,214 --> 00:13:17,581
Nah, I'm good, but thanks.

296
00:13:17,683 --> 00:13:19,450
Give me a Duff, Moe.

297
00:13:19,552 --> 00:13:21,518
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Your money's no good here.

298
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,288
You're a celebrity now, Mr. YouTube.

299
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,290
The biggest one this bar has seen

300
00:13:26,392 --> 00:13:28,525
since the snake
that ate three pool balls.

301
00:13:28,627 --> 00:13:31,195
Got a picture of that. See it?

302
00:13:31,297 --> 00:13:32,463
Anything I can do for you.

303
00:13:32,565 --> 00:13:34,298
Anything. You just name it.

304
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,400
Well, little more
than I thought you'd ask for,

305
00:13:36,502 --> 00:13:38,368
but, uh, no, I respect the greed.

306
00:13:38,471 --> 00:13:40,370
Now I'm going back to my people.

307
00:13:40,473 --> 00:13:42,306
Hey, how you doing?

308
00:13:45,578 --> 00:13:49,179
It's that kid from YouTube!

309
00:13:49,281 --> 00:13:52,549
You, my friend, are getting an escort.

310
00:13:52,651 --> 00:13:56,420
Nah-nah, nah-nah, nah-nah.

311
00:13:56,522 --> 00:13:58,255
Aw, isn't that cute?

312
00:13:58,357 --> 00:14:01,291
Let's give the biggest one a gun
and take the week off.

313
00:14:03,496 --> 00:14:06,196
Milhouse, why are you in detention?

314
00:14:06,298 --> 00:14:08,432
For using the metric side of my ruler.

315
00:14:08,534 --> 00:14:11,201
That seems pretty arbitrary.

316
00:14:11,303 --> 00:14:13,270
Uh, why am I here?

317
00:14:13,372 --> 00:14:16,473
All I did was wear swim trunks
in the shower.

318
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,308
They're packing detention

319
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,543
with minor infractors.

320
00:14:19,645 --> 00:14:21,311
But why?

321
00:14:21,413 --> 00:14:23,380
Why do corporations do anything?

322
00:14:23,482 --> 00:14:25,249
To help society.

323
00:14:25,351 --> 00:14:27,317
We need you
to make kiddie license plates.

324
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:30,220
I need 100 Caitlyns, 100 Kaitlyns

325
00:14:30,322 --> 00:14:32,849
and a thousand Kate... Lynns.

326
00:14:32,874 --> 00:14:35,159
Oh, my mom's picking me up.

327
00:14:35,261 --> 00:14:36,426
She'll be frantic!

328
00:14:36,529 --> 00:14:38,529
Oh, they said
I could pick him up at midnight.

329
00:14:38,631 --> 00:14:40,164
Mm!

330
00:14:40,266 --> 00:14:41,565
You want something stamped?

331
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:43,367
How about this?

332
00:14:43,469 --> 00:14:45,402
Strike! Strike! Strike!

333
00:14:45,504 --> 00:14:47,538
Strike! Strike! Strike!

334
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,374
Strike! Strike! Strike!

335
00:14:50,476 --> 00:14:52,176
How do you know about unions?

336
00:14:52,278 --> 00:14:54,511
'Cause our history books end
in the 1930s.

337
00:14:55,681 --> 00:14:57,581
Thanks, guys.

338
00:14:57,683 --> 00:14:59,383
Hey, Dad!

339
00:14:59,485 --> 00:15:02,252
Hey, son! I kind of missed you.

340
00:15:02,354 --> 00:15:04,188
I kind of missed you, too.

341
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,455
Aw.

342
00:15:05,558 --> 00:15:07,257
Okay, they're hugging.

343
00:15:07,359 --> 00:15:09,259
Excuse me, but I thought
the hate was real.

344
00:15:09,361 --> 00:15:10,863
I have not been so angry

345
00:15:10,888 --> 00:15:13,230
since I saw every Star Wars
since the second.

346
00:15:13,332 --> 00:15:15,399
They are no longer my heroes!

347
00:15:15,501 --> 00:15:19,369
Kumiko, we are changing
the Comic-Con costumes.

348
00:15:19,471 --> 00:15:21,371
We're going back to our old costumes...

349
00:15:21,473 --> 00:15:23,273
Sailor Moon and the Moon.

350
00:15:28,382 --> 00:15:31,745
Hey there, Chalmers. Hey there, Skinner.

351
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:34,738
We will be here until dinner!

352
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,308
These Norma Rae-sinets
refuse to back down.

353
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,711
You can cut detention with a knife.

354
00:15:41,814 --> 00:15:43,747
In other news, the Pope has died.

355
00:15:43,849 --> 00:15:46,383
My corporation has a deal
with this school

356
00:15:46,452 --> 00:15:50,287
to provide free... kishly happy workers.

357
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:51,755
You better fix this and fast.

358
00:15:51,857 --> 00:15:53,590
I think I have an answer.

359
00:15:53,692 --> 00:15:56,626
I know people who will do
anything for money

360
00:15:56,728 --> 00:16:00,497
as long as it doesn't involve kids...

361
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:05,235
the teachers.

362
00:16:17,349 --> 00:16:18,348
Take it from the Moon.

363
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,550
Bart and Homer have cratered.

364
00:16:20,652 --> 00:16:23,353
I hate them and I... uh-oh.

365
00:16:23,455 --> 00:16:25,388
So, because people think
you like each other,

366
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:26,556
you're has-beens.

367
00:16:26,658 --> 00:16:27,691
Yesterday's views.

368
00:16:27,793 --> 00:16:29,526
Deader than MySpace.

369
00:16:29,628 --> 00:16:32,295
15 minutes of lame.

370
00:16:32,397 --> 00:16:35,432
Why are you still here around me?

371
00:16:35,534 --> 00:16:37,601
Please help us. It hurts so much to know

372
00:16:37,703 --> 00:16:40,403
that no one is clicking me or liking me.

373
00:16:40,506 --> 00:16:41,705
They might have no opinion.

374
00:16:41,807 --> 00:16:43,540
I can't live with that!

375
00:16:43,642 --> 00:16:46,643
May I make an original
and groundbreaking observation

376
00:16:46,745 --> 00:16:48,378
that no one has ever said before?

377
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,413
There is one thing
that show business loves.

378
00:16:50,516 --> 00:16:51,748
- Betty White?
- A comeback.

379
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,550
We are going to put you out in front

380
00:16:53,652 --> 00:16:55,318
of some of the greatest influencers

381
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,144
and tastemakers alive.

382
00:16:57,169 --> 00:16:59,456
We will remake Bart and Homer Brand.

383
00:16:59,558 --> 00:17:02,459
What do you say to BHB2?

384
00:17:02,484 --> 00:17:04,093
Is it a drug? Lay it on me.

385
00:17:04,132 --> 00:17:06,563
It stands for
"Bart Homer Brand 2," you moron.

386
00:17:06,665 --> 00:17:08,532
Of course it is.

387
00:17:08,634 --> 00:17:10,433
Is it a pill?

388
00:17:10,536 --> 00:17:12,369
Or the other end?

389
00:17:13,772 --> 00:17:16,573
This is the largest gathering
of social media influencers

390
00:17:16,675 --> 00:17:18,119
in the western hemisphere.

391
00:17:18,144 --> 00:17:19,342
There's Detonator,

392
00:17:19,444 --> 00:17:21,378
the Internet's leading
walkthrough gamer.

393
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,612
What's your side quest, Demon?

394
00:17:22,714 --> 00:17:24,548
- Uh, well, I...
- Terminate dialogue tree.

395
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,349
Return to main quest.

396
00:17:26,374 --> 00:17:28,173
Hmm.

397
00:17:28,472 --> 00:17:29,604
Hey, there's Leslie Sky.

398
00:17:29,706 --> 00:17:32,474
She does makeup tutorials
with veiled white nationalism.

399
00:17:32,576 --> 00:17:35,577
For the foundation,
we can either go with brown,

400
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,278
or skin color.

401
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,447
Oh, my God, it's Jurgen,

402
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:41,416
Southern Norway's leading unboxer.

403
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:44,452
First we take the burger box
from the bag, yeah.

404
00:17:44,554 --> 00:17:48,423
Carefully open the box
so it can be reclasped.

405
00:17:48,448 --> 00:17:49,501
Mm-hmm.

406
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:50,692
Robust hinging.

407
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,665
I am tired now.

408
00:17:57,767 --> 00:17:59,567
And winter comes.

409
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:06,207
And now, to tell you
what you're gonna do.

410
00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:08,610
Live Online.

411
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,578
Doesn't "mortal" mean "dead"?

412
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,249
Um, it can, but it's just
a figure of speech.

413
00:18:14,351 --> 00:18:16,217
So we don't kill each other?

414
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:18,286
Oh, if you did, that would be great.

415
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,388
But let's play it by ear. Okay, guys,

416
00:18:20,413 --> 00:18:21,533
when you're in combat,

417
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,258
definitely killing each other,

418
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,393
it's important to feature
your sponsored weapons.

419
00:18:25,495 --> 00:18:28,196
Bart, you're promoting Netflix.

420
00:18:28,298 --> 00:18:31,232
Got it? And Trident gum.

421
00:18:31,334 --> 00:18:34,168
Homer, you're repping Axe Body Spray

422
00:18:34,271 --> 00:18:36,471
and Trident Spearmint gum.

423
00:18:36,496 --> 00:18:37,649
Do you get it, Homer?

424
00:18:37,674 --> 00:18:39,474
The product things match the words.

425
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:41,442
I don't know, this seems kind of lame.

426
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:42,587
You know what's not lame?

427
00:18:42,612 --> 00:18:44,579
An audience of 200 livestreams

428
00:18:44,681 --> 00:18:46,414
while you kill your own father.

429
00:18:46,516 --> 00:18:48,349
Or whatever. Feel it out.

430
00:18:48,451 --> 00:18:51,252
I don't know, I'm gonna need
some more inspiration.

431
00:18:51,354 --> 00:18:54,589
Oh, my God, is it really you?

432
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,460
It is.

433
00:18:59,563 --> 00:19:02,430
Ladies and gentlemen,

434
00:19:02,532 --> 00:19:05,500
YouTubers, Instagrammers,

435
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:08,570
and homeless former Viners,

436
00:19:08,672 --> 00:19:11,606
you loved them in their
smackdown at Panda Express.

437
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:14,375
Then they hugged
and you were like, "What?"

438
00:19:14,477 --> 00:19:17,245
Homer and Bart Simpson!

439
00:19:17,347 --> 00:19:19,347
Do I smell fear?

440
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,215
I'm not afraid of you.

441
00:19:21,318 --> 00:19:25,253
You're smelling the refreshing
scent of Axe Body Spray.

442
00:19:25,355 --> 00:19:26,588
Dark Temptation.

443
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:40,301
I don't know, Dad.
This just doesn't feel right.

444
00:19:40,403 --> 00:19:41,603
I don't want to fight you.

445
00:19:41,705 --> 00:19:43,504
Me, neither, son.

446
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:50,645
Who'd have thought that two guys
from such different worlds

447
00:19:50,747 --> 00:19:52,547
could connect like us?

448
00:19:55,518 --> 00:19:57,518
Quit using your words!

449
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,490
Hello. I'm Homer Simpson.

450
00:20:23,592 --> 00:20:27,394
And this is episode
two of Walkoff Homer.

451
00:20:27,496 --> 00:20:28,595
Today's question:

452
00:20:28,697 --> 00:20:31,631
are sports talk shows a complete
and utter waste of time?

453
00:20:31,734 --> 00:20:33,500
We will get to the bottom of this

454
00:20:33,602 --> 00:20:35,502
within the next five hours.

455
00:20:35,604 --> 00:20:37,537
Five hours?!

456
00:20:37,639 --> 00:20:39,573
I can't get my point across
in five hours.

457
00:20:39,675 --> 00:20:42,442
My whole career depends on me never
quite getting to the finish.

458
00:20:42,544 --> 00:20:44,086
Because I know...

459

00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:22,821
Okay, not the
best first impression.

Let's skip ahead.

10
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:27,292

11
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:29,194
So as I was saying,
I'm Meg Murphy,

12
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,863

13
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:32,464
will be the
greatest summer ever.

14
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:34,066
Being me can be exhausting.

15
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:35,634
My life is a little...

16
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:36,835
Strange.

17
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:37,936
But it's not just me.

18
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:39,104

No, not you, Harold.

24

Yes, you do
have beautiful eyes.

25
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:47,646
- We may look normal,

26
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:49,615
but we're not like
other families exactly.

27
00:00:49,617 --> 00:00:50,616
- So how did you sleep?

28
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:51,950
- Great.

29
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:53,886
I was only woken up once
when a bat flew into my room

30
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:55,154
and got stuck
in my pillowcase.

31

32

Just go get that cereal up there
on the shelf, right?

40
00:01:12,373 --> 00:01:14,106
Just use the ladder

370
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:28,700
as hurricane Meg.

371
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:29,701
- [Sighs]

372
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:30,735
You know what?
I know.

373
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:32,203
I know what will
make you feel better.

374
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,371
Here.

375
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,206
Yes, I am paying you off
to be a happy daughter.

376
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,909
Seriously, you should just go
and buy yourself

377
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:39,577
a whole new summer wardrobe.

378
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:41,613
You deserve it.

379
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:43,281
- My suitcase got left behind?

380
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:44,949
- Yeah.

381
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:49,687
- ¶ It's a cruel ¶

382
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:52,624
¶ cruel summer ¶

383
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:56,394
¶ leaving me here
on my own ¶

384
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,429
¶ it's a cruel ¶

385
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:00,798
¶ cruel summer ¶

386
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,467
¶ now you're gone ¶

387
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:05,536
¶ you're not the only one ¶

388
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,412
[kids screaming distantly]

389
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,247
¶ The city is crowded ¶

390
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,483
¶ my friends are away ¶

391
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:26,858
- oh.
- Oh.

392
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:29,827
You.

393
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:31,162
- Ivy Murray.

394
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:34,599
Aka the meanest girl
in the history of mean girls,

395
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:37,068
aka the bane
of my existence,

396
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,704
aka--
oh, no.

397
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:41,172
- What are you doing here?

398
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:42,807
- Well, my grandpa lives here,
so--

399
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,509
- here?
In harvest hills?

400
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:46,344
But this is my town.

401
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:47,879
I come here every summer,

402
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:49,180
and you're not invited.

403
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:51,683
- Trust me. I am just as unhappy
about this as you are.

404
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:53,284
- My summer's ruined.

405
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,687
My life is ruined.

406
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:59,424
Give me that.

407
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:04,462
This town is supposed
to be a hurricane Meg-free zone.

408
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,564
- Of all the towns we could
have come to this summer,

409
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,166
it had to be here?

410
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:10,101
Harvest hills is horrible.

411
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:12,036
This is going to be
the worst summer ever.

412
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,174
- Hold on.

413
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:17,875
I found these
monkey socks first.

414
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:20,678
And finders keepers.

415
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,679
These must be yours.

416
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:22,914
- Yeah.

417
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,749
- I would definitely rock
those socks, though.

418
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:25,750
- Thanks.

419
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:26,851
I'm embarrassed.

420
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:28,653
- Well, hi, embarrassed.
I'm Brett.

421
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,221
- It's Meg, actually.

422
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:31,990
- Well, nice to meet you, Meg.

423
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:33,324
Are you from harvest hills?

424
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,625
I haven't seen you before.

425
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:37,195
- No, I'm just here
visiting my bees.

426
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:38,529
I mean, my grandpa.

427
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:39,764
Well, not visiting.

428
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:41,466
I guess I'm kind of living here
this summer.

429
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:42,633
My house, it, uh,

430
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:43,935
kind of fell down.

431
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:44,969
So many bees.

432
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:46,437
- Well, welcome.

433
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:48,606
You're actually just in time
for the harvest festival.

434
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:49,707
- I can see.

435
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:51,009
- There's tons of fun stuff
to do.

436
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,076
It lasts all week.

437
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:53,745
And every year
they pick one person

438
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:56,080
to lower the flag
at the closing ceremony.

439
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:57,548
Guess who they picked
this year.

440
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,250
- Who?

441
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:01,019
I have no idea.

442
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,220
Wait.

443
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:03,254
Is it you?

444
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:04,522
- Yes.
Jeez.

445
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:05,957
Took you long enough.

446
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:08,226
I'll have you know
it's a very big honor.

447
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:09,994
Get to shake hands
with the mayor.

448
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:11,763
Get a really snazzy t-shirt.

449
00:17:11,765 --> 00:17:13,898
- You know, we can never
have too many t-shirts.

450
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,899
- [Chortles]

451
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:17,268
- Smooth, Meg.

452
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,537
- Well, anyway,
um, you should come.

453
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,740
There's gonna be a picnic
and a fair.

454
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:24,542
And a dance.

455
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:25,943
You've got to come
to the dance.

456
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:26,944
- I do?

457
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:28,846
- Sure.
It's a town tradition.

458
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:30,982
You don't want to hurt
the town's feelings, do you?

459
00:17:30,984 --> 00:17:33,384
- I guess not.

460
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,786
- Um...

461
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:36,254
Let me help you
with the rest of these.

462
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:37,522
- Thanks.

463
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:39,257
OMG, he doesn't know
I'm hurricane Meg.

464
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:40,358
Mom was right.

465
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,726
Harvest hills is awesome.

466
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,628
This is gonna be
the best summer ever.

467
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,030
If only this bee
would leave me alone.

468
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:47,231
Smack!
- Ow!

469
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,900
- Oh, I am so sorry.
I really didn't mean to.

470
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:50,668
- Wow. You got a strong
right hook there, Meg.

471
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,136
- Oh, my god.
- Oh!

472
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:53,137
- I'm so sorry.

473
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:54,305
No, no,
it was an accident.

474
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:56,641
Here you go.
It was very nice to meet you.

475
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:57,875
- Nice to meet you.

476
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:59,010
Sorry.

477
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:00,411
- It's okay.
don't worry about it.

478
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,414
- Okay, curse,
this means war.

479
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:09,554
- Butt balloon activate!

480
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:10,988
- Sorry, grandpa.

481
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,156
Cool invention.

482
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:14,592
- Oh, it's handy
for napping anywhere.

483
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,361
- This stupid curse
is ruining my life.

484
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:20,731
I mean, look at the things
this family has gone through.

485
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:23,367
"Hiccupping man causes
circus stampede."

486
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,236
Okay, "man throws coin
in fountain,

487
00:18:25,238 --> 00:18:26,504
floods town."

488
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:27,705
- That was a lot of water.

489
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:29,807
- "Local youth
invents homework."

490
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:32,110
The Murphys invented homework?
Really?

491
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:33,411
[Both murmuring]

492
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:34,579
- It's been 100 years.

493
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:36,080
Why has no one ever tried
to break it?

494
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:37,081
- Oh, we've tried.
- Dad.

495
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,449
- Oh.

496
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,418
- What? Grandpa, is there
a way to break the curse?

497
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,453
- There are certain things
a Murphy must never do--

498
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,955
needlepoint,
whale watching.

499
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:46,657
But messing with the curse
is at the top of the list.

500
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:47,825
- So you admit you've tried it.

501
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:49,026
What do you do?

502
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:50,194
Do you got to a fortune-teller

503
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:51,662
or do a seance
or find a spell in a book?

504
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:53,331
- [Gasps]
- Ha! There's a book.

505
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,799
- Enough, Meg.

506
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,869
We've told you before
that the curse can't be broken.

507
00:18:57,871 --> 00:19:00,338
So don't make yourself miserable
by trying.

508
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,607
- Okay, so I guess I should just
stay miserable not trying.

509
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:03,608
- That is not what I meant.

510
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:04,842
- Trust us, Meg.

511
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:07,311
There are fates worse
than Murphy's law.

512
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,084
- She's getting too curious.

513
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:15,052
She doesn't know the chaos
that she can cause.

514
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:16,053
She'll--

515
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:17,455
- she won't find
the diary, son.

516
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:18,789
- But if she did--
- won't.

517
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:19,957
- I'm just saying---
- shush.

518
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,425
- I'm playing devil's--
- nope.

519
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:23,794
- Every time I--
- no.

520
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:28,966
- I looked everywhere
for this--this book,

521
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:30,434
but things are easily hidden

522
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:32,303
in grandpa's big old house.

523
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:36,874
And I probably should have
remembered Murphy rule 51.

524
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:37,875
[Sighs]

525
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:38,910
[Sniffs]

526
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:40,745
Never use matches.

[Explosion]

528
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:43,414
Whoa!

[Coughing]

531
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:06,003
Grandpa was right.

532
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:08,439
I didn't find the diary.

533
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,275
The diary found me.

534
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:17,014
[Chortles]

535
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:20,151
- Hey, hey
to all my fans.

536
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:21,686
I just made a new invention

537
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:24,555
that's gonna make my videos
even more awesome than before.

538
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,592
The dizzy cam.

539
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:29,961
World, you are so not ready
for this.

540
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:31,629
- Dude, this is gonna be
so rad.

541
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:33,030
- Dude, I know,
right?

542
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:35,433
- Let's go.
- All right.

543
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:38,302
- Go, go, go!

544
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,004
- You got this!

545
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:42,807
Whoa!

546
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:44,442
- Charlie's never landed
a trick

547
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:46,210
thanks to Murphy's curse.

548
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:47,612

00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:21,525
It was...

736
00:29:21,527 --> 00:29:23,060
An accident.

737
00:29:23,062 --> 00:29:25,028
- You being born
was an accident.

738
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,630
- If it makes you
feel any better,

739
00:29:26,632 --> 00:29:28,799
that was a pretty sweet wipeout.

740
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:30,467
- Who is this person
speaking to me?

741
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:32,503
- My brother.

742
00:29:32,505 --> 00:29:34,004
- There are more of you?

743
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:35,072
Ugh!

744
00:29:35,074 --> 00:29:37,074
Let's go.

745
00:29:38,344 --> 00:29:40,644
- Jeez, what's her problem?

746
00:29:40,646 --> 00:29:44,414
- So much for making friends
in harvest hills.

747
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:45,983
- Sorry, Meg.

748
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:50,621
Okay, so let me get
this straight.

749
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:51,688
You want to break the curse,

750
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,157
but you were warned not to,

751
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:54,424
which makes me want
to help,

752
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:56,326
but how do I get my money?

753
00:30:00,733 --> 00:30:01,999
- "If the curse
you want lifted,

754
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:03,467
"find the object
that was flipp-ed.

755
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:04,768
"Give it to the next O'Leary,

756
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,170
but be sure they
take it cheery."

757
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,540
- Yeah, I don't get it.

758
00:30:09,542 --> 00:30:11,041
- It's the key
to breaking the curse.

759
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:13,544
Great great grandpa Tommy
was cursed with a magic coin.

760
00:30:13,546 --> 00:30:14,745
That's what was flipped.

761
00:30:14,747 --> 00:30:16,413
If we give it back
to someone who's related

762
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:17,915
to that witch woman
Caitlin O'Leary

763
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:19,449
before the end
of the harvest dance,

764
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:20,751
we can end the curse forever.

765
00:30:20,753 --> 00:30:22,753
We just have to find
that coin.

766
00:30:22,755 --> 00:30:23,954
- But, Meg,
how are we supposed

767
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:25,756
to find some coin
from 100 years ago?

768
00:30:25,758 --> 00:30:27,191
It's not like he put an ad
in the paper

769
00:30:27,193 --> 00:30:28,458
saying where he spent it.

770
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,394
- Actually,

771
00:30:30,396 --> 00:30:32,162
he kind of did.

772
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:33,797
- "Man throws coin
in fountain,

773
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:35,132
floods town"?

774
00:30:35,134 --> 00:30:36,600
- Tommy threw the coin
in the fountain

775
00:30:36,602 --> 00:30:37,868
to try and wish
the curse away.

776
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,002
It didn't work,

777
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:40,671
and the coin caused a crack
in the fountain

778
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:41,672
that flooded downtown.

779
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:42,840
Typical Murphy.

780
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:45,742
- So where's this fountain?

781
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:46,743
[Water splashing]

782
00:30:46,745 --> 00:30:48,312
Hey, Meg.

783
00:30:48,314 --> 00:30:50,113
I found it.
There it is.

784
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:52,349
I solved the mystery.

785
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:53,717
- Go.

786
00:30:57,857 --> 00:30:58,956
- Which one is it?

787
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:00,123
- It's a 100-year-old coin.

788
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:01,925
I'm sure it's got
to stand out.

789
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:07,064
- Hey, Meg!

790
00:31:07,066 --> 00:31:08,498
- Brett.
- Quarters, pennies...

791
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,499
- Um, sorry.

792
00:31:09,501 --> 00:31:11,969
- Whoa!
[Splashing]

793
00:31:14,006 --> 00:31:15,472
What the?

794
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,145
- Hey.

795
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:23,780
- It's my favorite boxer.

796
00:31:23,782 --> 00:31:25,282
How does my nose look?
Is it crooked?

797
00:31:25,284 --> 00:31:26,483
- Your nose is perfect.

798
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:27,484
I mean,

799
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:28,819
perfectly straight.

800
00:31:28,821 --> 00:31:29,820
I'm sorry.

801
00:31:29,822 --> 00:31:31,054
After what I did,

802
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,656
I thought you'd want
to stay away from me.

803
00:31:32,658 --> 00:31:33,657
I'm a mess.

804
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:34,691
- Are you kidding?

805
00:31:34,693 --> 00:31:35,859
Of course not.

806
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:37,995
You seem like
a really cool mess.

807
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:40,664
Harvest hills can be
a pretty boring place.

808
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:42,866
But I feel like hanging out
with you,

809
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:45,102
I wouldn't be bored at all.

810
00:31:45,104 --> 00:31:46,637
Bleeding and terrified,
maybe,

811
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:48,005
but not boring.

812
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:49,139

Hey!

815
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:52,776
Hey, come on!

816
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:54,845
I could use some help here.

817
00:31:54,847 --> 00:31:56,046
A lot of coins,

818
00:31:56,048 --> 00:31:58,048
and I only have two hands!

819
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:00,150
- Is that kid trying to take
money out of the fountain?

820
00:32:00,152 --> 00:32:02,386
- Probably just
some crazy person.

821
00:32:02,388 --> 00:32:04,621
You were saying something
about hanging out with me?

822
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:06,924
[Fountains hissing]

823
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:08,425
- [Grunts]

824
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,027
- As long as you promise
to warn me

825
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:11,295
if you're gonna punch me again.

826
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:12,496
- I can't make any promises.

827
00:32:12,498 --> 00:32:14,064
These babies have
a mind of their own.

828
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:15,832
- [Laughs]

829
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:18,368
So I see your reading up
on the town history.

830
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,736
- Oh, this.

831
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:21,338
Yeah, um,

832
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,673
just a big fan of history.

833
00:32:22,675 --> 00:32:23,740
- Oh, me too.

834
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:25,175
Yeah, I actually used
to volunteer

835
00:32:25,177 --> 00:32:26,543
at the town historical society.

836
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:27,911
They have a whole display

837
00:32:27,913 --> 00:32:30,314
on the fountain flood
that destroyed harvest hills.

838
00:32:30,316 --> 00:32:32,282
- And the stupid little coin
that started it.

839
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,583
- Wow.

840
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:36,119
You really do know
the history.

- [Grunting]

842
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:46,263
- It's kind of crazy
how a small thing like that

843
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:48,165
could cause such a mess.

844
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:49,866
They have the actual coin
on display there.

845
00:32:49,868 --> 00:32:51,234
- They do?

846
00:32:51,236 --> 00:32:53,403
I mean, oh.

847
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:54,404
That's cool.

So...

853
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:03,914
I was wondering...

854
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:04,915
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

855
00:33:04,917 --> 00:33:09,152
If maybe you would, um...

856
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:10,253
- Oh, my gosh.

857
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:11,788
Is he going to ask me out?

858
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,690
No, don't be ridiculous, Meg.
Why would--

859
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:16,626
- do you want to go to the
harvest festival dance with me?

860
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:18,261
- Sure.
[Chuckles]

861
00:33:18,263 --> 00:33:19,363
Why not?

865
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:26,003
I should go.

866
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:28,205
And I will see you later.

867
00:33:28,207 --> 00:33:29,206
- All right.
Bye.

of the coin.

how to get it.

You know,
the harvest dance

904
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:11,108
is where your father took me
on our first date.

of my whole life.

your father got sprayed

Mm, you see?
It's like I always told you.

as long as you have
the right attitude, right?

913
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:28,825
- Wrong.

914
00:35:28,827 --> 00:35:30,160
I was happy because I
was a day away

919
00:35:43,442 --> 00:35:45,442
it's time for this
a-cha-ching-cha-ching.

920
00:35:45,444 --> 00:35:46,743
- And what does that mean?

921
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:47,944
- Money?

922
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:49,146
I mean, you got to pay up.

923
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:50,514
I helped you look
for the coin.

924
00:35:50,516 --> 00:35:51,781
- Yeah, right.

925
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:53,483
You don't get paid
until we break the curse.

926
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:54,684
And we still don't have the coin

927
00:35:54,686 --> 00:35:56,253
or know who
Caitlin's descendants are.

928
00:35:56,255 --> 00:35:58,555
You have earned zero dollars.

929
00:35:58,557 --> 00:35:59,856
- Aw, jeez.

930
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:01,758
You know, you're going
through a lot of trouble

931
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,859
just for some boy.

932
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:04,161
- I'm not doing this
for some boy.

933
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:05,896
I'm doing this for us,
for our family,

934
00:36:05,898 --> 00:36:08,431
so our lives can finally
be normal.

935
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:10,834
- Meg...

936
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:12,569
I don't know if I want
my life to be normal.

937
00:36:12,571 --> 00:36:13,803
- What are you talking about?

938
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:15,272
- It's just,

939
00:36:15,274 --> 00:36:16,506
what about my skating?

940
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,441
If we break the curse,
then...

941
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:20,577
I won't be a master
of destruction anymore.

942
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:21,645
- [Scoffs]

943
00:36:21,647 --> 00:36:22,779
don't worry, buddy.

944
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:24,014
Even without the curse,

945
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:26,850
you're probably still
a terrible skater.

946
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:27,851
- Thanks, Meg.

947
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:29,319
- The dance is tomorrow,

948
00:36:29,321 --> 00:36:31,621
so we're breaking into that
historical building tonight.

949
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:33,023
And we need to get a coin

950
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:34,858
and find out who's related
to Caitlin O'Leary.

951
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,859
- All right.

952
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:36,860
Heist time!

953
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:38,962
- Shh.

954
00:36:38,964 --> 00:36:41,731
[Whispering]
Heist time.

955
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:48,071
[Owl hooting]

956
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:49,873
- [Sighs]

957
00:36:58,183 --> 00:36:59,616
- What?

958
00:36:59,618 --> 00:37:01,885
It's the only black clothes
I own.

959
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:03,820
- Okay, but why bring
the wand?

960
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:08,225
- [Sighs]

961
00:37:08,227 --> 00:37:10,493
[Dog barking distantly]

962
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,430
All of harvest hills'
historical treasure

963
00:37:13,432 --> 00:37:15,065
is guarded
by impenetrable security,

964
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:16,233
but I have a plan.

965
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:17,367
We'll get in from above

966
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:18,668
through the skylight.

967
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,903
You will repel
to the roof,

968
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:21,805
then through the skylight
with glass cutters.

969
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:25,008
I'll create a distraction here
to mask the noise.

970
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,476
Here's where it gets
a little tricky.

971
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:27,944
You've seen spider-man,
right?

972
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:30,614
Take these suction cups and...

973
00:37:30,616 --> 00:37:33,450
- Hey, sweet.
It's unlocked.

974
00:37:33,452 --> 00:37:35,018
- Can do it that way.

975
00:37:39,658 --> 00:37:41,324
Come on.

976
00:37:41,326 --> 00:37:42,525
- [Groans]

977
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:43,994
- [Whispering]
don't make any sound,

978
00:37:43,996 --> 00:37:45,428
and don't touch anything.

979
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:48,665
- Like there's anything
in here I'd want to touch.

980
00:37:54,473 --> 00:37:55,872
Hey, check it out.

981
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:57,107
She's picking my nose.

982
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:58,842
- Stop messing around.

983
00:37:58,844 --> 00:38:00,877
- [Sighs]

984
00:38:05,651 --> 00:38:07,350
I've no idea
what you're saying.

985
00:38:07,352 --> 00:38:08,852
- I'm gonna go look
over there.

986
00:38:08,854 --> 00:38:10,520
- Fine. You go look
for the coin.

987
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:12,822
I'm gonna try and find
the town records.

988
00:38:31,043 --> 00:38:33,009
- Uh!

989
00:38:51,229 --> 00:38:53,063
Whoa.

990
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,710
Ha-ha.

991
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:20,557
Meg, I got it.
I found the coin.

992
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:21,825
- Nice.

993
00:39:21,827 --> 00:39:23,093
- Aw, yeah.

994
00:39:23,095 --> 00:39:25,395
I saw the target,
and I acquired it.

995
00:39:25,397 --> 00:39:27,397
I slipped in and out
of the shadows silent

996
00:39:27,399 --> 00:39:28,698
and undetected.

997
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,833
Yep.

998
00:39:29,835 --> 00:39:31,735
I'm pretty much a ninja.

999
00:39:31,737 --> 00:39:34,471
[Clattering]

1000
00:39:34,473 --> 00:39:35,939
- Shh.

1001
00:39:35,941 --> 00:39:37,173
[Keys jingling]

1002
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:38,942
Quick.
Hide.

1003
00:39:45,117 --> 00:39:47,183
[Keys jingling]

1004
00:39:50,756 --> 00:39:53,757
[Jingling footsteps]

1005
00:40:07,806 --> 00:40:09,639
- [Grunting]

1006
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:11,841
[Clattering]

1007
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:31,461
- Hm.

1008
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:45,542
[Door closes]

1009
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:48,144
Man, that was so close.

1010
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:49,179
- Okay.

1011
00:40:49,181 --> 00:40:50,947
I figured it out.

1012
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:55,718
If Caitlin O'Leary
had a baby,

1013
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,953
and that baby had a baby,

1014
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:58,955
and on and on
for five generations,

1015
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:01,925
then this book shows everyone
who's related to them.

1016
00:41:01,927 --> 00:41:04,194
It goes all the way down
to present day.

1017
00:41:04,196 --> 00:41:05,862
So according to this,

1018
00:41:05,864 --> 00:41:07,897
the most recent descendent
of Caitlin O'Leary

1019
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:12,535
and the person we have
to give the coin to is...

1020
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:14,838
Oh.

1021
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,307
- Well, who is it?

1022
00:41:21,446 --> 00:41:22,812
- Ivy.

1023
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,180
I should have guessed.

1024
00:41:24,182 --> 00:41:25,849
The girl who dubbed me
hurricane Meg

1025
00:41:25,851 --> 00:41:27,417
is the descendent
of the woman

1026
00:41:27,419 --> 00:41:30,386
who caused the hurricane
in the first place.

1027
00:41:30,388 --> 00:41:31,554
- Target acquired.

1028
00:41:31,556 --> 00:41:34,290
- I'm gonna get
into position.

1029
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:37,093
- ¶ All the lights,
turn them off ¶

1030
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:38,695
¶ it's too loud
in here to talk ¶

1031
00:41:38,697 --> 00:41:42,065
¶ I don't understand
a word you're saying ¶

1032
00:41:42,067 --> 00:41:44,000
¶ I'm trying to sleep,
but instead ¶

1033
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:46,369
¶ karaoke on the bed ¶

1034
00:41:48,106 --> 00:41:50,373
- as I watched Ivy,
I couldn't help thinking,

1035
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:52,008
what if this curse
somehow sensed

1036
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,510
I was about to break it?

1037
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:55,445
It would do anything it could
to stop me.

1038
00:41:55,447 --> 00:41:57,113
I would have to be more careful
than ever

1039
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:58,681
if I wanted
to survive long enough to--

1040
00:41:58,683 --> 00:41:59,682
- hey, Meg.

1041
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,050
Hey, Meg,
does this thing work?

1042
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:02,652
- Stop interrupting
my inner monologue.

1043
00:42:02,654 --> 00:42:03,653
Yes, it works, Charlie.

1044
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:04,687
You don't have to scream.

1045
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:05,922
Where are you?

1046
00:42:05,924 --> 00:42:07,223
- Tonight my name
is nighthawk,

1047
00:42:07,225 --> 00:42:08,324
and I'm up in the lights.

1048
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:09,759
I'm a go.

1049
00:42:09,761 --> 00:42:11,094
- I'm not calling you
nighthawk.

1050
00:42:11,096 --> 00:42:12,795
- Please?
Please, please, please?

1051
00:42:12,797 --> 00:42:13,796
- Oh, my god,
okay, fine.

1052
00:42:13,798 --> 00:42:15,131
- What's fine?

1053
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:17,300
- Uh, you.

1054
00:42:17,302 --> 00:42:19,536
You're looking...

1055
00:42:19,538 --> 00:42:20,637
Fine.

1056
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:21,905
- [Makes retching noise]

1057
00:42:21,907 --> 00:42:23,373
- Ha, shut up.

1058
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:26,142
I mean, wow.
I should shut up.

1059
00:42:26,144 --> 00:42:29,145
I mean,
hi.

1060
00:42:29,147 --> 00:42:31,681
- Uh, hi to you too.

1061
00:42:31,683 --> 00:42:33,550
You look really pretty
tonight.

1062
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:35,118
Do you want
to go get some punch?

1063
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,220
- No,
me and punch are a bad idea,

1064
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:38,755
with the spilling
and whatnot.

1065
00:42:38,757 --> 00:42:39,856
- Get your raffle tickets.

1066
00:42:39,858 --> 00:42:41,057
What about you,
young lady?

1067
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,058
- Oh, no, thank you.

1068
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,660
- You could win
an all-expense-paid trip

1069
00:42:43,662 --> 00:42:44,661
to the grand canyon.

1070
00:42:44,663 --> 00:42:45,662
- Trust me.
I won't win.

1071
00:42:45,664 --> 00:42:47,897
Not in 100 years.
0% chance.

1072
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:49,165
- Here you go.

1073
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:50,466
- What's the name
for the ticket?

1074
00:42:50,468 --> 00:42:51,901
- Meg Murphy.

1075
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:56,839
Thanks.

1076
00:42:56,841 --> 00:42:59,542
So I present to you as a
"thank you" for being my date

1077
00:42:59,544 --> 00:43:02,946
a 0% chance
of winning a vacation.

1078
00:43:02,948 --> 00:43:04,714
Or maybe tonight
your luck will change.

1079
00:43:04,716 --> 00:43:06,316
- Thank you.
And I hope so.

1080
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:08,418
- Oh, and it's also
your lucky day

1081
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,653
because you get to embarrass
yourself on the dance floor

1082
00:43:10,655 --> 00:43:11,988
with me right now.

1083
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:13,189
But I have to warn you.

1084
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:14,991
I got moves.

1085
00:43:14,993 --> 00:43:16,059
It's the lawnmower.

1086
00:43:16,061 --> 00:43:17,527
What?
It's the running man.

1087
00:43:17,529 --> 00:43:18,561
I'm a sprinkler.

1088
00:43:18,563 --> 00:43:19,762
- Stop, stop,
I can't take it.

1089
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:20,863
You're too good.

1090
00:43:20,865 --> 00:43:22,231
- [Laughs]

1091
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:24,133
Shall we?

1092
00:43:24,135 --> 00:43:25,401
- Yes.

1093
00:43:25,403 --> 00:43:26,636
- Remember the mission.

1094
00:43:26,638 --> 00:43:28,271
Target's
in the refreshment area.

1095
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:30,406
- I mean, no.

1096
00:43:30,408 --> 00:43:32,675
I mean,

1276
00:50:04,669 --> 00:50:07,136
and makes houses fall down
and stuff.

1277
00:50:07,138 --> 00:50:08,304
Aren't you happy?

1278
00:50:08,306 --> 00:50:10,573
- Honey, um,
who did you give the coin to?

1279
00:50:10,575 --> 00:50:12,441
- Brett,
and it ended the curse.

1280
00:50:12,443 --> 00:50:14,477
- No, Meg.

1281
00:50:14,479 --> 00:50:16,879
You didn't end the curse.

1282
00:50:16,881 --> 00:50:19,482
You transferred it
to--to Brett and his family.

1283
00:50:19,484 --> 00:50:21,450
- And now he's doomed.

1284
00:50:21,452 --> 00:50:22,685
It all makes sense now.

1285
00:50:22,687 --> 00:50:24,120
- What are you talking about?

1286
00:50:24,122 --> 00:50:25,721
- It's the last verse
of the rhyme

1287
00:50:25,723 --> 00:50:27,490
from Tommy's diary.

1288
00:50:27,492 --> 00:50:30,760
"By harvest night,
complete this verse..."

1289

All: "And the o'learys
shall receive the curse."

1290
00:50:49,147 --> 00:50:51,480
- This line has been
temporarily disconnected.

1291
00:50:51,482 --> 00:50:52,748
- Never a good sign.

1292
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:54,650
This has to be some sort
of horrible mistake.

1293
00:50:54,652 --> 00:50:56,552
Seriously,
Brett was fine.

1294
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:57,586
I think.

1295
00:50:57,588 --> 00:50:58,754
I mean, I could never--

1296
00:50:58,756 --> 00:51:02,258
I would never transfer
the curse to him.

1297
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:03,559
I was just trying
to get rid of it.

1298

[All murmuring]

1299
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:07,596
Hey, is there any way I can
transfer the curse back to us?

1300
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:08,964
- I'm afraid not.

1301
00:51:08,966 --> 00:51:11,300
The curse can only be broken
during the harvest dance.

1302
00:51:11,302 --> 00:51:12,768
- I don't believe this.

1303
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:14,136

1304
00:51:14,138 --> 00:51:15,971
before I get my first kiss.

1305
00:51:19,343 --> 00:51:20,342
- I got this, honey.

1306
00:51:20,344 --> 00:51:22,078
- Uh,
yeah, I'll go.

1307
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,447
- I was hoping you
were gonna say that.

1308
00:51:24,449 --> 00:51:27,083
- Now that I'm normal,
I'm supposed to be happy.

1309
00:51:27,085 --> 00:51:30,886
But instead I'm more miserable
than ever.

1310
00:51:30,888 --> 00:51:32,955
- Honey, I--I don't know
why you thought

1311
00:51:32,957 --> 00:51:35,324
you needed to be normal
to be happy in the first place.

1312
00:51:35,326 --> 00:51:38,561
- Because how can anyone be
happy when they're jinxed?

1313
00:51:38,563 --> 00:51:41,530
- You know, I wasn't born
a Murphy.

1314
00:51:41,532 --> 00:51:45,134
For 20 years, I lived
a perfectly normal life.

1315
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:48,437
And I will tell you
a secret.

1316
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:52,408
Since I married your father
and I took this curse on,

1317
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:54,643
I have never been happier.

1318
00:51:55,847 --> 00:51:57,680
Oh, sweetie.

1319
00:51:57,682 --> 00:51:59,915
I told you before,
this curse does not determine

1320
00:51:59,917 --> 00:52:03,285
whether or not your life
is good or bad or happy

1321
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:04,720
or lonely.

1322
00:52:04,722 --> 00:52:06,689
You do.

1323
00:52:06,691 --> 00:52:08,190
- But it's too late.

1324
00:52:08,192 --> 00:52:10,759
I've already given
the curse to Brett.

1325
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:13,195
It's over.

1326
00:52:13,197 --> 00:52:14,296
- No, it's not over.

1327
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:15,564
- What?
How?

1328
00:52:15,566 --> 00:52:17,233
- I took a second look
at the diary.

1329
00:52:17,235 --> 00:52:19,802
The curse must be broken
by the end of the festival,

1330
00:52:19,804 --> 00:52:20,970
not the dance.

1331
00:52:20,972 --> 00:52:23,038
The festival--
back then,

1332
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,574
the dance
was the very last event.

1333
00:52:25,576 --> 00:52:27,042
- But it isn't anymore.

1334
00:52:27,044 --> 00:52:29,345
The festival doesn't end
until the closing ceremonies.

1335
00:52:29,347 --> 00:52:31,547
- So that means I can still take
the curse back from Brett.

1336
00:52:31,549 --> 00:52:32,748
- Yeah.
- I'm going to his house.

1337

you only have an hour.

1338

1340

an hour without the curse.

1344
00:52:44,262 --> 00:52:46,228

Is it cool if I use this

1347

of your trees?

1348
00:52:50,735 --> 00:52:51,734
- Sure, son.

1349
00:52:51,736 --> 00:52:52,768
- Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1350
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:56,138
No curse!

1351
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:57,439
- I can run!

1352

Without tripping or--
or hitting tree branches.

1353
00:53:00,178 --> 00:53:02,111

is what normal feels like.

No worries, no fear
of everyday things

1355

1357

Wait.

1358

good-bye science camp,
good-bye normal.

1361

- What are you doing here?

1373
00:54:17,922 --> 00:54:19,888
- Not that it's any
of your business,

1374
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:21,590
but my house fell down today.

1375

Then I come
to my cousin's house,

1376
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:25,227
and there's an angry monkey
tearing the place apart.

1377

Now you show up,

the worst day ever.

And I'm sorry,
but I need to find Brett.

here's the thing.

might have possibly,

and your entire family.

It's been kind of
a crazy day.

1455
00:57:29,447 --> 00:57:32,014
I had to outrun
a bitey raccoon.

1456
00:57:32,016 --> 00:57:33,015
But I think I lost him.

1457
00:57:33,017 --> 00:57:35,584
- Um, okay.

1458

Let's all give a big hand
to Brett Taylor

1459

Thanks to his tireless community
service for our great town.

1462
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:50,899
Now, once he climbs up there
and lowers the festival flag,

1463
00:57:50,901 --> 00:57:54,002
another festival of fun
will officially end.

1464
00:57:54,004 --> 00:57:55,637
Okay, son.

1465
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:57,673

you were doing

these awful things
to me on purpose.

I thought you were out
to get me.

1481

I've been unfair to you.

1482

You really were cursed.

1483
00:58:55,065 --> 00:58:58,800
- It's okay.

1484
00:58:58,802 --> 00:59:00,102
I should have been nicer
as well.

1485
00:59:00,104 --> 00:59:02,170
I mean,
I never really realized

1486
00:59:02,172 --> 00:59:05,941
how much my hurricane can get
other people caught in it.

1487
00:59:05,943 --> 00:59:07,142
If it makes you feel any better,

1488

I've fallen
in enough mud puddles

1489
00:59:08,512 --> 00:59:10,178

for your skin.

Do you want me
to climb up there instead?

- No, just stay right there

and don't look up until I take
the curse back from Brett,

1510

from the sky

if you do.

- are you gonna go already?

I don't want to be normal.

I want to be me,
hurricane Meg, a Murphy.

And cursed or not,

1526
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,573
if I can climb a ladder,

I've seen all day.

It's been kind of crazy.

and it's all my fault.

1534

- What?

1536
01:01:37,461 --> 01:01:39,695
- You see, my family was cursed
with bad luck by a witch,

1537
01:01:39,697 --> 01:01:42,164
and then I sort of gave it
to you.

1538

I'm sorry.

yeah.

That coin I gave you last night,
do you still have it?

- Uh, yeah,
I kept it,

1543
01:01:51,241 --> 01:01:52,307
I thought for good luck.

I can take the curse back.

1546

All you have to do
is give it to me.

1547

- No.

01:01:57,014 --> 01:01:58,013

to suffer from bad luck either.

it's not like that.

don't get me wrong.

1631
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:58,553
I'm happy we're
leaving harvest hills

1632
01:05:58,555 --> 01:05:59,721
to go to the grand canyon,

1633
01:05:59,723 --> 01:06:01,790
but I'm going to miss
my new best friend.

1634
01:06:01,792 --> 01:06:03,191
- Meg.
- You heard me right.

1635
01:06:03,193 --> 01:06:04,759
I have a best friend.

1636
01:06:04,761 --> 01:06:05,961
She truly gets me,

1637
01:06:05,963 --> 01:06:06,995
curse and all.

1638
01:06:06,997 --> 01:06:08,163
What are you guys doing here?

1639
01:06:08,165 --> 01:06:09,564
- We had to come
and say good-bye

1640
01:06:09,566 --> 01:06:11,599
and remind you about rule 34.

1641
01:06:11,601 --> 01:06:12,767
Careful on road trips.

1642
01:06:12,769 --> 01:06:16,004
- And you be careful
of angry monkeys.

1643
01:06:16,006 --> 01:06:17,005
I'll see you in school.

1644
01:06:17,007 --> 01:06:19,607
- Yeah.

1645
01:06:19,609 --> 01:06:21,376
- Hey.
- Hey.

1646
01:06:27,718 --> 01:06:28,817
[Trunk slams]

1647
01:06:28,819 --> 01:06:31,753
- Standing right here.

1648
01:06:31,755 --> 01:06:33,054
Okay.

1649
01:06:34,958 --> 01:06:36,691
- [Chortles]

1650
01:06:39,296 --> 01:06:40,762
See you when you get back,
okay?

1651
01:06:40,764 --> 01:06:42,230
Call me when you get there,
all right?

1652
01:06:42,232 --> 01:06:43,264
- Okay.

1653
01:06:43,266 --> 01:06:44,966
See you guys later.

1654
01:06:47,637 --> 01:06:51,873
You know, I think we all feel
like we're cursed at times.

1655
01:06:56,246 --> 01:06:57,379
- What?

1656
01:06:57,381 --> 01:06:59,147
- Move over,
little brother.

1657
01:07:02,052 --> 01:07:03,752
The question is,

1658
01:07:03,754 --> 01:07:05,720
are you gonna let it define
who you are.

1659
01:07:05,722 --> 01:07:08,156
- Hey, dad, we're going
to the grand canyon, right?

1660
01:07:08,158 --> 01:07:09,290
- Yep.

1661
01:07:09,292 --> 01:07:11,192
- But isn't
Murphy rule number 82

1662
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:12,560
to stay away from canyons?

1663
01:07:12,562 --> 01:07:15,864
- I think it's time
we bent the rules just a little.

1664
01:07:17,034 --> 01:07:18,033
[Bungee cord snaps]

1665
01:07:18,035 --> 01:07:20,268
[Electrical zapping]

1666
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:22,070
Both: Uh-oh.

1667
01:07:23,707 --> 01:07:25,740
- Uh-oh.

1668
01:07:25,742 --> 01:07:26,775
Zap!

1669
01:07:26,777 --> 01:07:29,878
- Whoo!

1670
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:32,814
[Crashing]

1671
01:07:34,451 --> 01:07:36,184
- ¶ The reason why ¶

1672
01:07:40,524 --> 01:07:43,224
- ¶ I thought I was too young
for love ¶

1673

¶ to think that there
could be just one ¶

1674

¶ I was never too good
at romance ¶

¶ or maybe just never had
a chance ¶

¶ to love the right girl ¶

1678
01:08:01,945 --> 01:08:04,646

¶ that this would be
a crime scene ¶

1680
01:08:07,217 --> 01:08:11,486
¶ and I would be the one
to fall ¶

1681

¶ slingshot ¶

1682
01:08:12,789 --> 01:08:15,356

¶ smile so sweet,
I hit the ground ¶

¶ k.O.,

won't get up again ¶

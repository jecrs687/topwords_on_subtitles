1
00:01:42,781 --> 00:01:44,450
All the food's gonna go bad.

2
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,354
Yeah, I drew up a list.

3
00:01:48,454 --> 00:01:51,707
I'll hit the store
before it gets all bought out.

4
00:01:54,376 --> 00:01:55,402
Fuck.

5
00:01:55,502 --> 00:01:57,947
- Can you save it?
- No. No way.

6
00:01:58,047 --> 00:02:00,616
No, I gotta start over from scratch.

7
00:02:00,716 --> 00:02:02,952
I'll call the studio
when the phones get back up,

8
00:02:03,052 --> 00:02:04,678
see if they can extend my deadline.

9
00:02:05,888 --> 00:02:07,556
What choice do they have?

10
00:02:10,225 --> 00:02:11,210
You kiddin'?

11
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,088
They could whip up some bad
Photoshop poster in an afternoon.

12
00:02:14,188 --> 00:02:16,423
They do it all the time.
Two big heads.

13
00:02:16,523 --> 00:02:18,425
I should have brought it downstairs
with me last night.

14
00:02:18,525 --> 00:02:20,135
Just stupid, I guess.

15
00:02:20,235 --> 00:02:22,221
Well, sweetie,
you couldn't exactly know

16
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:24,223
that a tree was gonna come flying
through the window.

17
00:02:24,323 --> 00:02:25,724
Yeah, I'll hit the
hardware store too,

18
00:02:25,824 --> 00:02:27,351
get some plastic sheeting
and duct tape

19
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:29,603
and seal this up
before it gets dark, you know.

20
00:02:29,703 --> 00:02:31,288
Order in some new glass.

21
00:02:32,748 --> 00:02:34,066
Oh, you know what?
That was your--

22
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,694
that was your grandfather's tree,
the one he planted.

23
00:02:36,794 --> 00:02:39,488
Used to play in that tree.

24
00:02:39,588 --> 00:02:40,739
It's just stuff, though.

25
00:02:40,839 --> 00:02:43,284
You know, we're safe.
That's all that counts.

26
00:02:43,384 --> 00:02:44,451
Yeah.

27
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:46,120
Mom, Dad, you gotta come see!

28
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,955
Hey, Billy, take it easy, all right?

29
00:02:48,055 --> 00:02:49,748
I really don't want you running
all over the place.

30
00:02:49,848 --> 00:02:50,916
But you gotta come look.

31
00:02:51,016 --> 00:02:54,003
The boathouse is all bashed!
Holy crap!

32
00:02:54,103 --> 00:02:55,212
Billy.

33
00:02:55,312 --> 00:02:58,357
Sorry, Mom, but you just
gotta come! Come on!

34
00:02:58,557 --> 00:02:59,757
Whoa!

35
00:02:59,996 --> 00:03:01,296
Whoa.

36
00:03:02,602 --> 00:03:03,304
<i>Come on.</i>

37
00:03:03,404 --> 00:03:05,306
Having spoken,
the Doomsayer departs.

38
00:03:05,406 --> 00:03:07,975
<i>Come on!</i>

39
00:03:08,075 --> 00:03:10,077
How do you two always manage
to make me laugh?

40
00:03:11,078 --> 00:03:13,772
You have incredibly low standards.

41
00:03:13,872 --> 00:03:16,859
Let's go, see the damage.

42
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:17,960
No.

43
00:03:22,923 --> 00:03:25,092
- Norton's tree.
- Yeah?

44
00:03:26,593 --> 00:03:28,495
You mean the dead one
I've been asking him

45
00:03:28,595 --> 00:03:30,706
to take down for three years
before it finally blew over?

46
00:03:30,806 --> 00:03:31,807
That tree?

47
00:03:32,975 --> 00:03:36,061
- Really got smooshed.
- You ain't kiddin'.

48
00:03:37,438 --> 00:03:39,106
Look at that.

49
00:03:41,242 --> 00:03:42,568
What is it, Daddy?

50
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:44,570
Mist.

51
00:03:46,113 --> 00:03:48,974
- On the lake?
- We've had mist on the lake before.

52
00:03:49,074 --> 00:03:50,976
Coming off the mountain like that?

53
00:03:51,076 --> 00:03:53,520
Two fronts meeting,

54
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,856
left over from the storm,
something like that.

55
00:03:55,956 --> 00:03:57,399
You sure?

56
00:03:57,499 --> 00:03:58,901
Honey, I'm not the weatherman.

57
00:03:59,001 --> 00:04:01,153
Why don't you take Billy,
get him dressed.

58
00:04:01,253 --> 00:04:02,529
I'll take him to town with me.

59
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:03,989
Okay. Where you going?

60
00:04:04,089 --> 00:04:07,159
I'm gonna go have a little chat
with our neighbor about his tree.

61
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:08,327
Hon.

62
00:04:08,427 --> 00:04:10,412
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
punch him in the nose.

63
00:04:10,512 --> 00:04:11,789
You know what he's gonna say.

64
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:14,917
He's gonna say, "Sue me,"
which, I don't know, maybe we should.

65
00:04:15,017 --> 00:04:19,463
Honey, one property dispute
with this guy is enough to last me a lifetime.

66
00:04:19,563 --> 00:04:22,424
I'm gonna ask
for his insurance information.

67
00:04:22,524 --> 00:04:24,301
- Okay.
- That's all.

68
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:25,694
Yeah.

69
00:04:29,405 --> 00:04:31,041
<i>Motherfucker!</i>

70
00:04:34,211 --> 00:04:35,312
Shit!

71
00:04:35,812 --> 00:04:37,915
You motherfucker!

72
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,250
Cocksucker!

73
00:04:42,377 --> 00:04:43,404
"Turn on."

74
00:04:43,504 --> 00:04:45,656
"Full choke."

75
00:04:45,756 --> 00:04:47,925
"Pull five... choke."

76
00:04:52,387 --> 00:04:53,847
I guess you've seen the--

77
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,417
boathouse.

78
00:04:56,517 --> 00:04:57,793
Yeah, and--?

79
00:04:57,893 --> 00:04:59,503
Nothin'.

80
00:04:59,603 --> 00:05:02,881
Just think we should trade
insurance info, you know?

81
00:05:02,981 --> 00:05:04,024
That's all.

82
00:05:06,693 --> 00:05:09,238
Oh, my insurance guy's
gonna love me.

83
00:05:13,492 --> 00:05:15,436
Shit. The 1980.

84
00:05:15,536 --> 00:05:17,371
I was gonna bring
the station wagon, but...

85
00:05:18,872 --> 00:05:21,743
I don't know, the weather was so
beautiful coming out of New York,

86
00:05:21,844 --> 00:05:22,985
I just-- you know, top down.

87
00:05:23,085 --> 00:05:24,820
I'm sorry, man. I mean it.

88
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,380
Sincerely.

89
00:05:28,048 --> 00:05:30,701
- That's nice of you to say.
- No, that car was cherry.

90
00:05:30,801 --> 00:05:32,469
I hate to see it like that.

91
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:36,874
Okay, I'll tell you what,

92
00:05:36,974 --> 00:05:39,751
I'll find my insurance guy's number,
I'll bring it by later.

93
00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:41,395
- That okay?
- No problem.

94
00:05:47,693 --> 00:05:48,735
So, David--

95
00:05:50,571 --> 00:05:53,907
you're not heading into town today
by any chance, are you?

96
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,325
Well, CMP's out in force.

97
00:06:11,425 --> 00:06:12,993
Maybe we'll get our power back.

98
00:06:13,093 --> 00:06:15,078
I know. Some storm, huh?

99
00:06:15,178 --> 00:06:16,497
One for the books, yeah.

100
00:06:16,597 --> 00:06:18,207
For a moment there last night,

101
00:06:18,307 --> 00:06:20,709
I thought we were gonna take off
and head for Oz.

102
00:06:20,809 --> 00:06:22,836
WZON is off the air,

103
00:06:22,936 --> 00:06:25,088
but Portland's still broadcasting.

104
00:06:25,188 --> 00:06:28,050
Daddy, look.

105
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,801
Guys from the base.

106
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:31,929
From up the mountain?

107
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:33,488
The Arrowhead Project?

108
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,018
Well, you're a local.
Any idea what they do up there?

109
00:06:38,118 --> 00:06:39,603
Missile defense research...

110
00:06:39,703 --> 00:06:41,480
You know, I'm sure
you've heard the stories.

111
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,606
Oh, sure.

112
00:06:42,706 --> 00:06:45,025
The woman at the Laundromat
says that,

113
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:48,237
they have a crashed flying saucer
up there with frozen alien bodies.

114
00:06:48,337 --> 00:06:50,030
Right. Miss Edna. Yeah.

115
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,699
Miss Tabloid.

116
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:55,469
"I Had Bigfoot's Baby."

117
00:06:56,762 --> 00:06:59,289
"Satan's Face Appears
in Oil Well Fire."

118
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:00,724
You know, real reliable stuff.

119
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:06,922
Well, they're in a hurry.

120
00:07:07,022 --> 00:07:08,690
Maybe their power's out too.

121
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:18,892
Huh. Still no signal.

122
00:07:18,992 --> 00:07:22,187
Why don't you go ahead?
I'm gonna try Steph on a pay phone.

123
00:07:22,287 --> 00:07:23,939
Can I go with Mr. Norton, Daddy?

124
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:26,733
Sure, if you promise
to hold his hand, I guess.

125
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:27,859
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

126
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,528
Here's a list.

127
00:07:29,628 --> 00:07:30,946
- Sure.
- Okay?

128
00:07:31,046 --> 00:07:32,297
Meet you guys in there.

129
00:07:34,299 --> 00:07:35,550
Hold hands.

130
00:07:39,054 --> 00:07:41,431
I'm sorry.
I didn't know it was your sister.

131
00:07:45,936 --> 00:07:47,938
Those look so freaky!

132
00:07:56,905 --> 00:07:58,682
- Sally, hey.
- Hey, Mr. Drayton.

133
00:07:58,782 --> 00:08:00,100
You guys look jammed up.

134
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,270
Yeah, well, half the staff
didn't show, plus the power's out.

135
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,689
Oh, no. What, no backup generator?

136
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:07,274
Only to keep the food cold.

137
00:08:07,374 --> 00:08:10,235
Everything else, welcome to the Dark Ages,
and bring your checkbook.

138
00:08:10,335 --> 00:08:13,030
Hey, Thursday night,
Steph and I want a date night.

139
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,257
- Baby-sit?
- Heck, yeah. I'm there.

140
00:08:16,717 --> 00:08:17,784
Oh, my God.

141
00:08:17,884 --> 00:08:19,411
The storm.

142
00:08:19,511 --> 00:08:22,497
Everybody's stockin' up.
Been like this since we opened.

143
00:08:22,597 --> 00:08:23,832
Crappy day, huh?

144
00:08:23,932 --> 00:08:26,293
Eh, everyone's a little
pissed off this morning.

145
00:08:26,393 --> 00:08:28,228
'Morning, Mrs. Carmody.

146
00:08:29,396 --> 00:08:31,965
With lines like these,
I don't know how good it is,

147
00:08:32,065 --> 00:08:34,276
but I guess we'll have to make do.

148
00:08:35,277 --> 00:08:37,779
- Keep your head down, pal.
- I know it.

149
00:08:41,491 --> 00:08:42,617
Hey, champ.

150
00:08:43,744 --> 00:08:45,020
Your wife should be a doctor.

151
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,439
She could make a fortune
in Manhattan with this handwriting.

152
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:50,150
Yeah, it takes some getting used to.

153
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,361
Why don't you get your stuff?
I'll meet you at the checkout.

154
00:08:52,461 --> 00:08:53,503
Okay, done.

155
00:08:56,256 --> 00:08:59,384
Hey, David,
thanks for helping me out today.

156
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,624
Are you and Mr. Norton
gonna be friends now, Daddy?

157
00:09:05,724 --> 00:09:10,061
Oh, I don't know.
"Friends" might be stretching it a little.

158
00:09:11,062 --> 00:09:13,465
I guess you're not mad
at each other any more.

159
00:09:13,565 --> 00:09:14,716
I guess not.

160
00:09:14,816 --> 00:09:18,069
Hey. And that's a start, huh?

161
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,181
I'm sorry, ma'am,
the registers are down.

162
00:09:21,281 --> 00:09:23,100
The power outage got us too.

163
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,869
Hopefully we'll have
power up pretty soon.

164
00:09:35,712 --> 00:09:38,365
- The bus leaves in 30 minutes.
- We'll make it, okay?

165
00:09:38,465 --> 00:09:40,759
You guys get the goodies.
I'll wait in line.

166
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:44,805
Yes, ma'am, those are $1.25.

167
00:09:45,806 --> 00:09:47,933
I need some change on register five.

168
00:09:49,476 --> 00:09:51,336
Good morning, Ms. Reppler.

169
00:09:51,436 --> 00:09:52,879
Hello, Ms. Reppler.

170
00:09:52,979 --> 00:09:57,175
Well, hello to you, Billy Drayton.
How'd you hold up in the storm?

171
00:09:57,275 --> 00:10:01,263
We had a tree come through the picture window
last night, right in my studio.

172
00:10:01,363 --> 00:10:05,142
And the boathouse got all smooshed.
Mr. Norton's tree fell on it.

173
00:10:05,242 --> 00:10:06,601
Yeah.

174
00:10:06,701 --> 00:10:09,287
Sorry to hear that.

175
00:10:10,831 --> 00:10:12,149
How'd you guys make out?

176
00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:15,402
Oh, we're fine.
It's the listings I'm worried about.

177
00:10:15,502 --> 00:10:18,280
At the very least, I'll bet every one
of our "For Sale" signs fell over.

178
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,032
We had damage
at the school, wouldn't you know?

179
00:10:21,132 --> 00:10:24,077
That's what we get for not fixing
that roof when we should've,

180
00:10:24,177 --> 00:10:27,581
but with funds being cut every year...

181
00:10:27,681 --> 00:10:31,752
You'd think educating children
would be more of a priority in this country,

182
00:10:31,852 --> 00:10:33,670
but you'd be wrong.

183
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,923
Government's got better things
to spend our money on,

184
00:10:37,023 --> 00:10:40,652
like corporate handouts
and building bombs.

185
00:10:54,249 --> 00:10:55,984
Daddy, is there a fire?
ls Mommy all right?

186
00:10:56,084 --> 00:10:58,628
I'm sure she's fine.
Don't worry, okay?

187
00:10:59,713 --> 00:11:01,172
Mind what you're doing, Sally.

188
00:11:02,173 --> 00:11:03,784
Oh, come on,
we got 10 days' leave.

189
00:11:03,884 --> 00:11:04,910
Check our papers.

190
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,912
Look, I told you,
all leaves are cancelled.

191
00:11:07,012 --> 00:11:08,038
I don't know why.

192
00:11:08,138 --> 00:11:10,040
I gotta go check the pharmacy out.

193
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,542
Three men meet me
back at the Jeep in five minutes.

194
00:11:12,642 --> 00:11:13,894
That's an order.

195
00:11:16,229 --> 00:11:19,733
Shit, man! Another half an hour,
and we'd have been gone.

196
00:11:52,974 --> 00:11:54,517
Oh, my God!

197
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:04,219
Something in the mist!

198
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:07,681
Something in the mist took John Lee!

199
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:09,099
Dan, catch your breath.

200
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:11,059
Something in the mist took John Lee.

201
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:12,894
I could hear him screaming.

202
00:12:12,994 --> 00:12:15,897
Shut the doors! Shut the doors!
My God!

203
00:12:15,997 --> 00:12:17,624
Daddy, I'm scared.
Can we go home?

204
00:12:22,087 --> 00:12:23,113
Don't go out there.

205
00:12:23,213 --> 00:12:25,407
There's something in the mist.
It took John Lee.

206
00:12:25,507 --> 00:12:27,993
Screw that!
I'm gettin' in my car.

207
00:12:28,093 --> 00:12:29,552
Mister, no!

208
00:12:52,492 --> 00:12:53,743
Oh, shit.

209
00:13:01,876 --> 00:13:03,320
Please hold me.

210
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,405
It's okay, it's okay.

211
00:13:05,505 --> 00:13:09,576
It's a pollution cloud.
The mills down in Rumford.

212
00:13:09,676 --> 00:13:12,804
Some kind of chemical explosion.
Has to be.

213
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,682
What is it?

214
00:13:16,891 --> 00:13:18,393
What's going on?

215
00:13:21,563 --> 00:13:22,772
It's death.

216
00:13:57,557 --> 00:13:59,934
Stay down!

217
00:14:01,144 --> 00:14:02,312
Daddy!

218
00:14:09,069 --> 00:14:11,279
You all right? You okay?

219
00:14:21,498 --> 00:14:22,999
That was an earthquake.

220
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,277
I tell you, the goddamn mills blew up!

221
00:14:26,377 --> 00:14:29,823
Is everyone okay?
Is anyone hurt?

222
00:14:29,923 --> 00:14:33,201
Everybody just stay put, okay?
Just stay inside the store.

223
00:14:33,301 --> 00:14:36,121
I can't. I can't stay here.
I gotta get home to my kids.

224
00:14:36,221 --> 00:14:39,290
No.
No, don't go out there.

225
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:42,168
It's death out there.
It's the end of days.

226
00:14:42,268 --> 00:14:44,254
Stop it, okay? Stop it.

227
00:14:44,354 --> 00:14:47,173
Please, everybody,
everybody just relax, okay?

228
00:14:47,273 --> 00:14:49,217
He's right. Let's just stay cool.

229
00:14:49,317 --> 00:14:50,677
Let's just try to figure out
what happened.

230
00:14:50,777 --> 00:14:55,140
I'm sorry, I-- I can't just stay here.
I have to get home to my kids.

231
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,100
Ma'am, no, you can't go out there.

232
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,893
Could be a poisonous gas cloud.

233
00:14:58,993 --> 00:15:00,437
Didn't you hear that man screaming?

234
00:15:00,537 --> 00:15:03,189
I agree. Let's stay here
until we figure it out.

235
00:15:03,289 --> 00:15:04,624
You're not listening!

236
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,918
I can't stay here.

237
00:15:08,044 --> 00:15:11,865
Wanda's looking after little Victor.
She's only eight.

238
00:15:11,965 --> 00:15:16,261
Sometimes she forgets
she's supposed to be watching him.

239
00:15:19,931 --> 00:15:22,183
I told them I'd only be gone
a few minutes.

240
00:15:23,393 --> 00:15:25,645
She's only eight.

241
00:15:26,729 --> 00:15:29,566
For their sakes, don't.

242
00:15:34,737 --> 00:15:37,282
Well, isn't anybody gonna help me?

243
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:41,744
It's okay, pal.

244
00:15:42,912 --> 00:15:45,456
Won't somebody here see a lady home?

245
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,629
You?

246
00:15:59,262 --> 00:16:00,305
You?

247
00:16:09,856 --> 00:16:12,008
- It's okay, buddy.
- You?

248
00:16:12,108 --> 00:16:15,403
Ma'am, please,
I got my own boy to worry about.

249
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:22,018
I hope you all rot in hell.

250
00:16:22,118 --> 00:16:24,329
Ma'am, please, wait until--

251
00:16:59,447 --> 00:17:01,975
Okay,
let's start cleaning up, okay?

252
00:17:02,075 --> 00:17:04,686
Get the spilled bottles,
broken glass, stuff like that.

253
00:17:04,786 --> 00:17:07,438
Aisle three has medical supplies.

254
00:17:07,538 --> 00:17:10,316
It's okay. It's okay.

255
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,026
All right, easy, champ.
Come on.

256
00:17:12,126 --> 00:17:13,153
Come on.

257
00:17:13,253 --> 00:17:15,905
Come on.
All right, hey, hey, hey.

258
00:17:16,005 --> 00:17:17,657
Can't keep crying like this, pal.

259
00:17:17,757 --> 00:17:19,033
Come on!

260
00:17:19,133 --> 00:17:21,119
Come on, you're gonna hurt yourself.

261
00:17:21,219 --> 00:17:23,496
- Come on, are you all right?
- I want Mommy!

262
00:17:23,596 --> 00:17:25,081
All right, I know you want Mommy.

263
00:17:25,181 --> 00:17:27,625
All right, just try to breathe.

264
00:17:27,725 --> 00:17:29,018
Just try to breathe, okay?

265
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:32,338
Just try to breathe, pal.
That's okay.

266
00:17:32,438 --> 00:17:34,107
It's all right.

267
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:39,804
I haven't seen him suck his thumb
like this since he was two years old.

268
00:17:39,904 --> 00:17:41,681
He's in shock.

269
00:17:41,781 --> 00:17:43,474
I think we all are.

270
00:17:43,574 --> 00:17:45,268
You haven't met.

271
00:17:45,368 --> 00:17:46,811
Amanda Dunfrey.

272
00:17:46,911 --> 00:17:49,080
She's new in town
as of this semester.

273
00:17:50,081 --> 00:17:51,524
Teaches third grade

274
00:17:51,624 --> 00:17:54,903
and the special ed kids,
now that Mosher's retired.

275
00:17:55,003 --> 00:17:56,921
She's wonderful.
The kids love her.

276
00:17:57,922 --> 00:18:00,033
And David's an artist.

277
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:03,036
He does movie posters and such.

278
00:18:03,136 --> 00:18:04,178
And me...

279
00:18:04,846 --> 00:18:09,626
Lord, I'm babbling away
like some old biddy at a tea party!

280
00:18:09,726 --> 00:18:11,211
My nerves are jangled, I guess.

281
00:18:11,311 --> 00:18:12,503
Boy settle down?

282
00:18:12,603 --> 00:18:14,047
How is he?

283
00:18:14,147 --> 00:18:15,215
Still hot.

284
00:18:15,315 --> 00:18:17,008
Why don't I get him some aspirin.

285
00:18:17,108 --> 00:18:18,718
- Aisle three.
- Okay.

286
00:18:18,818 --> 00:18:20,303
Thanks.

287
00:18:20,403 --> 00:18:21,888
How's Dan?

288
00:18:21,988 --> 00:18:23,765
His nose stopped bleedin'.

289
00:18:23,865 --> 00:18:26,200
He's calmer now.
Somebody gave him a Valium.

290
00:18:27,869 --> 00:18:31,522
Can't believe the way he ran in here.
Never seen him like that.

291
00:18:31,622 --> 00:18:35,610
I need something to cover my boy up.
Got any blankets?

292
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,820
Furniture pads. Loadin' dock.

293
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,949
Gonna keep checkin' on people.
If you need anything, just holler.

294
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:43,117
You bet. Sally, you mind?

295
00:18:43,217 --> 00:18:45,536
Oh, I'd love to. I really should
help him clean up.

296
00:18:45,636 --> 00:18:47,997
- I'll take him.
- Okay.

297
00:18:48,097 --> 00:18:49,123
Daddy, don't go.

298
00:18:49,223 --> 00:18:52,293
No, I'll be gone two seconds, Big Bill.
Come on, I'm gonna get your blanket.

299
00:18:52,393 --> 00:18:54,254
Mrs. Reppler's here,

300
00:18:54,354 --> 00:18:56,356
and so is Mrs. Turman.

301
00:18:57,398 --> 00:18:58,883
I'll be close by, okay?

302
00:18:58,983 --> 00:19:01,569
- Okay.
- Don't worry, I'm not far. Okay?

303
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:03,654
Let me look at you.

304
00:19:09,285 --> 00:19:10,311
Wanna lie down?

305
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:11,454
Yeah.

306
00:19:12,538 --> 00:19:13,773
There you go.

307
00:19:13,873 --> 00:19:17,485
Soon as it blows away,
we can walk out of here safe and free,

308
00:19:17,585 --> 00:19:18,987
but we have to be smart about it.

309
00:19:19,087 --> 00:19:21,739
First thing we need to do
is keep our wits about us

310
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:23,199
and find out what's happened.

311
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:24,951
Well, how we gonna
do that, my man?

312
00:19:25,051 --> 00:19:27,620
We've got no phone signal,
got no radio.

313
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,248
I'm sure they're working
on those problems as we speak.

314
00:19:30,348 --> 00:19:32,500
It stands to reason
that restoring communications

315
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,720
would be their top priority.

316
00:19:46,531 --> 00:19:48,574
Jeez!

317
00:20:08,094 --> 00:20:10,263
Oh, shit.

318
00:20:15,226 --> 00:20:16,269
Shit!

319
00:20:20,606 --> 00:20:21,732
God damn it!

320
00:20:25,445 --> 00:20:27,013
Bitch!

321
00:20:27,113 --> 00:20:28,222
It's obvious that we're--

322
00:20:28,322 --> 00:20:30,308
we're in some kind
of natural disaster here.

323
00:20:30,408 --> 00:20:33,019
Ain't nothin' obvious
about this sombitch from where I sit.

324
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:35,355
There ain't nothin'
natural about it either.

325
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,481
That's right.

326
00:20:36,581 --> 00:20:39,192
It's Judgment Day,
and it's come round at last.

327
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:41,778
There is nothing more obvious
or natural than that.

328
00:20:41,878 --> 00:20:43,363
Fuck, now.

329
00:20:43,463 --> 00:20:47,091
You've done that to yourself
by a life of sin and dissolution.

330
00:21:33,429 --> 00:21:35,081
Hey, David!

331
00:21:35,181 --> 00:21:37,500
Hey, you guys hear that?

332
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,460
The generator?
We're just gonna check it out.

333
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,421
No, no, I turned the generator off.

334
00:21:41,521 --> 00:21:43,523
It-- it was backing up.

335
00:21:45,107 --> 00:21:47,527
- N-nobody else heard that sound?
- What sound?

336
00:21:48,528 --> 00:21:52,181
I don't know, like a... weird noise,

337
00:21:52,281 --> 00:21:54,016
back there in the dark.

338
00:21:54,116 --> 00:21:56,602
Like something was, like,
pressing against the door.

339
00:21:56,702 --> 00:22:00,189
Did you hear it
before the lights went out, or after?

340
00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:02,108
No, only after.

341
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,444
After, but, look, I heard it, okay?

342
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,612
- Nobody's calling you a liar.
- That's what it sounds like.

343
00:22:06,712 --> 00:22:09,323
No, no, no, no.
Now, don't be thattaway, Mr. Drayton.

344
00:22:09,423 --> 00:22:11,492
You had a scare, no doubt.

345
00:22:11,592 --> 00:22:14,011
What say we all go check it out? Here.

346
00:22:22,687 --> 00:22:23,713
Man.

347
00:22:23,813 --> 00:22:25,882
It's pretty rank in here.

348
00:22:25,982 --> 00:22:28,109
- Myron, go check it out.
- All right.

349
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,363
Go on, fire it up.

350
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:43,357
All right!

351
00:22:43,457 --> 00:22:44,542
Shut it off!

352
00:22:45,585 --> 00:22:47,336
Holy crow, don't that stink!

353
00:22:48,337 --> 00:22:51,365
Something's got
the exhaust vent plugged up from the outside.

354
00:22:51,465 --> 00:22:53,826
You get it running long enough
to raise that door a little,

355
00:22:53,926 --> 00:22:55,411
I'll go out and clear
whatever's blockin' it.

356
00:22:55,511 --> 00:22:56,662
No, no, you can't do that.

357
00:22:56,762 --> 00:22:58,706
Why not?
It's an electric door, right?

358
00:22:58,806 --> 00:23:01,792
Well, yeah, but it may not be wise
to send him out there.

359
00:23:01,892 --> 00:23:03,169
Okay, I'll do it.

360
00:23:03,269 --> 00:23:05,171
No, look, it's not about
who goes out there.

361
00:23:05,271 --> 00:23:07,215
What, don't you think I can do it?

362
00:23:07,315 --> 00:23:09,926
Hey! I want to go!
It was my idea.

363
00:23:10,026 --> 00:23:11,511
Well, wait, just stop, okay?

364
00:23:11,611 --> 00:23:13,179
J-Jim, right?

365
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:15,723
Myron? You guys are--

366
00:23:15,823 --> 00:23:17,892
you, well, you don't seem
to understand,

367
00:23:17,992 --> 00:23:19,602
or you're tryin' real hard not to.

368
00:23:19,702 --> 00:23:21,270
This is no ordinary mist, okay?

369
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:24,524
You open that door,
and something gets in here.

370
00:23:24,624 --> 00:23:25,875
Like what?

371
00:23:27,043 --> 00:23:28,945
Well, like whatever
made that noise I heard.

372
00:23:29,045 --> 00:23:30,530
Are you guys being willfully dense?

373
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,907
Mr. Drayton, you'll pardon me,

374
00:23:33,007 --> 00:23:36,661
but I'm not convinced
that you heard anything.

375
00:23:36,761 --> 00:23:39,805
I mean, we're not hearing
anything now, right? Anybody?

376
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:43,251
See?

377
00:23:43,351 --> 00:23:46,337
Now, I know, I know--
you're a big shot artist

378
00:23:46,437 --> 00:23:48,881
with connections in New York
and Hollywood and all like that,

379
00:23:48,981 --> 00:23:51,259
but that don't make you better
than anybody else, not in my book.

380
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:52,718
Hey, I didn't say that.

381
00:23:52,818 --> 00:23:55,096
Nor do I like being
talked down to or called stupid

382
00:23:55,196 --> 00:23:58,140
by a guy who went to college,
just 'cause he's got the jitters.

383
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,393
Fellas, it doesn't even matter
about the generator.

384
00:24:00,493 --> 00:24:01,811
The food'll keep without it.

385
00:24:01,911 --> 00:24:04,322
Kid, I'm gonna start the motor,
you raise the door...

386
00:24:04,423 --> 00:24:06,315
and you yell out when
you got enough room.

387
00:24:06,415 --> 00:24:07,942
Yeah. Okay, good.

388
00:24:08,042 --> 00:24:09,777
Wait.

389
00:24:09,877 --> 00:24:12,863
This is-- you guys gonna let
this kid risk his life

390
00:24:12,963 --> 00:24:14,615
over a generator
that doesn't even matter?

391
00:24:14,715 --> 00:24:16,075
Would you just
shut the fuck up already?

392
00:24:16,175 --> 00:24:17,201
Norm!

393
00:24:17,301 --> 00:24:19,245
Listen, Mr. Drayton,
I tell you what.

394
00:24:19,345 --> 00:24:22,748
The next time you got somethin' to say,
you count your teeth,

395
00:24:22,848 --> 00:24:26,127
because I'm sick to death
of your bullshit.

396
00:24:26,227 --> 00:24:28,671
All right? Come on, Myron.

397
00:24:28,771 --> 00:24:30,506
- This is crazy!
- Leave 'em be.

398
00:24:30,606 --> 00:24:32,566
What am I, impugning
their manhood or something?

399
00:24:33,234 --> 00:24:35,094
Listen, they've lost
their sense of proportion.

400
00:24:35,194 --> 00:24:36,512
What's going on here?

401
00:24:36,612 --> 00:24:38,431
Out there in the market,
they were scared and confused.

402
00:24:38,531 --> 00:24:40,433
In here, there's a problem
they can solve,

403
00:24:40,533 --> 00:24:42,518
so they're goddamn gonna solve it.

404
00:24:42,618 --> 00:24:44,103
- Ready, kid?
- Let's rock.

405
00:24:44,203 --> 00:24:45,521
Norm, come on.

406
00:24:45,621 --> 00:24:46,664
Don't, man.

407
00:24:51,001 --> 00:24:52,169
It's a mistake.

408
00:24:56,757 --> 00:24:57,925
Pussy.

409
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,556
Go up!

410
00:25:25,745 --> 00:25:26,854
So...

411
00:25:26,954 --> 00:25:28,414
Any Boogeymen?

412
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:32,818
Pretty scary, ain't it, Norm?

413
00:25:32,918 --> 00:25:34,962
Yeah, right.

414
00:25:38,215 --> 00:25:39,258
Norm.

415
00:25:40,384 --> 00:25:41,952
Norm!

416
00:25:42,052 --> 00:25:43,329
What the fuck!

417
00:25:43,429 --> 00:25:44,955
Get it off! Get it off!

418
00:25:45,055 --> 00:25:46,916
Get this friggin' thing off me!

419
00:25:47,016 --> 00:25:48,834
Get it off! Help me!

420
00:25:48,934 --> 00:25:50,586
Help me! Help me!

421
00:25:52,229 --> 00:25:53,397
Jesus!

422
00:26:03,866 --> 00:26:06,852
There's more! There's more!

423
00:26:06,952 --> 00:26:08,871
Somebody help me.

424
00:26:09,872 --> 00:26:12,358
Somebody help me.

425
00:26:12,458 --> 00:26:14,126
What the fuck are you waitin' for?

426
00:26:26,555 --> 00:26:27,932
Hang on!

427
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:40,820
Hold him still!
Hold him still!

428
00:26:48,828 --> 00:26:50,830
Oh, Jesus!

429
00:27:24,196 --> 00:27:25,848
Shit! Oh, shit!

430
00:27:25,948 --> 00:27:28,033
Oh, shit!

431
00:27:29,827 --> 00:27:31,996
David, it's no good!

432
00:27:33,205 --> 00:27:34,607
Start the generator.

433
00:28:43,817 --> 00:28:45,152
Hey, I'm sorry.

434
00:28:48,155 --> 00:28:51,450
I mean, how the-- how the hell
was I supposed to know what you meant?

435
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:54,453
You said you heard something.

436
00:28:55,788 --> 00:28:57,273
How was I supposed to know
what you meant?

437
00:28:57,373 --> 00:28:58,566
You should've said
what you meant better.

438
00:28:58,666 --> 00:29:01,710
I don't know, I thought maybe
it was a big bird or some--

439
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,572
You got that kid killed!

440
00:29:04,672 --> 00:29:06,615
Did you get a good look at it? Huh?

441
00:29:06,715 --> 00:29:09,827
Did you get a good look
at what you did?

442
00:29:09,927 --> 00:29:11,120
- Huh?
- David!

443
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,538
Don't hit him any more!
Doesn't solve anything!

444
00:29:12,638 --> 00:29:15,374
You two assholes,
you got that kid killed!

445
00:29:15,474 --> 00:29:17,476
And I got his fuckin' blood on me!

446
00:29:37,329 --> 00:29:39,373
Okay, I'm done.

447
00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:42,501
Okay.

448
00:29:46,088 --> 00:29:49,133
- What's next?
- Kill the generator.

449
00:29:50,134 --> 00:29:51,385
That's the first thing.

450
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,557
I'm sorry.

451
00:30:01,228 --> 00:30:03,297
Jesus Christ! Oh, God!

452
00:30:03,397 --> 00:30:05,983
I'm-- I'm sorry about the kid.

453
00:30:08,027 --> 00:30:10,195
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

454
00:30:11,572 --> 00:30:12,948
We oughta get out of here.

455
00:30:17,369 --> 00:30:18,646
Hey, we didn't twist his arm.

456
00:30:18,746 --> 00:30:22,041
Yeah, he's a fuckin' kid.
He's supposed to be stupid.

457
00:30:23,042 --> 00:30:24,918
What's your excuse, huh?

458
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,465
Get outta here.

459
00:30:30,549 --> 00:30:32,468
Go back in the market.
Stay by the door.

460
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,680
Don't say anything, to anybody.

461
00:30:38,223 --> 00:30:39,266
Not yet.

462
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:41,852
Not yet.

463
00:30:56,825 --> 00:30:58,268
Shit.

464
00:30:58,368 --> 00:31:01,205
David? Need a little light here.

465
00:31:12,007 --> 00:31:13,784
We have to tell 'em.

466
00:31:13,884 --> 00:31:16,762
The people in the market,
we have to stop 'em going outside.

467
00:31:18,013 --> 00:31:19,348
They won't believe us.

468
00:31:20,641 --> 00:31:21,667
They have to.

469
00:31:21,767 --> 00:31:23,977
I'm not sure I believe it.
I was here.

470
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,089
W-what we saw was impossible.

471
00:31:27,189 --> 00:31:29,049
You know that, don't you?

472
00:31:29,149 --> 00:31:30,192
I mean, what--

473
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,195
what do we say?

474
00:31:34,196 --> 00:31:36,865
How do we convince them?

475
00:31:39,868 --> 00:31:43,872
Ollie, what the hell were
those tentacles even attached to?

476
00:31:49,711 --> 00:31:51,822
Oh, my God!
Are-- are you all right?

477
00:31:51,922 --> 00:31:54,533
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's not my blood. I'm fine.

478
00:31:54,633 --> 00:31:55,993
W-what the hell happened?

479
00:31:56,093 --> 00:31:59,972
I'll explain. Give me a minute, okay?
I need to deal with something first.

480
00:32:01,849 --> 00:32:03,459
Please, I've got to--

481
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:06,211
I can't let Billy see me like this.
He's scared enough.

482
00:32:06,311 --> 00:32:09,214
Just give me a minute.
Keep him distracted. Okay?

483
00:32:09,314 --> 00:32:10,357
Okay.

484
00:32:15,988 --> 00:32:18,891
Hey, look, I'm sorry about Norm.

485
00:32:18,991 --> 00:32:20,392
Me too.

486
00:32:20,492 --> 00:32:22,811
I mean, I ain't makin' excuses,
I'm just sayin'.

487
00:32:22,911 --> 00:32:24,188
Look, we need to tell people.

488
00:32:24,288 --> 00:32:26,732
No need to say how it went down
or anything like that,

489
00:32:26,832 --> 00:32:29,568
but, we're in the deep shit here.

490
00:32:29,668 --> 00:32:31,153
People need to know.

491
00:32:31,253 --> 00:32:32,738
What about the out-of-towners?

492
00:32:32,838 --> 00:32:35,574
We got plenty of them in the store.
Where do we even start?

493
00:32:35,674 --> 00:32:37,910
- Brent Norton?
- That windbag?

494
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:40,704
He's an important attorney in New York.

495
00:32:40,804 --> 00:32:42,915
That fellow could be
on the bench one day.

496
00:32:43,015 --> 00:32:45,501
Counts a lot with people of this town,
or-- or anywhere.

497
00:32:45,601 --> 00:32:47,127
- Yeah, that's right.
- Do it quick, David.

498
00:32:47,227 --> 00:32:50,089
We've got to discuss how we're gonna
stop that thing getting in here.

499
00:32:50,189 --> 00:32:51,982
W-wait. What do you mean getting in?

500
00:32:52,691 --> 00:32:54,176
You shut the loading door.

501
00:32:54,276 --> 00:32:57,696
Yeah, but the entire front of the store
is plate glass.

502
00:33:01,575 --> 00:33:03,535
Jesus Christ.

503
00:33:14,129 --> 00:33:15,906
I was wondering
where you'd gotten to.

504
00:33:16,006 --> 00:33:17,449
Um, listen...

505
00:33:17,549 --> 00:33:20,344
that guy that came in here,
the one with the bloody nose...

506
00:33:25,849 --> 00:33:29,336
...they're-- they're--
We saw tentacles.

507
00:33:29,436 --> 00:33:32,731
Ain't goin' very well, is it?

508
00:33:34,358 --> 00:33:35,984
- You... what?
- Come here, you've got--

509
00:33:37,194 --> 00:33:38,403
Come here.

510
00:33:40,405 --> 00:33:41,448
Tell him.

511
00:33:43,575 --> 00:33:44,618
It's true.

512
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:53,752
Tentacles. Yeah.

513
00:34:02,928 --> 00:34:04,429
Um, gentlemen,

514
00:34:05,639 --> 00:34:08,208
I'm sorry, I--
I'm just not that stupid.

515
00:34:08,308 --> 00:34:11,520
I mean, what do you take me for?
I'm shocked.

516
00:34:12,521 --> 00:34:13,547
I'm shocked.

517
00:34:13,647 --> 00:34:14,486
I'm shocked.

518
00:34:14,587 --> 00:34:17,901
It's pretty tasteless using what's happening
here to try to make me look like an idiot.

519
00:34:18,001 --> 00:34:19,511
No, no, that's not
what's going on here.

520
00:34:19,611 --> 00:34:21,555
Look, come back
to the loading dock, okay?

521
00:34:21,655 --> 00:34:22,681
I'll show you.

522
00:34:22,781 --> 00:34:26,268
Blood. A chunk of tentacle
on-- on the floor.

523
00:34:26,368 --> 00:34:27,394
No.

524
00:34:27,494 --> 00:34:29,188
No? What do you mean no?

525
00:34:29,288 --> 00:34:31,523
No. We've got real problems
to deal with here,

526
00:34:31,623 --> 00:34:36,653
and this pathetic attempt at a joke
has gone far enough.

527
00:34:36,753 --> 00:34:39,698
Mr. Norton, what reason
could we possibly have--?

528
00:34:39,798 --> 00:34:41,408
Oh, please! Please!

529
00:34:41,508 --> 00:34:43,952
This is payback for the lawsuit
that I filed against him last year,

530
00:34:44,052 --> 00:34:45,871
and you guys are backing him up.

531
00:34:45,971 --> 00:34:47,581
So winning wasn't enough, huh?

532
00:34:47,681 --> 00:34:49,875
You wanted to humiliate me some more,

533
00:34:49,975 --> 00:34:52,294
show me a rubber snake
while these-- these hicks

534
00:34:52,394 --> 00:34:53,670
stand around laughing their asses off.

535
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:55,672
- Watch who you callin' a hick!
- Myron! Myron!

536
00:34:55,772 --> 00:34:57,466
- Hey, hey, fuck--!
- Mr. Norton, I swear,

537
00:34:57,566 --> 00:34:59,635
you have got us all wrong.

538
00:34:59,735 --> 00:35:04,239
You're not too crazy about,
um, out-of-towners, are you?

539
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,267
I only spend my money,
and I pay my taxes here,

540
00:35:07,367 --> 00:35:11,246
and I have seen you
talking behind my back.

541
00:35:12,789 --> 00:35:14,291
Y'all stick together.

542
00:35:17,461 --> 00:35:19,071
Well, don't I feel foolish?

543
00:35:19,171 --> 00:35:21,615
I actually thought you were
being kind to me today,

544
00:35:21,715 --> 00:35:23,200
and, well, thanks
for setting me straight.

545
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,410
And I'm glad that tree fell
on your boathouse, you know that?

546
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,913
Glad. Smashed it in
pretty good, didn't it? Fantastic.

547
00:35:28,013 --> 00:35:29,581
Now, all of y'all,
just stay out of my way.

548
00:35:29,681 --> 00:35:32,209
I know you're scared, man.
I'm scared too.

549
00:35:32,309 --> 00:35:34,336
- Lives are at stake around here.
- David--

550
00:35:34,436 --> 00:35:36,755
Okay, my son's life.
Now, I need you.

551
00:35:36,855 --> 00:35:40,384
Brent, please, get your head out of your ass.

552
00:35:40,484 --> 00:35:43,637
All right, I'll drag you back there
if I have to. Come here.

553
00:35:43,737 --> 00:35:46,640
David, get-- get your goddamn hands off of me!

554
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,684
I'll sue your ass again!

555
00:35:48,784 --> 00:35:51,019
Sue your ass, and this time
you'll go to jail!

556
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,604
This man assaulted me.

557
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:55,232
He assaulted me.
You were witness to it.

558
00:35:55,332 --> 00:35:56,358
This man's crazy.
He's crazy.

559
00:35:56,458 --> 00:35:58,026
No.

560
00:35:58,126 --> 00:36:00,545
He isn't. I wish he was, but he isn't.

561
00:36:02,756 --> 00:36:06,885
E-everyone in the store,
you want to come back here?

562
00:36:07,928 --> 00:36:10,580
There's something you need to hear.
It concerns you all.

563
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,915
Okay.

564
00:36:12,015 --> 00:36:14,960
W-w-wait. I don't know
what you people think you're doing.

565
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,586
You're drinking?

566
00:36:16,686 --> 00:36:18,146
For Christ's sake, Ollie.

567
00:36:19,147 --> 00:36:22,217
Do you want me to report you?
You want to lose your job?

568
00:36:22,317 --> 00:36:24,219
Look, I'm gonna be taking down names,
starting with you.

569
00:36:24,319 --> 00:36:26,263
And I am prepared to file
a police report.

570
00:36:26,363 --> 00:36:28,307
- Fine, Bud, write down your names.
- I will.

571
00:36:28,407 --> 00:36:31,243
But in the meantime,
shut the fuck up and listen.

572
00:36:33,078 --> 00:36:34,229
This is Mr. David Drayton.

573
00:36:34,329 --> 00:36:37,649
You need to hear what he's got to say
if you're thinking about leaving.

574
00:36:37,749 --> 00:36:39,359
...go hang out
with the ladies, all right?

575
00:36:39,459 --> 00:36:40,794
Listen, don't be scared.

576
00:36:42,963 --> 00:36:44,005
It's okay.

577
00:36:46,174 --> 00:36:47,217
Okay.

578
00:36:48,343 --> 00:36:49,661
This is how it is.

579
00:36:49,761 --> 00:36:52,180
Now, I don't know
what this mist is...

580
00:36:53,181 --> 00:36:55,375
but there are things in it,
and they're dangerous, like Dan said.

581
00:36:55,475 --> 00:36:56,518
That's right.

582
00:36:57,144 --> 00:36:58,879
That's exactly right.

583
00:36:58,979 --> 00:37:00,839
What kind of things?

584
00:37:00,939 --> 00:37:02,841
I never saw it.
It happened too fast.

585
00:37:02,941 --> 00:37:04,760
I got knocked down.

586
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:07,012
Five of us went back
in the loading dock.

587
00:37:07,112 --> 00:37:10,682
It was Jim, Myron, Ollie...

588
00:37:10,782 --> 00:37:12,351
me...

589
00:37:12,451 --> 00:37:13,977
Norm, the bagboy.

590
00:37:14,077 --> 00:37:15,520
- We opened the door...
- Where's Norm?

591
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:19,332
...So Norm could go out
and clear the vent for the generator.

592
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,652
Something come out of the mist
and took him.

593
00:37:22,752 --> 00:37:25,046
- Took him?
- What do you mean?

594
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,741
Just... killed him.

595
00:37:27,841 --> 00:37:29,701
I mean dragged him off.

596
00:37:29,801 --> 00:37:34,347
Now, guys, I don't know
what these things are.

597
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:36,892
All we saw were tentacles.

598
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:41,813
Tentacles?

599
00:37:44,983 --> 00:37:46,610
Tentacles, he says.

600
00:37:47,235 --> 00:37:49,221
Tentacles from Planet X.

601
00:37:49,321 --> 00:37:50,639
It's a lie, you know.

602
00:37:50,739 --> 00:37:53,892
I mean, all these people do
is just lie each other up.

603
00:37:53,992 --> 00:37:55,143
It's a pile of shit.

604
00:37:55,243 --> 00:37:58,480
Of course it's a lie.
Of course it's a lie. It's lunacy.

605
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:01,400
From the look of it, the tentacles
are coming out of the beer cans.

606
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,294
All right, Bud,
don't take our word for it. Go look.

607
00:38:10,926 --> 00:38:11,968
Over there.

608
00:38:17,641 --> 00:38:19,142
What the hell is that?

609
00:38:51,591 --> 00:38:54,928
It appears we may have a problem
of some magnitude here.

610
00:39:11,027 --> 00:39:12,737
Yeah, just keep 'em in line. Thanks.

611
00:39:23,623 --> 00:39:25,292
Let me...

612
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:30,822
help these people.

613
00:39:30,922 --> 00:39:32,699
Let me--

614
00:39:32,799 --> 00:39:34,801
let me preach Your word.

615
00:39:36,803 --> 00:39:39,206
Let me shine Your light,

616
00:39:39,306 --> 00:39:41,808
'cause they're not all bad.

617
00:39:42,809 --> 00:39:45,145
They can't all be bad.

618
00:39:48,148 --> 00:39:52,052
Some can be saved, can't they?

619
00:39:52,152 --> 00:39:53,887
Yes.

620
00:39:53,987 --> 00:39:55,614
Some can be brought...

621
00:39:56,615 --> 00:39:59,726
to heaven's holy gates
through Your grace.

622
00:39:59,826 --> 00:40:01,019
I have to believe that,

623
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:05,540
though I know most will swim
in the lake of fire forever.

624
00:40:09,169 --> 00:40:10,837
If I can save a few...

625
00:40:12,172 --> 00:40:14,174
even one...

626
00:40:15,175 --> 00:40:17,677
then my life will have counted
for something.

627
00:40:18,678 --> 00:40:21,498
I will have pulled my weight.

628
00:40:21,598 --> 00:40:24,960
I will have earned my place at Your side.

629
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:29,297
I will have served a purpose
here on this earth.

630
00:40:29,397 --> 00:40:30,398
Hello?

631
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,316
What?

632
00:40:48,416 --> 00:40:50,627
I just need to use the bathroom.

633
00:40:52,879 --> 00:40:55,298
Okay. Well, then, have at it.

634
00:40:59,594 --> 00:41:00,845
Ma'am...

635
00:41:01,888 --> 00:41:05,750
I-- I just want you to know
that it's okay--

636
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:07,460
being scared, I mean--

637
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,088
and, well, if you need a friend--

638
00:41:10,188 --> 00:41:12,591
you know, someone to talk to.

639
00:41:12,691 --> 00:41:14,676
I have a friend--

640
00:41:14,776 --> 00:41:18,638
God up above.
I talk to Him every day.

641
00:41:18,738 --> 00:41:20,724
Don't you condescend to me.

642
00:41:20,824 --> 00:41:21,933
I'm sorry?

643
00:41:22,033 --> 00:41:25,562
Not ever.
You don't mock me.

644
00:41:25,662 --> 00:41:27,247
That's not what I was doing.

645
00:41:28,289 --> 00:41:30,233
Well, I'll tell you what--

646
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:32,319
the day I need a friend like you,

647
00:41:32,419 --> 00:41:36,339
I'll just have myself a little squat
and shit one out.

648
00:41:41,177 --> 00:41:42,787
Maybe you do believe this.

649
00:41:42,887 --> 00:41:45,957
Maybe they're not lies,
they're delusions. Whatever.

650
00:41:46,057 --> 00:41:49,252
The fact remains,
the evidence here is flimsy.

651
00:41:49,352 --> 00:41:52,088
- It's bordering on ludicrous.
- Hey, this isn't a courtroom.

652
00:41:52,188 --> 00:41:55,008
You're not arguing a case, and you're doing
nothing but damage, talking the way you are.

653
00:41:55,108 --> 00:41:58,136
And you can throw as much cow's blood
around the loading dock as you want to.

654
00:41:58,236 --> 00:42:00,597
- You still haven't fooled anyone.
- Leave it alone, David.

655
00:42:00,697 --> 00:42:02,474
You can't convince
some people there's a fire

656
00:42:02,574 --> 00:42:04,517
even when their hair is burning.

657
00:42:04,617 --> 00:42:06,102
Denial is a powerful thing.

658
00:42:06,202 --> 00:42:07,228
Well, keep talking.

659
00:42:07,328 --> 00:42:10,565
I'll have no part of it,
nor would any thinking person.

660
00:42:10,665 --> 00:42:13,318
Keep thinking, Mr. Lawyer.

661
00:42:13,418 --> 00:42:16,363
There's no defense
against the will of God.

662
00:42:16,463 --> 00:42:18,657
There's no court of appeals in hell.

663
00:42:18,757 --> 00:42:21,076
There's no defense here, either.

664
00:42:21,176 --> 00:42:25,955
Not even with all the fertilizer in the world,
not even if you stack it as high as you can.

665
00:42:26,055 --> 00:42:28,375
It's still just bags of shit, isn't it?

666
00:42:28,475 --> 00:42:30,752
Those of you who want to discuss
this thing rationally

667
00:42:30,852 --> 00:42:34,714
to find a means of rescue
are welcome to join me.

668
00:42:34,814 --> 00:42:37,509
Those who want to stack dog food...

669
00:42:37,609 --> 00:42:39,235
knock yourselves out.

670
00:42:42,864 --> 00:42:45,183
We got those windows taped up
as best we could.

671
00:42:45,283 --> 00:42:46,393
It should help.

672
00:42:46,493 --> 00:42:47,827
Yeah, think so?

673
00:42:49,871 --> 00:42:51,706
Duct tape and dog food bags.

674
00:42:53,917 --> 00:42:55,235
That bad?

675
00:42:55,335 --> 00:42:56,361
It's not good.

676
00:42:56,461 --> 00:42:59,547
There's none so blind
as those who will not see.

677
00:43:00,799 --> 00:43:02,367
Open your eyes.

678
00:43:02,467 --> 00:43:04,703
Let the scales fall away.

679
00:43:04,803 --> 00:43:06,805
This has all been written.

680
00:43:08,306 --> 00:43:11,668
Revelations, chapter 15:

681
00:43:11,768 --> 00:43:14,045
"And the temple was filled with smoke

682
00:43:14,145 --> 00:43:16,297
"from the glory of God

683
00:43:16,397 --> 00:43:17,716
"and from His power,

684
00:43:17,816 --> 00:43:19,759
"and no one could enter the temple

685
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:23,388
until the seven plagues
of the seven angels were completed."

686
00:43:23,488 --> 00:43:25,765
Well, what are you saying?

687
00:43:25,865 --> 00:43:27,183
What are you proposing?

688
00:43:27,283 --> 00:43:28,827
That we all prepare...

689
00:43:30,328 --> 00:43:31,730
to meet our Maker.

690
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:33,998
Oh, prepare to meet shit!

691
00:43:34,999 --> 00:43:37,527
Lady, your tongue
must be hung in the middle

692
00:43:37,627 --> 00:43:39,487
so that it can waggle at both ends.

693
00:43:39,587 --> 00:43:41,322
The end time has come,

694
00:43:41,422 --> 00:43:43,116
not in flames, but in mist.

695
00:43:43,216 --> 00:43:44,242
Come here!

696
00:43:44,342 --> 00:43:45,452
Easy! Back off!

697
00:43:45,552 --> 00:43:48,913
How about if your ass prepares
to meet my size-10 work boot.

698
00:43:49,013 --> 00:43:51,458
- How about that?
- Hey, there's no call for that.

699
00:43:51,558 --> 00:43:53,793
Myron, please,
calm your friend down.

700
00:43:53,893 --> 00:43:56,671
I'm trying
to save your soul, you stupid man.

701
00:43:56,771 --> 00:43:58,965
- Doubters will doubt till the end.
- It's okay.

702
00:43:59,065 --> 00:44:00,091
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

703
00:44:00,191 --> 00:44:02,777
A monstrosity did pull
that poor boy away.

704
00:44:03,403 --> 00:44:06,681
Things in the mist--
do you doubt?

705
00:44:06,781 --> 00:44:07,824
Do you?

706
00:44:09,325 --> 00:44:11,227
Then go out.

707
00:44:11,327 --> 00:44:13,688
Go out and say,
"How do you do."

708
00:44:13,788 --> 00:44:14,831
Shut up, lady.

709
00:44:16,499 --> 00:44:17,650
For God's sakes.

710
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:19,903
Look, you'll have to stop now.
You're scaring the children.

711
00:44:20,003 --> 00:44:21,404
They should be scared.

712
00:44:21,504 --> 00:44:24,173
Oh, yes, they should.

713
00:44:25,174 --> 00:44:27,660
Their beautiful, pure little minds

714
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,163
have been corrupted with lies.

715
00:44:30,263 --> 00:44:31,289
Lies.

716
00:44:31,389 --> 00:44:33,458
All this talk of a modern God,

717
00:44:33,558 --> 00:44:36,252
or no God.

718
00:44:36,352 --> 00:44:38,004
There is one God.

719
00:44:38,104 --> 00:44:39,714
The God of the Israelites.

720
00:44:39,814 --> 00:44:42,634
And He is a stern and vengeful God,

721
00:44:42,734 --> 00:44:45,261
and we have been mocking Him
far too long,

722
00:44:45,361 --> 00:44:48,973
and now He demands
retribution in blood.

723
00:44:49,073 --> 00:44:51,726
It is time to declare yourselves.

724
00:44:51,826 --> 00:44:53,478
Take sides--

725
00:44:53,578 --> 00:44:55,355
the saved and the damned.

726
00:44:55,455 --> 00:44:58,942
Read the Good Book.
It calls for expiation.

727
00:44:59,042 --> 00:45:00,902
- Blood!
- What?

728
00:45:01,002 --> 00:45:02,045
Blood.

729
00:45:03,129 --> 00:45:04,781
Little Normie was first,

730
00:45:04,881 --> 00:45:07,909
and now God calls the rest of us.

731
00:45:08,009 --> 00:45:09,494
The bill is due.

732
00:45:09,594 --> 00:45:11,037
It must be paid.

733
00:45:11,137 --> 00:45:14,123
As Abraham prepared
to sacrifice his only son

734
00:45:14,223 --> 00:45:16,084
to prove his love for God, so--

735
00:45:16,184 --> 00:45:17,602
Enough.

736
00:45:23,149 --> 00:45:25,635
Another down payment.

737
00:45:25,735 --> 00:45:27,637
A few more pennies in the jar.

738
00:45:27,737 --> 00:45:30,223
Now, that's nice, see.
I can't smack her, but it's okay for you.

739
00:45:30,323 --> 00:45:31,599
I-I'm sorry everybody,

740
00:45:31,699 --> 00:45:34,686
but this lady's perspective is
a little too Old Testament for my taste.

741
00:45:34,786 --> 00:45:36,287
They'll come for you.

742
00:45:37,288 --> 00:45:39,791
Maybe tonight,
when darkness comes.

743
00:45:41,334 --> 00:45:44,195
They'll come tonight,
and they'll take someone else.

744
00:45:44,295 --> 00:45:46,281
See if they don't.

745
00:45:46,381 --> 00:45:48,116
And when they do,

746
00:45:48,216 --> 00:45:50,785
you will cry to God,

747
00:45:50,885 --> 00:45:54,539
and you will beg Mother Carmody
to show you the way.

748
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:55,974
That's fine.

749
00:45:57,016 --> 00:45:59,252
But until then,
if you don't shut up,

750
00:45:59,352 --> 00:46:01,337
I'll wrap this tape around your mouth.

751
00:46:01,437 --> 00:46:03,715
You just try it, Ollie Weeks.

752
00:46:03,815 --> 00:46:05,316
And you, bitch...

753
00:46:06,818 --> 00:46:08,319
you hit me again...

754
00:46:09,362 --> 00:46:11,389
if you dare.

755
00:46:11,489 --> 00:46:14,158
You'll be on your knees to me
before this is through.

756
00:46:20,873 --> 00:46:25,586
Those of you who aren't local should know
that Mrs. Carmody is known in town for being...

757
00:46:26,671 --> 00:46:27,864
unstable.

758
00:46:27,964 --> 00:46:31,134
No shit.
What was your first clue?

759
00:46:36,764 --> 00:46:39,667
- Hi.
- What's up, little dude?

760
00:46:39,767 --> 00:46:41,586
How come your friends
don't come get us?

761
00:46:41,686 --> 00:46:43,229
They got tanks and stuff, right?

762
00:46:44,689 --> 00:46:46,090
Why can't you just call 'em?

763
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:47,258
Phones don't work.

764
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:49,135
But don't you got, like, a radio?

765
00:46:49,235 --> 00:46:50,678
Hey, champ, what's going on?

766
00:46:50,778 --> 00:46:52,931
I want their friends
to come rescue us.

767
00:46:53,031 --> 00:46:55,141
They would if they could, pal.
They're stuck here just like us.

768
00:46:55,241 --> 00:46:56,059
But--

769
00:46:56,159 --> 00:46:57,894
Now, guys, we could use
a hand over there.

770
00:46:57,994 --> 00:46:59,020
Yeah, sure thing.

771
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,813
Troop, off your asses.

772
00:47:00,913 --> 00:47:03,650
- You all right?
- I don't like that scary lady.

773
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:06,069
Oh, man, I don't either.

774
00:47:06,169 --> 00:47:07,628
But you know what?

775
00:47:08,629 --> 00:47:10,423
Maybe she's scared too.

776
00:47:11,466 --> 00:47:12,508
You think?

777
00:47:13,509 --> 00:47:14,969
You think Mommy's okay?

778
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:17,706
Billy...

779
00:47:21,225 --> 00:47:23,294
I'm sorry about the times
I was bad to her.

780
00:47:23,394 --> 00:47:24,437
Hey.

781
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,549
Mommy loves you very much.

782
00:47:28,649 --> 00:47:30,151
And I'll bet she's fine.

783
00:47:31,986 --> 00:47:33,972
And I promise you,

784
00:47:34,072 --> 00:47:37,241
I'm gonna do everything I can
to get us back to her.

785
00:47:38,826 --> 00:47:40,244
- Okay?
- 'Kay_

786
00:47:41,245 --> 00:47:42,705
- Yeah?
- 'Kay.

787
00:47:43,748 --> 00:47:47,777
So, we can use the charcoal fluid
and the mops to make torches.

788
00:47:47,877 --> 00:47:49,862
And we've got knives and stuff, God knows.

789
00:47:49,962 --> 00:47:55,176
This may be a silly question, Bud, but...
do you happen to have a gun in the store?

790
00:47:56,177 --> 00:47:57,996
Here? No. Please.

791
00:47:58,096 --> 00:47:59,831
This-- this isn't Los Angeles.

792
00:47:59,931 --> 00:48:01,557
I've got a shotgun in my truck.

793
00:48:02,934 --> 00:48:04,335
I could try for it if you want.

794
00:48:04,435 --> 00:48:06,713
Oh, God, I don't think that'd be
a good idea, Mr. Cornell.

795
00:48:06,813 --> 00:48:07,855
Hold on.

796
00:48:10,274 --> 00:48:11,759
This gun,

797
00:48:11,859 --> 00:48:13,678
my husband's idea.

798
00:48:13,778 --> 00:48:15,763
He's away on business a lot.

799
00:48:15,863 --> 00:48:17,015
It's not even loaded.

800
00:48:17,115 --> 00:48:18,741
Ain't much use unloaded, ma'am.

801
00:48:23,454 --> 00:48:24,981
You know how to use that?

802
00:48:25,081 --> 00:48:28,818
Well, I shot it once on a pistol range.
Hit the target a few times.

803
00:48:28,918 --> 00:48:31,696
So, we got a gun.

804
00:48:31,796 --> 00:48:33,698
Anybody know how to shoot it?

805
00:48:33,798 --> 00:48:35,158
Well, I mean?

806
00:48:35,258 --> 00:48:36,300
I do.

807
00:48:39,053 --> 00:48:40,079
You?

808
00:48:40,179 --> 00:48:42,932
Ollie. Please.

809
00:48:48,312 --> 00:48:50,173
Some target shooting.

810
00:48:50,273 --> 00:48:52,425
State champion in '94.

811
00:48:52,525 --> 00:48:56,137
- You're crazy if you go out there!
- Let us pass! Let us pass, please!

812
00:48:56,237 --> 00:48:57,430
Let's just talk this thing through.

813
00:48:57,530 --> 00:48:59,766
We have, and we've
made our decision. We're leaving.

814
00:48:59,866 --> 00:49:02,769
Hey, Mr. Mackey's gonna barbecue
some chicken on the gas grill.

815
00:49:02,869 --> 00:49:05,146
- Why don't we just sit down and just--
- What, and let you keep on talking?

816
00:49:05,246 --> 00:49:07,356
No, I've been in far too many
courtrooms to fall for that.

817
00:49:07,456 --> 00:49:09,484
You've already psyched out
half a dozen of my people already.

818
00:49:09,584 --> 00:49:10,610
Your people?

819
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:12,487
What kind of talk is that?
They're people, that's all.

820
00:49:12,587 --> 00:49:14,030
Now-- now listen, everyone.

821
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:17,075
We are experiencing
some kind of disaster.

822
00:49:17,175 --> 00:49:19,118
I don't know whether
it's man-made or natural,

823
00:49:19,218 --> 00:49:23,081
but I do know that
it's definitely not supernatural

824
00:49:23,181 --> 00:49:25,500
or biblical,
and, no offense, Mrs. Carmody,

825
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,210
but the only way
we're gonna help ourselves

826
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:28,936
is to seek rescue.

827
00:49:30,771 --> 00:49:31,814
We're going out.

828
00:49:34,483 --> 00:49:36,511
- Brent, look.
- I'm not discussing this any further.

829
00:49:36,611 --> 00:49:38,779
I know. I just want to ask a favor.

830
00:49:40,489 --> 00:49:42,016
Tie this around your waist.

831
00:49:42,116 --> 00:49:43,184
What for?

832
00:49:43,284 --> 00:49:45,369
It'll let us know you got
at least 300 feet.

833
00:49:47,622 --> 00:49:48,664
I'll do it.

834
00:49:50,208 --> 00:49:53,736
- Are you throwing in with them?
- Me? No thanks.

835
00:49:53,836 --> 00:49:56,489
I think your man there
is a little too tightly wound.

836
00:49:56,589 --> 00:49:58,658
Gonna get somebody killed.

837
00:49:58,758 --> 00:50:01,536
But I'm thinkin' we could use
that shotgun of yours.

838
00:50:01,636 --> 00:50:04,288
I saw where you parked
when I pulled in.

839
00:50:04,388 --> 00:50:06,499
Red pickup, right?
Far entrance?

840
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:09,335
Son, you got brass balls.

841
00:50:09,435 --> 00:50:11,337
The shells are
in the glove compartment.

842
00:50:11,437 --> 00:50:12,688
Drive it back.

843
00:50:14,857 --> 00:50:16,092
All right.

844
00:50:16,192 --> 00:50:17,844
Just see they're paying out this line.

845
00:50:17,944 --> 00:50:20,138
Line's up, I'll cut her loose,

846
00:50:20,238 --> 00:50:21,597
just so you understand.

847
00:50:21,697 --> 00:50:22,740
Yeah.

848
00:50:30,373 --> 00:50:32,692
You sure there's no way
I can talk you out of this?

849
00:50:32,792 --> 00:50:38,072
David... there's nothing out there.
Nothing in the mist.

850
00:50:38,172 --> 00:50:40,091
What if you're wrong?

851
00:50:41,175 --> 00:50:42,677
Then, I guess...

852
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,723
the joke would be on me after all.

853
00:50:53,062 --> 00:50:54,272
We're gonna send back help.

854
00:50:55,398 --> 00:50:57,733
You'll die out there.
All of you.

855
00:51:10,496 --> 00:51:13,691
Hey, crazy lady,
I believe in God too.

856
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:17,737
I just don't think He's the bloodthirsty
asshole you make Him out to be.

857
00:51:17,837 --> 00:51:20,448
Well, you take that up with the devil
when you run into him.

858
00:51:20,548 --> 00:51:22,174
You just chat it over at your leisure.

859
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:32,810
Well, let's strike out
toward the center of town.

860
00:51:51,996 --> 00:51:53,247
Keep it loose.

861
00:52:09,055 --> 00:52:10,539
Nice and easy.

862
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:11,891
Keep going.

863
00:52:29,492 --> 00:52:30,534
Look.

864
00:52:33,704 --> 00:52:34,997
It's going.

865
00:52:37,041 --> 00:52:38,209
They're doing good.

866
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:57,520
Put it down!

867
00:52:58,562 --> 00:53:00,356
Pull!

868
00:53:02,733 --> 00:53:05,152
Oh, my God!
I'm slippin'!

869
00:53:06,654 --> 00:53:08,989
Pull! Back up! Back up!
Back up!

870
00:53:22,378 --> 00:53:23,421
Get it off!

871
00:53:32,805 --> 00:53:33,848
Oh, my God.

872
00:53:40,521 --> 00:53:41,981
- Sh--
- Blood!

873
00:53:43,858 --> 00:53:45,526
Oh, my God!

874
00:53:46,735 --> 00:53:49,029
Oh, my God!

875
00:54:03,544 --> 00:54:04,837
Cut the rope!

876
00:54:07,631 --> 00:54:08,549
Shut the door!

877
00:54:14,305 --> 00:54:16,307
Now do you see?

878
00:54:18,309 --> 00:54:19,810
Now do you believe?

879
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,155
About a half-hour of daylight left.

880
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:34,308
Guys, how's it going
with these work lights?

881
00:54:34,408 --> 00:54:37,937
- We're gettin' 'em rigged up all right.
- Yeah, check it out.

882
00:54:38,037 --> 00:54:39,955
All right, all right.
Save it, save it.

883
00:54:40,956 --> 00:54:42,483
These batteries ain't topped up.

884
00:54:42,583 --> 00:54:44,652
You turn the lights on,
it's gonna drain 'em quick.

885
00:54:44,752 --> 00:54:45,861
How quick?

886
00:54:45,961 --> 00:54:47,905
- Five minutes, maybe ten.
- Yeah, if that.

887
00:54:48,005 --> 00:54:50,007
Okay, emergencies only.

888
00:54:51,008 --> 00:54:52,510
If something gets in the store.

889
00:55:00,267 --> 00:55:02,795
Holy Jesus,
you scared the shit outta me.

890
00:55:02,895 --> 00:55:04,438
Oh, Sally, I'm sorry, really.

891
00:55:05,981 --> 00:55:08,801
I thought I'd come in and say hi
and see how you were holding up.

892
00:55:08,901 --> 00:55:10,361
- Hi.
- Hi.

893
00:55:11,487 --> 00:55:12,763
Barely. How about you?

894
00:55:12,863 --> 00:55:14,432
I'm worried about my folks, I guess.

895
00:55:14,532 --> 00:55:17,184
You know, they live
up on Shorm Road.

896
00:55:17,284 --> 00:55:19,353
That's less than
five miles from here.

897
00:55:19,453 --> 00:55:20,980
How 'bout yours?

898
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,665
Well, they're out of town right now.

899
00:55:23,666 --> 00:55:26,235
They're at my aunt's in Boston, so...

900
00:55:26,335 --> 00:55:29,071
That's lucky.
That means they're okay.

901
00:55:29,171 --> 00:55:30,422
I hope so.

902
00:55:32,633 --> 00:55:36,245
So... how soon you shipping out?

903
00:55:36,345 --> 00:55:38,013
Couple weeks.

904
00:55:39,682 --> 00:55:41,183
Scared about going over there?

905
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,602
Yeah.

906
00:55:48,857 --> 00:55:50,401
' Hey' Wayne?

907
00:55:51,527 --> 00:55:53,554
How come you never asked me out?

908
00:55:53,654 --> 00:55:56,532
We flirted all through high school.
I know you like me.

909
00:56:00,828 --> 00:56:02,371
So how come?

910
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:06,625
I'm stupid, I guess.

911
00:56:23,142 --> 00:56:25,336
Oh, shit! I'm sorry.

912
00:56:25,436 --> 00:56:29,715
Don't be. I just-- I just didn't really want it
to happen like this, you know?

913
00:56:29,815 --> 00:56:32,468
Some shitty locker room at work.

914
00:56:32,568 --> 00:56:34,737
Can we just stay in here a while, then?

915
00:56:36,155 --> 00:56:38,532
I mean, just-- just you and me.

916
00:56:49,835 --> 00:56:53,489
- The parking lot lamps turned on.
- They're on a timer.

917
00:56:53,589 --> 00:56:55,533
Must be a different municipal line.

918
00:56:55,633 --> 00:56:58,327
Maybe we could
tie into them somehow,

919
00:56:58,427 --> 00:57:00,304
get some electricity in here.

920
00:57:01,305 --> 00:57:02,973
That'd mean walking out the door.

921
00:57:13,984 --> 00:57:15,736
God!

922
00:57:16,612 --> 00:57:18,013
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

923
00:57:18,113 --> 00:57:20,115
David! David!

924
00:57:22,409 --> 00:57:23,435
<i>...you sure?</i>

925
00:57:23,535 --> 00:57:24,578
Look!

926
00:57:47,685 --> 00:57:49,144
My God.

927
00:58:04,201 --> 00:58:06,161
Are those bugs?

928
00:58:08,372 --> 00:58:10,482
Not like any I've ever seen.

929
00:58:10,582 --> 00:58:12,693
<i>"They came out of the smoke,</i>

930
00:58:12,793 --> 00:58:14,695
<i>"locusts upon the earth,</i>

931
00:58:14,795 --> 00:58:17,281
"and unto them was given power

932
00:58:17,381 --> 00:58:21,535
even as the scorpions
of the earth have power."

933
00:58:24,221 --> 00:58:26,682
Look at those stingers.

934
00:58:30,144 --> 00:58:32,146
Dear God.

935
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:12,811
Holy shit!

936
00:59:28,243 --> 00:59:30,204
Myron, get the ones in the back!

937
00:59:31,747 --> 00:59:33,440
God, I think they're attracted to the light.

938
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:35,859
Look out, look out, look out!

939
00:59:35,959 --> 00:59:37,039
The light! Douse the light!

940
00:59:38,712 --> 00:59:40,047
Look out! Look out!

941
00:59:44,843 --> 00:59:46,094
Move! Move!

942
00:59:48,096 --> 00:59:50,557
Light, light,
light, light, light!

943
00:59:51,767 --> 00:59:53,544
"And there came a voice
from the temple

944
00:59:53,644 --> 00:59:55,421
"saying to the seven angels,

945
00:59:55,521 --> 00:59:57,840
"'Go your ways

946
00:59:57,940 --> 01:00:02,110
and pour out the vials
of the wrath of God upon the earth.'"

947
01:00:10,994 --> 01:00:13,497
Ollie, the glass is gonna give!

948
01:00:21,296 --> 01:00:23,907
- Shit!
- Oh, my God, they turned on all the lights!

949
01:00:24,007 --> 01:00:25,451
- Jim! Myron!
- Fire!

950
01:00:25,551 --> 01:00:27,453
- Douse the lights!
- Fire! Lighter!

951
01:00:27,553 --> 01:00:29,805
Come on, come on!

952
01:00:41,316 --> 01:00:42,818
Sally, look out!

953
01:00:45,153 --> 01:00:46,180
No!

954
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:56,565
Let me see, let me see.
Let me see, sweetheart, let me see.

955
01:00:56,665 --> 01:00:58,609
No, you're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

956
01:00:58,709 --> 01:00:59,735
Let me see. Let me see.

957
01:00:59,835 --> 01:01:01,445
You're fine. You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

958
01:01:01,545 --> 01:01:02,780
Give me the lighter!
Put it on fire!

959
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:03,922
Come on!

960
01:01:07,217 --> 01:01:10,370
Come on, come on!
Breathe, breathe, breathe, Sally!

961
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:13,056
Goddamn childproofing sons of bitches!

962
01:01:15,183 --> 01:01:17,394
Oh, shoot it! Shoot it!

963
01:01:19,021 --> 01:01:20,714
Shoot it! Shoot it!

964
01:01:20,814 --> 01:01:22,382
I can't! I'll smash the window!

965
01:01:22,482 --> 01:01:24,635
God!

966
01:01:24,735 --> 01:01:26,361
Oh, God!

967
01:01:27,863 --> 01:01:29,615
Go! Go!

968
01:01:31,992 --> 01:01:33,827
Get down!

969
01:01:40,167 --> 01:01:41,668
Shit!

970
01:01:51,386 --> 01:01:53,667
- Ollie, you want these lights on or off?
- Leave 'em on.

971
01:01:59,645 --> 01:02:00,671
Oh, God!

972
01:02:00,771 --> 01:02:03,065
Kill it!

973
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,101
Bring torches!
Bring something to keep 'em out!

974
01:02:14,201 --> 01:02:15,243
Come on.

975
01:02:17,204 --> 01:02:18,330
Sally!

976
01:02:30,258 --> 01:02:32,469
Where are the goddamn extinguishers?

977
01:02:36,932 --> 01:02:38,392
What's happening?!

978
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:44,523
Get it! Get it! Get it!

979
01:02:49,945 --> 01:02:52,890
Bring torches.
We need torches at the window!

980
01:02:52,990 --> 01:02:54,533
Plug that hole!

981
01:03:01,707 --> 01:03:02,749
Dad!

982
01:03:08,672 --> 01:03:10,340
Down! Down! Lay down!

983
01:03:26,898 --> 01:03:27,941
My life...

984
01:03:29,026 --> 01:03:32,446
my life for You,
Your will be done.

985
01:03:45,792 --> 01:03:47,903
Daddy!

986
01:03:48,003 --> 01:03:50,297
Bugs! Daddy!

987
01:04:05,562 --> 01:04:07,965
- No! Billy!
- Daddy!

988
01:04:08,065 --> 01:04:10,025
' Billy!
' Daddy!

989
01:04:23,038 --> 01:04:24,523
Billy!

990
01:04:24,623 --> 01:04:25,732
Dad!

991
01:04:25,832 --> 01:04:27,334
Billy, come back here.

992
01:04:29,044 --> 01:04:31,046
- Dad!
- Billy, please!

993
01:04:36,968 --> 01:04:38,261
Billy!

994
01:05:07,207 --> 01:05:08,483
Come on, let's move it!

995
01:05:08,583 --> 01:05:10,527
Somebody please
come over here and help.

996
01:05:10,627 --> 01:05:12,295
Here's some tape!

997
01:05:14,631 --> 01:05:16,758
I'm right here.
I'm right here. Don't worry.

998
01:05:17,801 --> 01:05:19,703
Hurry up with the blankets!

999
01:05:19,803 --> 01:05:22,806
It hurts so bad! Please!

1000
01:05:30,647 --> 01:05:32,174
It hurts so bad!

1001
01:05:32,274 --> 01:05:34,134
Block it up here.

1002
01:05:34,234 --> 01:05:36,319
Get me some more bags!

1003
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:39,990
Did we get 'em?
Did we get 'em all?

1004
01:05:40,991 --> 01:05:42,684
She was right.

1005
01:05:42,784 --> 01:05:45,062
She said that it would happen like this.

1006
01:05:45,162 --> 01:05:47,164
She said that
they would come at night.

1007
01:05:48,331 --> 01:05:50,167
She told us someone would die.

1008
01:06:14,191 --> 01:06:15,901
Mommy.

1009
01:06:17,485 --> 01:06:19,487
It's okay.

1010
01:06:20,614 --> 01:06:22,240
It's okay, it was just a dream.

1011
01:06:23,241 --> 01:06:24,618
It's just a bad dream.

1012
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:27,395
I want my mommy.

1013
01:06:27,495 --> 01:06:29,064
I know.

1014
01:06:29,164 --> 01:06:31,399
I know. Of course you do.

1015
01:06:31,499 --> 01:06:34,027
I wanna go home.

1016
01:06:34,127 --> 01:06:35,629
Just sleep.

1017
01:06:37,005 --> 01:06:38,673
Everything'll be better in the morning.

1018
01:06:45,347 --> 01:06:46,848
Think he likes you.

1019
01:06:49,392 --> 01:06:51,978
Well, I hate that
I had to lie to him.

1020
01:06:53,021 --> 01:06:54,464
You have kids?

1021
01:06:54,564 --> 01:06:55,799
No.

1022
01:06:55,899 --> 01:06:58,026
I always wanted to, but...

1023
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:00,779
things haven't been working out.

1024
01:07:03,114 --> 01:07:06,117
Right now I'm thinking
maybe that's for the best.

1025
01:07:07,285 --> 01:07:11,022
I saw creatures
fly into the store tonight that--

1026
01:07:11,122 --> 01:07:12,832
they shouldn't exist.

1027
01:07:14,292 --> 01:07:16,878
I keep thinking I'm gonna
wake up in a rubber room.

1028
01:07:18,296 --> 01:07:19,547
You're not alone in that.

1029
01:07:20,590 --> 01:07:22,050
We're all right there with you.

1030
01:07:23,176 --> 01:07:24,928
This isn't gonna end, is it?

1031
01:07:27,931 --> 01:07:28,974
David.

1032
01:07:30,016 --> 01:07:32,269
It's Joe. He's getting worse.

1033
01:07:50,161 --> 01:07:52,122
Joe.

1034
01:07:53,999 --> 01:07:55,734
How you holdin' up, partner?

1035
01:07:55,834 --> 01:07:59,170
David... is that you?

1036
01:08:00,297 --> 01:08:01,798
Yeah, pal, how you doin'?

1037
01:08:02,799 --> 01:08:05,535
It's bad. He's bad.

1038
01:08:05,635 --> 01:08:08,263
Didn't know anything
could hurt like this.

1039
01:08:09,264 --> 01:08:11,599
If you guys can't help me...

1040
01:08:12,809 --> 01:08:15,103
you-- you gotta end it, okay?

1041
01:08:17,314 --> 01:08:19,649
Ollie's got that gun, right?

1042
01:08:21,151 --> 01:08:23,678
- Right?
- No. No way.

1043
01:08:23,778 --> 01:08:26,056
You can't fuck with me on this, bro.

1044
01:08:26,156 --> 01:08:28,308
Not with me like this.

1045
01:08:28,408 --> 01:08:29,851
I'll do it.

1046
01:08:29,951 --> 01:08:32,687
Just give me the gun.

1047
01:08:32,787 --> 01:08:34,397
Hey, hey.

1048
01:08:34,497 --> 01:08:37,567
- We're not there yet, okay?
- Oh, please!

1049
01:08:37,667 --> 01:08:39,419
Joe, now, listen.

1050
01:08:40,462 --> 01:08:43,615
Pal... we're gonna work something out.

1051
01:08:43,715 --> 01:08:46,551
I just need you to hang in
a little longer, okay? Can we do that?

1052
01:08:50,472 --> 01:08:52,182
Stay with him.
I'll be back.

1053
01:08:55,477 --> 01:08:59,481
Hattie, I need to go to the bathroom.
Will you watch Billy?

1054
01:09:01,399 --> 01:09:02,442
Hattie.

1055
01:09:19,084 --> 01:09:20,335
See anything?

1056
01:09:21,544 --> 01:09:24,447
The last of those bugs
went away about four.

1057
01:09:24,547 --> 01:09:27,701
Dawn's coming.
What's on your mind?

1058
01:09:27,801 --> 01:09:29,052
It's Joe.

1059
01:09:30,762 --> 01:09:33,873
We don't get him on some serious antibiotics,
he's gonna die of infection.

1060
01:09:33,973 --> 01:09:36,251
Plus he needs
painkillers in the worst way.

1061
01:09:36,351 --> 01:09:40,130
All-- all-- all we got here
is liquor and aspirin.

1062
01:09:40,230 --> 01:09:42,966
You-- you thinkin' about goin'
to that pharmacy next door?

1063
01:09:43,066 --> 01:09:44,968
Irene Reppler says
they've got Silvadene--

1064
01:09:45,068 --> 01:09:46,845
you know, the stuff
they use in burn wards.

1065
01:09:46,945 --> 01:09:49,055
- She knows where they keep it.
- Slow down.

1066
01:09:49,155 --> 01:09:50,807
You can't actually be thinkin' of doin' this.

1067
01:09:50,907 --> 01:09:52,809
I'm also thinkin' beyond that.

1068
01:09:52,909 --> 01:09:54,577
We have to get out of here.

1069
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:59,024
- I mean permanently.
- Why? We got plenty to eat!

1070
01:09:59,124 --> 01:10:02,110
And what happens when one of those things
decides to break through this window?

1071
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:04,946
I'm talkin' one of the big ones,
like the one that killed Norm.

1072
01:10:05,046 --> 01:10:07,949
Yeah, and that flaming torch idea
didn't work so well, did it?

1073
01:10:08,049 --> 01:10:10,093
We almost burned
the goddamn store down.

1074
01:10:16,349 --> 01:10:17,684
It's Hattie.

1075
01:10:24,441 --> 01:10:25,508
Here?

1076
01:10:25,608 --> 01:10:27,594
All right,
gently, now. Gently.

1077
01:10:27,694 --> 01:10:29,988
One... two... three.

1078
01:10:39,539 --> 01:10:41,775
I don't know
how long she was there like that,

1079
01:10:41,875 --> 01:10:43,151
lying there next to us.

1080
01:10:43,251 --> 01:10:44,919
I thought she was sleeping.

1081
01:10:46,337 --> 01:10:48,114
I got my four-wheel drive.

1082
01:10:48,214 --> 01:10:49,783
It's out there.

1083
01:10:49,883 --> 01:10:51,551
Y-you're talking about leaving?

1084
01:10:52,886 --> 01:10:54,371
Well, we...

1085
01:10:54,471 --> 01:10:56,289
should hit the pharmacy first.

1086
01:10:56,389 --> 01:10:57,832
We gotta bring back
supplies for the injured.

1087
01:10:57,932 --> 01:10:59,209
I mean, if we don't,

1088
01:10:59,309 --> 01:11:02,045
Joe Eagleton's gonna die,
and we can't let that happen.

1089
01:11:02,145 --> 01:11:03,313
But after that...

1090
01:11:04,314 --> 01:11:05,965
look, my Land Cruiser
can hold eight people.

1091
01:11:06,065 --> 01:11:08,301
I say we drive south
as far as the fuel takes us

1092
01:11:08,401 --> 01:11:10,553
and try to get clear of this mist.

1093
01:11:10,653 --> 01:11:12,680
That's it?

1094
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:14,057
That's the plan?

1095
01:11:14,157 --> 01:11:16,101
- That's what I got.
- No, you can't mean it.

1096
01:11:16,201 --> 01:11:18,186
Not after what happened
to Norton and his group.

1097
01:11:18,286 --> 01:11:20,647
No, no, no. Amanda, think.

1098
01:11:20,747 --> 01:11:22,690
Norton got over 200 feet
from this store.

1099
01:11:22,790 --> 01:11:24,234
That's how much rope played out.

1100
01:11:24,334 --> 01:11:26,861
I'm parked half that distance from here.

1101
01:11:26,961 --> 01:11:28,905
But who knows how far
this mist has spread?

1102
01:11:29,005 --> 01:11:30,490
It could be the entire eastern seaboard.

1103
01:11:30,590 --> 01:11:32,742
Yeah, it could be the whole world,
for all we know.

1104
01:11:32,842 --> 01:11:36,079
Wouldn't make us any less dead,
now, would it?

1105
01:11:36,179 --> 01:11:38,039
We have one gun.

1106
01:11:38,139 --> 01:11:40,083
- How many rounds?
- We got ten left.

1107
01:11:40,183 --> 01:11:41,292
Ten rounds. Jesus.

1108
01:11:41,392 --> 01:11:43,019
Okay, so ten.

1109
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:46,005
Want another reason
to get the hell out of here?

1110
01:11:46,105 --> 01:11:49,067
I'll give you the best one. Her.

1111
01:11:50,193 --> 01:11:51,678
Mrs. Carmody.

1112
01:11:51,778 --> 01:11:54,597
She's our very own Jim Jones.

1113
01:11:54,697 --> 01:11:57,350
I'd like to leave before people
start drinking the Kool-Aid.

1114
01:11:57,450 --> 01:11:58,476
He's right.

1115
01:11:58,576 --> 01:12:00,812
Flakier people get,
the better she's gonna look.

1116
01:12:00,912 --> 01:12:03,565
No, I don't buy that.
It's obvious she's nuts.

1117
01:12:03,665 --> 01:12:05,108
Look, a few people maybe, but--

1118
01:12:05,208 --> 01:12:07,485
No, I count four.
She's preachin' to 'em right now.

1119
01:12:07,585 --> 01:12:09,070
By noon, she'll have four more.

1120
01:12:09,170 --> 01:12:11,281
By tomorrow night,
when those things come back,

1121
01:12:11,381 --> 01:12:12,866
she'll have a congregation,

1122
01:12:12,966 --> 01:12:16,453
and then we can start worryin'
about who she's gonna sacrifice

1123
01:12:16,553 --> 01:12:18,179
to make it all better.

1124
01:12:20,014 --> 01:12:21,916
You, Amanda?

1125
01:12:22,016 --> 01:12:23,293
My little boy?

1126
01:12:23,393 --> 01:12:24,919
He's right.

1127
01:12:25,019 --> 01:12:27,188
You don't have much faith
in humanity, do you?

1128
01:12:28,189 --> 01:12:29,591
None whatsoever.

1129
01:12:29,691 --> 01:12:31,134
I can't accept that.

1130
01:12:31,234 --> 01:12:33,928
People are basically good, decent.

1131
01:12:34,028 --> 01:12:36,097
My God, David, we're a civilized society.

1132
01:12:36,197 --> 01:12:39,184
Sure, as long as the machines
are workin' and you can dial 9-1-1,

1133
01:12:39,284 --> 01:12:42,061
but you take those things away,
you throw people in the dark,

1134
01:12:42,161 --> 01:12:44,105
you scare the shit out of them,

1135
01:12:44,205 --> 01:12:46,024
no more rules,

1136
01:12:46,124 --> 01:12:48,067
you'll see how primitive they get.

1137
01:12:48,167 --> 01:12:53,406
You scare people badly enough,
you can get 'em to do anything.

1138
01:12:53,506 --> 01:12:57,076
They'll turn to whoever
promises a solution,

1139
01:12:57,176 --> 01:12:58,369
or whatever.

1140
01:12:58,469 --> 01:13:00,455
Ollie, please, back me up here.

1141
01:13:00,555 --> 01:13:02,248
I wish I could.

1142
01:13:02,348 --> 01:13:04,642
As a species,
we're fundamentally insane.

1143
01:13:05,643 --> 01:13:07,293
Put more than
two of us in a room,

1144
01:13:07,394 --> 01:13:10,456
we pick sides and start
dreaming up reasons to kill one another.

1145
01:13:11,357 --> 01:13:14,010
Why do you think we invented
politics and religion?

1146
01:13:14,110 --> 01:13:17,805
Oh, Jesus, that's just... wrong.

1147
01:13:17,905 --> 01:13:20,391
Look, nobody has
to decide anything now, okay?

1148
01:13:20,491 --> 01:13:23,620
First things first-- the pharmacy.

1149
01:13:25,163 --> 01:13:26,814
That'll be our test run.

1150
01:13:26,914 --> 01:13:27,957
Okay?

1151
01:13:38,176 --> 01:13:39,911
It's all right, Big Bill.

1152
01:13:40,011 --> 01:13:41,663
I'm gonna bring you back
some comic books.

1153
01:13:41,763 --> 01:13:43,081
I don't want them.

1154
01:13:43,181 --> 01:13:44,791
I want you to stay here.

1155
01:13:44,891 --> 01:13:46,893
I won't be gone long.

1156
01:13:48,019 --> 01:13:49,921
Just-- just next door.

1157
01:13:50,021 --> 01:13:51,856
Hey, you'll be safe.

1158
01:13:53,399 --> 01:13:54,425
Daddy--

1159
01:13:54,525 --> 01:13:56,027
Daddy, there are things out there.

1160
01:13:57,028 --> 01:13:58,888
Things--

1161
01:13:58,988 --> 01:14:01,908
Yeah. There's a lot
less of 'em in the daytime.

1162
01:14:03,493 --> 01:14:06,396
They'll wait. They'll wait in the mist
where you can't see 'em,

1163
01:14:06,496 --> 01:14:08,731
and then when you go
and can't get back in...

1164
01:14:08,831 --> 01:14:10,275
they'll come and eat you up!

1165
01:14:10,375 --> 01:14:12,669
Daddy, don't go!

1166
01:14:22,011 --> 01:14:23,262
I'll be back.

1167
01:14:24,514 --> 01:14:27,083
Big Bill... I promise.

1168
01:14:27,183 --> 01:14:29,519
I'll be back, and then
I'm gonna take you home.

1169
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,088
All right?

1170
01:14:32,188 --> 01:14:34,232
Together, we're going home.

1171
01:14:35,233 --> 01:14:38,511
If something happens,
anything at all, you cut and run.

1172
01:14:38,611 --> 01:14:41,222
You get your ass back in here,
for your boy's sake.

1173
01:14:41,322 --> 01:14:43,825
If something happens to me,
I want you to take care of Billy...

1174
01:14:44,867 --> 01:14:47,854
best as you can,
as long as you can.

1175
01:14:47,954 --> 01:14:49,706
Land Cruiser's yours now.

1176
01:14:50,748 --> 01:14:52,317
You-- you get him out of here.

1177
01:14:52,417 --> 01:14:53,751
You just keep drivin'.

1178
01:15:00,341 --> 01:15:02,368
Where do you think you're going,
Mr. David Drayton?

1179
01:15:02,468 --> 01:15:05,413
Are you so anxious
to make your boy an orphan?

1180
01:15:05,513 --> 01:15:07,540
My boy is no concern of yours.

1181
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:08,916
Listen up.

1182
01:15:09,016 --> 01:15:10,960
We're going to the pharmacy.

1183
01:15:11,060 --> 01:15:13,004
We're gonna bring back some supplies.

1184
01:15:13,104 --> 01:15:16,466
Also, there may be people
trapped over there who need help.

1185
01:15:16,566 --> 01:15:18,718
Listen, folks, listen!

1186
01:15:18,818 --> 01:15:20,762
We're not gonna take any chances.

1187
01:15:20,862 --> 01:15:22,305
If there's any trouble,

1188
01:15:22,405 --> 01:15:24,390
we'll come straight back here
to the supermarket.

1189
01:15:24,490 --> 01:15:27,810
And bring the fiends of hell
down on our heads, thank you.

1190
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:29,354
She's right.

1191
01:15:29,454 --> 01:15:32,498
You'll make 'em notice us.
You'll make 'em come.

1192
01:15:33,499 --> 01:15:36,152
Why can't you just leave
well enough alone?

1193
01:15:36,252 --> 01:15:38,071
Lady, this what you call
"well enough"?

1194
01:15:38,171 --> 01:15:39,656
You wanna stop us?

1195
01:15:39,756 --> 01:15:41,240
You better explain to Bobby here

1196
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:43,534
why we're not bringin' painkillers
and medicine back for his brother.

1197
01:15:43,634 --> 01:15:45,787
I'm goin', even if I have to go alone.

1198
01:15:45,887 --> 01:15:47,538
You'll die out there, young man.

1199
01:15:47,638 --> 01:15:50,708
You'll walk out that door
and be torn to shreds,

1200
01:15:50,808 --> 01:15:54,003
and then your hell-bound pride
will have them come get the rest of us.

1201
01:15:54,103 --> 01:15:56,881
Yes, they'll come back for all of us,
just like this good lady said.

1202
01:15:56,981 --> 01:15:58,966
Do you want that
to happen, people?

1203
01:15:59,066 --> 01:16:02,220
- No!
- No! No! No!

1204
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,305
Well, it is this kind of hubris

1205
01:16:04,405 --> 01:16:06,849
that brought the wrath of God
in the first place.

1206
01:16:06,949 --> 01:16:08,576
This kind of pride and defiance of--

1207
01:16:10,411 --> 01:16:12,063
Shut up, you miserable buzzard!

1208
01:16:12,163 --> 01:16:13,398
You old bitch!

1209
01:16:13,498 --> 01:16:14,832
No, no, no, no!

1210
01:16:17,543 --> 01:16:20,655
Stoning people who piss you off
is perfectly okay.

1211
01:16:20,755 --> 01:16:22,365
They do it in the Bible, don't they?

1212
01:16:22,465 --> 01:16:24,242
And I got lots of peas.

1213
01:16:24,342 --> 01:16:26,953
David, please, if you want to go,
now's the time.

1214
01:16:27,053 --> 01:16:28,705
How 'bout it, Army?

1215
01:16:28,805 --> 01:16:30,289
Any help from the armed forces?

1216
01:16:30,389 --> 01:16:31,432
I'll go.

1217
01:16:33,851 --> 01:16:36,879
Jim Grondin.
I had you in school, didn't I?

1218
01:16:36,979 --> 01:16:38,923
Yes, ma’am, me and my sister Pauline.

1219
01:16:39,023 --> 01:16:40,633
Pair of underachievers.

1220
01:16:40,733 --> 01:16:41,984
After you, Jim.

1221
01:16:43,027 --> 01:16:44,387
Yes, ma'am.

1222
01:16:44,487 --> 01:16:45,805
Oh, shit.

1223
01:16:45,905 --> 01:16:48,266
That it?
That's everybody?

1224
01:16:48,366 --> 01:16:49,851
Everybody that's goin'.

1225
01:16:49,951 --> 01:16:51,978
- Yep.
- Okay.

1226
01:16:52,078 --> 01:16:55,064
Single file,
one by one, all right?

1227
01:16:55,164 --> 01:16:56,916
Let's get this thing over with.

1228
01:16:58,084 --> 01:16:59,152
Let's go.

1229
01:16:59,252 --> 01:17:00,962
- After you.
- Yes.

1230
01:17:03,965 --> 01:17:05,007
Stay together.

1231
01:17:08,135 --> 01:17:09,996
- Get the door.
- You know what?

1232
01:17:10,096 --> 01:17:11,581
- Mrs. Carmody, you're not helping.
- I don't care.

1233
01:17:11,681 --> 01:17:13,349
- Shut the hell up!
- You shut up!

1234
01:17:20,147 --> 01:17:21,482
Save the batteries.

1235
01:18:08,946 --> 01:18:10,515
Shit.

1236
01:18:10,615 --> 01:18:12,617
They left the doors propped open.

1237
01:18:13,951 --> 01:18:15,494
Think something got in?

1238
01:18:16,996 --> 01:18:21,484
Let's just... get what we need,
get the hell outta here.

1239
01:18:21,584 --> 01:18:22,985
Yeah. Let's do that.

1240
01:18:23,085 --> 01:18:27,506
The meds are
over at the end there, in the cubicle.

1241
01:18:47,985 --> 01:18:51,347
- Will you not do that?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1242
01:18:51,447 --> 01:18:53,449
Oh, God.

1243
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:19,417
Where's that Silvadene?

1244
01:19:19,517 --> 01:19:21,002
It's over behind David.

1245
01:19:21,102 --> 01:19:22,937
In the fridge. Check there.

1246
01:19:29,068 --> 01:19:30,528
Silvadene. Got it.

1247
01:19:31,070 --> 01:19:33,097
- Good.
- Ollie, what are we lookin' for?

1248
01:19:33,197 --> 01:19:34,682
- Penicillin.
- Yeah.

1249
01:19:34,782 --> 01:19:36,225
Any strong antibiotics.

1250
01:19:36,325 --> 01:19:37,977
Yeah.

1251
01:19:38,077 --> 01:19:41,480
Pain meds like Vicodin or Oxycontin.

1252
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:43,082
Oxycontin!

1253
01:19:44,834 --> 01:19:46,585
Hydrochloride?

1254
01:19:49,130 --> 01:19:50,172
Penicillin.

1255
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:02,393
Guys...

1256
01:20:06,230 --> 01:20:07,857
Hurry it up.
I hear something.

1257
01:20:11,736 --> 01:20:12,778
What?

1258
01:20:15,031 --> 01:20:16,574
Somethin' fuckin' weird.

1259
01:20:26,208 --> 01:20:28,002
Oh, God.

1260
01:20:28,210 --> 01:20:29,487
Oh, God!

1261
01:20:29,587 --> 01:20:31,932
No. Oh, no.

1262
01:20:33,632 --> 01:20:35,326
Oh, no.

1263
01:20:35,426 --> 01:20:37,011
Oh, fuck.

1264
01:20:38,888 --> 01:20:40,831
Look.
There's another one.

1265
01:20:40,931 --> 01:20:43,709
- Oh, my God.
- No, no, no.

1266
01:20:43,809 --> 01:20:46,145
Oh, no, no.

1267
01:20:46,771 --> 01:20:49,857
Guys, let's get out of here now.

1268
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:52,818
Holy shit!

1269
01:20:56,739 --> 01:20:58,992
Shit! Shit! Oh, shit!

1270
01:20:59,492 --> 01:21:03,154
I'm sorry!
Help me!

1271
01:21:03,954 --> 01:21:06,340
Good Lord!
Help him!

1272
01:21:11,837 --> 01:21:13,322
Son of a bitch!

1273
01:21:13,422 --> 01:21:14,965
This stuff ain't comin' off!

1274
01:21:16,050 --> 01:21:18,369
Oh, man!
He's glued to this fuckin' post!

1275
01:21:18,469 --> 01:21:20,246
It's our fault.

1276
01:21:20,346 --> 01:21:22,415
It's all our fault.

1277
01:21:22,515 --> 01:21:23,933
It's really stuck.

1278
01:21:28,270 --> 01:21:30,256
God, I can feel 'em!

1279
01:21:30,356 --> 01:21:32,399
I can feel 'em!

1280
01:21:34,026 --> 01:21:35,986
Oh, my God!
Jesus!

1281
01:21:43,119 --> 01:21:44,729
Oh, my God.

1282
01:21:44,829 --> 01:21:47,289
I--

1283
01:21:56,632 --> 01:21:58,551
There's more!

1284
01:22:07,184 --> 01:22:09,854
There's another one! Hit it!

1285
01:22:11,730 --> 01:22:14,008
What the hell is that stuff?

1286
01:22:14,108 --> 01:22:15,885
Ollie! One over there!

1287
01:22:15,985 --> 01:22:17,595
Ollie, there!

1288
01:22:17,695 --> 01:22:19,388
Got it!

1289
01:22:19,488 --> 01:22:21,932
There, there, there!
Shoot! Shoot!

1290
01:22:22,032 --> 01:22:23,893
Shit!

1291
01:22:23,993 --> 01:22:27,146
Where are they?
You see 'em?

1292
01:22:27,246 --> 01:22:30,274
Where the hell are they?

1293
01:22:30,374 --> 01:22:31,500
Bobby!

1294
01:22:31,709 --> 01:22:33,210
Bobby!

1295
01:22:38,424 --> 01:22:40,868
Hold on, man! Hold on!

1296
01:22:40,968 --> 01:22:42,620
- Hold on, man!
- Cut the strand!

1297
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:43,962
Help me!

1298
01:22:45,097 --> 01:22:46,807
Let's get out of here!

1299
01:22:48,851 --> 01:22:51,187
- A belt! Who's got a belt?
- I got a belt!

1300
01:22:52,813 --> 01:22:55,966
Hold it tight.

1301
01:22:56,066 --> 01:22:58,677
- I got him, I got him. Hold on.
- I can't feel my--

1302
01:22:58,777 --> 01:23:00,154
Pull it tight!

1303
01:23:01,697 --> 01:23:03,349
Look! Look!

1304
01:23:11,123 --> 01:23:12,650
Light!

1305
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:13,776
Light!

1306
01:23:13,876 --> 01:23:16,420
God!

1307
01:23:19,506 --> 01:23:22,701
We gotta get outta here!
Come on!

1308
01:23:22,801 --> 01:23:25,204
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go!

1309
01:23:25,304 --> 01:23:27,264
Watch it, watch it, watch it!

1310
01:23:38,609 --> 01:23:40,678
Let's get out of here!

1311
01:23:40,778 --> 01:23:44,056
All right, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Come on!

1312
01:23:44,156 --> 01:23:45,282
Come on!

1313
01:23:52,581 --> 01:23:55,209
Oh, my God! We can't go.

1314
01:23:56,210 --> 01:23:57,920
Ollie! Ollie!

1315
01:24:02,424 --> 01:24:04,260
Kill it! Kill it!

1316
01:24:14,937 --> 01:24:17,173
- Fuckers!
- Oh, no! Oh, God, he's dead!

1317
01:24:17,273 --> 01:24:19,842
He's dead! Get out of here!
Let's go, let's go!

1318
01:24:19,942 --> 01:24:22,261
Drayton, come on,
come on, come on!

1319
01:24:22,361 --> 01:24:24,405
Come on, Drayton, he's dead!
Come on!

1320
01:24:55,602 --> 01:24:56,895
Open the door!

1321
01:24:58,564 --> 01:24:59,673
Where's Bobby?

1322
01:24:59,773 --> 01:25:00,816
Daddy!

1323
01:25:02,318 --> 01:25:03,385
Close up the doors!

1324
01:25:03,485 --> 01:25:04,511
Hurry up!

1325
01:25:04,611 --> 01:25:06,055
What happened?

1326
01:25:06,155 --> 01:25:08,866
They're dead!
They're all dead!

1327
01:25:25,507 --> 01:25:27,785
...expiation, because we have seen

1328
01:25:27,885 --> 01:25:30,412
the earth scourged
with whips and scorpions.

1329
01:25:30,512 --> 01:25:34,500
We have seen the earth
vomit forth from her lips

1330
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:38,963
obscenities and profanities
of such nightmare proportions.

1331
01:25:39,063 --> 01:25:42,883
And for these evil, lurking spirits,

1332
01:25:42,983 --> 01:25:44,927
and for these evil people...

1333
01:25:45,027 --> 01:25:46,345
How long was I out?

1334
01:25:46,445 --> 01:25:47,863
Most of the day.

1335
01:25:48,906 --> 01:25:51,433
You just came over here,
lay down, and went to sleep.

1336
01:25:51,533 --> 01:25:53,102
Just passed out, is more like it.

1337
01:25:53,202 --> 01:25:54,645
What will stop this Great Whore?

1338
01:25:54,745 --> 01:25:57,690
Just shut down for a while. Sorry.

1339
01:25:57,790 --> 01:25:59,358
How will it end?

1340
01:25:59,458 --> 01:26:00,484
Expiation!

1341
01:26:00,584 --> 01:26:03,112
Expiation!
Do you remember yesterday when...

1342
01:26:03,212 --> 01:26:04,863
How's Joe?

1343
01:26:04,963 --> 01:26:08,425
Dead. Joe died of his burns
while you were asleep.

1344
01:26:09,051 --> 01:26:10,744
We were just too late.

1345
01:26:10,844 --> 01:26:14,623
- I told you this would come!
- Oh, God, I thought I was dreaming her voice.

1346
01:26:14,723 --> 01:26:16,041
No dream.

1347
01:26:16,141 --> 01:26:18,294
She's getting people whipped up.

1348
01:26:18,394 --> 01:26:23,590
That poor girl is dead,
and that boy is burnt in the back room!

1349
01:26:23,690 --> 01:26:27,511
She's got 'em believing she's a psychic;
she has a direct line with God.

1350
01:26:27,611 --> 01:26:30,097
Why wouldn't they?
Woman never shuts up.

1351
01:26:30,197 --> 01:26:32,491
Like those speeches
Castro used to make.

1352
01:26:35,244 --> 01:26:38,522
Ollie says you're thinking of leaving.

1353
01:26:38,622 --> 01:26:39,940
I'm in.

1354
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:41,984
No. Sorry.

1355
01:26:42,084 --> 01:26:45,821
I mean, come on, you saw what
happened to Bobby... Mike...

1356
01:26:45,921 --> 01:26:49,700
I won't... do that again.
I won't be responsible.

1357
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:51,285
You might want to reconsider that.

1358
01:26:51,385 --> 01:26:54,663
What will-- what will keep
these evil, these abominations at bay?

1359
01:26:54,763 --> 01:26:56,248
What will keep them away?

1360
01:26:56,348 --> 01:26:59,209
"The rock will not hide them.
The dead tree gives no shelter."

1361
01:26:59,309 --> 01:27:00,794
What will end it?
Let me hear it.

1362
01:27:00,894 --> 01:27:02,838
- Expiation!
- So what are we talking about?

1363
01:27:02,938 --> 01:27:05,424
- Expiation!
- Yeah, say it again like you mean it!

1364
01:27:05,524 --> 01:27:06,800
Expiation!

1365
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:11,889
Welcome to Sesame Street.
Today's word is "expiation."

1366
01:27:11,989 --> 01:27:14,016
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

1367
01:27:14,116 --> 01:27:16,685
That boy hasn't been right
since the pharmacy.

1368
01:27:16,785 --> 01:27:19,772
His mind's just snapped. Gone.

1369
01:27:19,872 --> 01:27:21,457
Hasn't even been two days.

1370
01:27:22,458 --> 01:27:23,942
Not even two days.

1371
01:27:24,042 --> 01:27:26,612
I'm not spendin' the rest
of my life here, I'll tell you what.

1372
01:27:26,712 --> 01:27:29,365
I can quietly gather up
some bags of groceries

1373
01:27:29,465 --> 01:27:32,743
and hide them up at one of
the check stands by the door.

1374
01:27:32,843 --> 01:27:35,120
It was your idea.
It's your vehicle.

1375
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:36,722
It'll be your call.

1376
01:27:38,682 --> 01:27:41,185
I'd rather die out there trying
than in here waiting.

1377
01:27:43,312 --> 01:27:45,547
<i>Who will save them? No one.</i>

1378
01:27:45,647 --> 01:27:48,717
<i>These rocks will not hide them.</i>

1379
01:27:48,817 --> 01:27:53,572
I want some idea of what we're up against.
I want to know what this mist is.

1380
01:27:54,573 --> 01:27:57,434
- I want to talk to the soldiers.
- Soldiers? What's that gonna do?

1381
01:27:57,534 --> 01:27:59,686
You heard what that M.P. said
at the pharmacy.

1382
01:27:59,786 --> 01:28:02,064
David, I'm not even sure
I knew he was talking.

1383
01:28:02,164 --> 01:28:03,816
The situation was insane.

1384
01:28:03,916 --> 01:28:05,692
He said he was sorry.

1385
01:28:05,792 --> 01:28:07,736
Wasn't that the word
he used-- "sorry"?

1386
01:28:07,836 --> 01:28:10,114
That's right.
He said it was their fault, right?

1387
01:28:10,214 --> 01:28:14,034
- What did he mean by that?
- That's what we're gonna find out.

1388
01:28:14,134 --> 01:28:15,744
Irene, stay with Billy, please.

1389
01:28:15,844 --> 01:28:17,162
<i>"The 7th Angel..."</i>

1390
01:28:17,262 --> 01:28:19,706
"...poured out his vial into the air,"

1391
01:28:19,806 --> 01:28:21,667
"and there came a great voice"

1392
01:28:21,767 --> 01:28:24,461
"out of the temple of heaven
from the throne, saying,"

1393
01:28:24,561 --> 01:28:27,047
"'It is done! It is done!"

1394
01:28:27,147 --> 01:28:30,384
"And there were voices
and lightning,"

1395
01:28:30,484 --> 01:28:33,470
"and thunders,
and a great earthquake."

1396
01:28:33,570 --> 01:28:36,223
Yes! Come to me!

1397
01:28:36,323 --> 01:28:37,433
What?

1398
01:28:37,533 --> 01:28:39,768
- Where's your friends?
- I ain't seen 'em.

1399
01:28:39,868 --> 01:28:42,104
Not that big a store.
It's kinda hard to lose.

1400
01:28:42,204 --> 01:28:45,207
I ain't seen 'em, I said.
I look like their keeper?

1401
01:28:48,335 --> 01:28:51,280
- What do you want from me?
- What do you know about this mist?

1402
01:28:51,380 --> 01:28:53,782
I don't know nothin'.
I got nothin' to do with it.

1403
01:28:53,882 --> 01:28:57,678
That's not what the M.P. said in the pharmacy
before the spiders came out of his skin.

1404
01:28:59,096 --> 01:29:00,831
They're not in the store.

1405
01:29:00,931 --> 01:29:04,084
The only place we haven't looked
is the loading dock.

1406
01:29:04,184 --> 01:29:05,210
...because you know.

1407
01:29:05,310 --> 01:29:07,379
You saw the good face
of God tonight.

1408
01:29:07,479 --> 01:29:08,714
Yes? Tell us.

1409
01:29:08,814 --> 01:29:11,008
Here is an old man who has seen!

1410
01:29:11,108 --> 01:29:13,218
Yes, he has seen!

1411
01:29:13,318 --> 01:29:14,344
Amen.

1412
01:29:14,444 --> 01:29:18,098
And I want to say,
do I want to walk with you

1413
01:29:18,198 --> 01:29:20,867
into my Father's hands?

1414
01:29:21,368 --> 01:29:22,411
Morales.

1415
01:29:23,412 --> 01:29:24,454
Donaldson.

1416
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,250
Guys...

1417
01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:33,989
- It's the only place they can be.
- What?

1418
01:29:34,089 --> 01:29:35,491
Couldn't just disappear.

1419
01:29:35,591 --> 01:29:38,552
Look, I told you,
okay, I don't know where they are--

1420
01:29:45,642 --> 01:29:47,377
I didn't think they'd do it.

1421
01:29:47,477 --> 01:29:49,755
They said they would do it, and I just--

1422
01:29:49,855 --> 01:29:53,217
I told them what the M.P. said at the pharmacy,
and they swore they'd do it.

1423
01:29:53,317 --> 01:29:56,053
I just-- I didn't think they would. Oh, Jesus!

1424
01:29:56,153 --> 01:29:59,306
It's the Arrowhead Project, isn't it?

1425
01:29:59,406 --> 01:30:02,893
This mist, it's some kind of,
what, military fuckup?

1426
01:30:02,993 --> 01:30:04,645
What were you guys
messin' with up there, huh?

1427
01:30:04,745 --> 01:30:07,523
We got you now,
you sorry son of a bitch!

1428
01:30:07,623 --> 01:30:08,649
Get in there!

1429
01:30:08,749 --> 01:30:11,652
It was them!
It was them what done it to us!

1430
01:30:11,752 --> 01:30:15,239
It was them what brung down
the final wrath upon us!

1431
01:30:15,339 --> 01:30:17,741
Those two peckerwoods
that he's been with this whole time,

1432
01:30:17,841 --> 01:30:20,202
they hung themselves in the back
because they knew!

1433
01:30:20,302 --> 01:30:21,787
They knew it all along!

1434
01:30:21,887 --> 01:30:23,705
- He's crazy. He doesn't know--
- Get on your knees!

1435
01:30:23,805 --> 01:30:25,082
Stay out of it, Drayton!

1436
01:30:25,182 --> 01:30:27,209
They heard it too, didn't you?
All of ya!

1437
01:30:27,309 --> 01:30:30,712
All about the Arrowhead Project
and all that secret shit up on the mountain.

1438
01:30:30,812 --> 01:30:32,297
That's what brung it down on us.

1439
01:30:32,397 --> 01:30:34,441
That's what brung down the wrath of God!

1440
01:30:37,361 --> 01:30:39,321
Private Jessup.

1441
01:30:41,198 --> 01:30:42,349
It wasn't me.

1442
01:30:42,449 --> 01:30:44,726
I'm just--
I'm stationed up there.

1443
01:30:44,826 --> 01:30:46,270
I'm not responsible--

1444
01:30:46,370 --> 01:30:47,938
- Bullshit!
- Hell, I'm a local!

1445
01:30:48,038 --> 01:30:50,065
Most of you people know me.

1446
01:30:50,165 --> 01:30:55,279
You stop your chicken shit whining
or I will cut your puling tongue out.

1447
01:30:55,379 --> 01:30:56,963
Now you tell us!

1448
01:30:58,465 --> 01:31:00,117
Tell us.

1449
01:31:00,217 --> 01:31:02,869
Look, look. Okay, okay.

1450
01:31:02,969 --> 01:31:04,371
I heard stuff.

1451
01:31:04,471 --> 01:31:05,747
Stuff?

1452
01:31:05,847 --> 01:31:07,849
Yes, we all heard stuff.

1453
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:12,921
Like how they,

1454
01:31:13,021 --> 01:31:15,090
how they thought
that there were other dimensions,

1455
01:31:15,190 --> 01:31:17,968
you know, other--
other worlds all around us,

1456
01:31:18,068 --> 01:31:20,554
and how they wanted
to try and make, um,

1457
01:31:20,654 --> 01:31:22,097
a window--

1458
01:31:22,197 --> 01:31:24,958
you know, so they could look through
and see what's on the other side.

1459
01:31:27,035 --> 01:31:29,730
Well, maybe your window
turned out to be a door. Didn't it?

1460
01:31:29,830 --> 01:31:31,648
Not mine! Those scientists'!

1461
01:31:31,748 --> 01:31:34,318
- Oh, the scientists!
<i>- Yes, the scientists!</i>

1462
01:31:34,418 --> 01:31:36,445
They must have ripped
a hole open by accident.

1463
01:31:36,545 --> 01:31:38,363
This other world
came spilling through to ours.

1464
01:31:38,463 --> 01:31:41,742
That's what Donaldson was saying
to me right before he killed himself.

1465
01:31:41,842 --> 01:31:43,844
I didn't understand the half of it.

1466
01:31:45,762 --> 01:31:47,347
It ain't my fault!

1467
01:31:49,558 --> 01:31:52,878
Ain't. His. Fault.

1468
01:31:52,978 --> 01:31:55,464
No, no, no.

1469
01:31:55,564 --> 01:31:59,551
Ain't nothin' ever anybody's fault.

1470
01:31:59,651 --> 01:32:01,970
But he denies it.

1471
01:32:02,070 --> 01:32:04,514
He points the finger,

1472
01:32:04,614 --> 01:32:07,726
this Judas in our midst.

1473
01:32:07,826 --> 01:32:08,852
Judas!

1474
01:32:08,952 --> 01:32:10,687
David!

1475
01:32:10,787 --> 01:32:13,023
You! You!

1476
01:32:13,123 --> 01:32:15,025
Don't you know by now?

1477
01:32:15,125 --> 01:32:17,194
Don't you know the truth?

1478
01:32:17,294 --> 01:32:19,863
We are being punished.

1479
01:32:19,963 --> 01:32:23,492
For what? For going
against the will of God!

1480
01:32:23,592 --> 01:32:27,829
For going against
His forbidden rules of old!

1481
01:32:27,929 --> 01:32:29,373
Walking on the moon!

1482
01:32:29,473 --> 01:32:30,957
Yes! Yes!

1483
01:32:31,057 --> 01:32:33,919
- Or-- or splitting His atoms!
- Amen!

1484
01:32:34,019 --> 01:32:38,715
Or-- or-- or stem cells and abortions!

1485
01:32:38,815 --> 01:32:41,760
And destroying the secrets of life

1486
01:32:41,860 --> 01:32:45,097
that only God above has any right to!

1487
01:32:45,197 --> 01:32:46,682
Amen! Amen!

1488
01:32:46,782 --> 01:32:49,309
Yes, I know! It is true!

1489
01:32:49,409 --> 01:32:51,978
And now we are being punished.

1490
01:32:52,078 --> 01:32:54,940
The judgment is being
brought down upon us.

1491
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:57,693
The fiends of hell,
you see they are let loose,

1492
01:32:57,793 --> 01:33:01,405
and star Wormwood blazes!

1493
01:33:01,505 --> 01:33:02,739
And it is his fault!

1494
01:33:02,839 --> 01:33:06,201
No! No! It is not my fault! No!

1495
01:33:06,301 --> 01:33:09,246
They did it! They spit
in the eye of the Almighty!

1496
01:33:09,346 --> 01:33:10,372
No!

1497
01:33:10,472 --> 01:33:12,599
Get over there!

1498
01:33:13,141 --> 01:33:14,251
No!

1499
01:33:14,351 --> 01:33:15,977
Judas!

1500
01:33:17,270 --> 01:33:18,296
Jim!

1501
01:33:18,396 --> 01:33:20,816
Kill him! String him up!

1502
01:33:23,860 --> 01:33:25,554
Stand up, you coward!

1503
01:33:30,158 --> 01:33:31,284
Jesus!

1504
01:33:34,246 --> 01:33:35,480
No!

1505
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:39,151
Expiation!

1506
01:33:39,251 --> 01:33:40,877
- No!
- Stab him!

1507
01:33:42,420 --> 01:33:44,322
Expiation!

1508
01:33:44,422 --> 01:33:47,117
Feed him to the beast!

1509
01:33:47,217 --> 01:33:49,161
Expiation!

1510
01:33:49,261 --> 01:33:53,223
Let the abominations
smell his blood!

1511
01:33:54,724 --> 01:33:56,376
No, no! No!

1512
01:33:59,145 --> 01:34:02,357
- Jesus! Wait!
- No, David!

1513
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:00,498
Please.

1514
01:35:11,134 --> 01:35:13,803
The beast will leave us alone tonight.

1515
01:35:15,263 --> 01:35:16,514
Tomorrow...

1516
01:35:17,641 --> 01:35:20,143
tomorrow, we'll just
have to wait and see.

1517
01:35:29,486 --> 01:35:30,654
Daddy.

1518
01:35:32,322 --> 01:35:33,490
Daddy.

1519
01:35:45,335 --> 01:35:47,170
Sorry I left you, pal.

1520
01:35:49,506 --> 01:35:51,174
I'll never leave you again.

1521
01:35:52,509 --> 01:35:53,677
Promise?

1522
01:35:55,095 --> 01:35:58,790
But you have to give me
your best promise, okay?

1523
01:35:58,890 --> 01:36:02,252
Your very best promise,
and can never break it.

1524
01:36:02,352 --> 01:36:04,104
Tell me.

1525
01:36:05,814 --> 01:36:08,149
Promise you won't let
the monsters get me.

1526
01:36:11,820 --> 01:36:13,989
Ever. No matter what.

1527
01:36:15,657 --> 01:36:17,158
I promise.

1528
01:36:20,370 --> 01:36:22,188
I love you, Daddy.

1529
01:36:22,288 --> 01:36:24,165
I love you, Billy.

1530
01:36:25,166 --> 01:36:26,501
More than anything.

1531
01:36:56,197 --> 01:36:57,365
It's dawn.

1532
01:37:02,787 --> 01:37:05,607
Hey, pal, you ready to go home?

1533
01:37:05,707 --> 01:37:07,042
Come on.

1534
01:37:09,461 --> 01:37:12,447
Okay, I got the groceries
hidden at check stand number two.

1535
01:37:12,547 --> 01:37:15,075
Five bags. We can grab 'em
and get out the door.

1536
01:37:15,175 --> 01:37:16,409
Okay.

1537
01:37:16,509 --> 01:37:20,205
My car's parked in the center lane
of the parking lot, far end.

1538
01:37:20,305 --> 01:37:22,499
Whoever gets there first,
open up both doors,

1539
01:37:22,599 --> 01:37:25,210
and we'll all pile in
as fast as we can, okay?

1540
01:37:25,310 --> 01:37:26,436
Let's go.

1541
01:37:49,834 --> 01:37:52,045
Stealing food now?

1542
01:37:56,299 --> 01:37:58,301
Going out now, Mrs. Carmody.

1543
01:37:59,636 --> 01:38:01,262
Please stand aside.

1544
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:05,250
You can't go out.
I won't allow it.

1545
01:38:05,350 --> 01:38:06,626
Won't allow it?

1546
01:38:06,726 --> 01:38:09,337
It's against God's will.

1547
01:38:09,437 --> 01:38:11,589
Don't you know that by now?

1548
01:38:11,689 --> 01:38:16,177
Haven't I proven myself
again and again and again?

1549
01:38:16,277 --> 01:38:20,740
Haven't I shown that I am His vessel?

1550
01:38:25,620 --> 01:38:27,122
What's the matter with you?

1551
01:38:30,458 --> 01:38:31,918
Don't you believe in God?

1552
01:38:32,919 --> 01:38:34,487
No one's interfered with you.

1553
01:38:34,587 --> 01:38:37,157
All we're asking for
is the same privilege.

1554
01:38:37,257 --> 01:38:38,550
You heard him.

1555
01:38:40,135 --> 01:38:44,139
It is these people
who brought this upon us.

1556
01:38:45,348 --> 01:38:50,378
They-- people who refused
to bend to the will of God,

1557
01:38:50,478 --> 01:38:53,048
and claim it privilege.

1558
01:38:53,148 --> 01:38:56,134
Sinners in pride.

1559
01:38:56,234 --> 01:38:58,219
Yes, haughty.

1560
01:38:58,319 --> 01:39:00,388
Privileged!

1561
01:39:00,488 --> 01:39:04,267
They mock us. They mock our--
our God, our faith,

1562
01:39:04,367 --> 01:39:07,771
our values, our very lifestyle.

1563
01:39:07,871 --> 01:39:10,065
They mock our humility

1564
01:39:10,165 --> 01:39:12,067
and our piousness.

1565
01:39:12,167 --> 01:39:15,170
They piss on us and laugh.

1566
01:39:18,423 --> 01:39:23,661
It's from them the blood
of human sacrifice must come.

1567
01:39:23,761 --> 01:39:25,705
From them...

1568
01:39:25,805 --> 01:39:28,374
- Come on.
- ...the blood of expiation.

1569
01:39:28,474 --> 01:39:29,501
Come on.

1570
01:39:29,601 --> 01:39:31,044
You try it.

1571
01:39:31,144 --> 01:39:32,462
Fuckin' try it!

1572
01:39:32,562 --> 01:39:34,005
Come on!

1573
01:39:34,105 --> 01:39:36,299
- Get 'em!
- We want the boy.

1574
01:39:36,399 --> 01:39:37,759
- We want the boy!
- You get back!

1575
01:39:37,859 --> 01:39:39,928
- Yeah!
- You get back!

1576
01:39:40,028 --> 01:39:40,929
The boy!

1577
01:39:41,029 --> 01:39:42,430
David! David!

1578
01:39:42,530 --> 01:39:44,349
Grab that boy! Grab him!

1579
01:39:44,449 --> 01:39:46,768
Get off me!

1580
01:39:46,868 --> 01:39:48,311
Get off me! Get off me!

1581
01:39:48,411 --> 01:39:49,746
Grab him!

1582
01:39:51,372 --> 01:39:53,191
And get the whore too!

1583
01:39:53,291 --> 01:39:54,734
Grab her!

1584
01:39:54,834 --> 01:39:57,212
Kill 'em! Kill 'em all!

1585
01:40:12,268 --> 01:40:13,937
Stay down!
Stay down! Stay down!

1586
01:40:21,027 --> 01:40:22,695
I-- I killed her.

1587
01:40:24,822 --> 01:40:26,074
Thank you, Ollie.

1588
01:40:28,034 --> 01:40:29,285
Let's go.

1589
01:40:30,370 --> 01:40:33,581
Get that ice machine
out of the way, please.

1590
01:40:36,084 --> 01:40:37,735
You killed her!

1591
01:40:37,835 --> 01:40:40,129
You murdered her!

1592
01:40:43,716 --> 01:40:46,911
I wouldn't have shot her, Dave,
not if there'd been any other way.

1593
01:40:47,011 --> 01:40:48,454
That's why I said thank you.

1594
01:40:48,554 --> 01:40:49,706
Okay.

1595
01:40:49,806 --> 01:40:52,083
Okay, then... let's go!

1596
01:40:52,183 --> 01:40:55,086
Get up, Myron!

1597
01:40:55,186 --> 01:40:57,522
- Come on! We gotta go!
- My ankle!

1598
01:41:05,905 --> 01:41:10,143
Okay. All the way down!
Where are they?

1599
01:41:10,243 --> 01:41:12,645
Bud! Myron!

1600
01:41:12,745 --> 01:41:13,771
Ambrose!

1601
01:41:13,871 --> 01:41:15,440
I think I broke it!

1602
01:41:15,540 --> 01:41:17,066
Come on! Come on!

1603
01:41:17,166 --> 01:41:18,610
We gotta go!
Come on, come on!

1604
01:41:18,710 --> 01:41:19,961
They're lost!

1605
01:41:27,677 --> 01:41:29,245
- Oh, Jesus.
- Ollie!

1606
01:41:29,345 --> 01:41:31,931
Ollie!

1607
01:42:11,679 --> 01:42:13,014
All that screaming!

1608
01:42:14,182 --> 01:42:16,434
Are they out there?
Can they see us?

1609
01:42:26,361 --> 01:42:28,780
Let me-- let me in!
Let me in!

1610
01:42:43,211 --> 01:42:44,712
Are we going?

1611
01:42:51,552 --> 01:42:52,787
- No.
- Yeah.

1612
01:42:52,887 --> 01:42:54,956
- No! No!
- Yeah!

1613
01:42:55,056 --> 01:42:56,332
- Daddy.
- David.

1614
01:42:56,432 --> 01:42:58,334
- David, no.
- Daddy, no.

1615
01:42:58,434 --> 01:43:00,169
- David!
- Daddy!

1616
01:43:00,269 --> 01:43:01,754
Get back in the car!

1617
01:43:01,854 --> 01:43:03,481
- Daddy!
- David!

1618
01:43:13,866 --> 01:43:15,476
Oh, my God!

1619
01:43:18,413 --> 01:43:20,373
Oh, my God!

1620
01:43:40,476 --> 01:43:41,519
We gotta go.

1621
01:45:40,721 --> 01:45:42,723
I told her I'd fix it.

1622
01:45:46,102 --> 01:45:49,438
Front window... broken open.

1623
01:45:53,192 --> 01:45:54,360
Tree.

1624
01:45:56,487 --> 01:45:59,907
My... grandfather's tree.

1625
01:46:14,964 --> 01:46:18,301
I'm sorry, David,
I'm just so sorry.

1626
01:46:33,357 --> 01:46:37,903
Let's, see how far this...

1627
01:46:39,655 --> 01:46:41,907
fuel takes us, huh?

1628
01:46:44,994 --> 01:46:46,996
Maybe we'll get clear of the mist.

1629
01:50:03,275 --> 01:50:04,527
Well...

1630
01:50:05,778 --> 01:50:07,738
we gave it a good shot.

1631
01:50:09,156 --> 01:50:10,658
Nobody can say we didn't.

1632
01:50:12,660 --> 01:50:14,395
Nope.

1633
01:50:14,495 --> 01:50:16,288
Nobody can say that.

1634
01:51:45,294 --> 01:51:46,545
Well...

1635
01:51:48,547 --> 01:51:50,090
We got...

1636
01:51:54,470 --> 01:51:55,721
four.

1637
01:52:00,017 --> 01:52:01,268
Four bullets.

1638
01:52:05,814 --> 01:52:07,316
But there's five of us.

1639
01:52:17,868 --> 01:52:19,620
I'll figure something out.

1640
01:54:18,405 --> 01:54:19,823
Come on!

1641
01:54:25,829 --> 01:54:27,164
Come on!

1642
01:54:28,457 --> 01:54:29,958
Come on!

1643
01:54:33,337 --> 01:54:36,323
Come on. Come on.

1644
01:54:36,423 --> 01:54:39,593
Come on.

1645
01:54:46,850 --> 01:54:48,143
Come on.

1646
01:54:48,352 --> 01:54:49,937
Come on.

1647
01:54:50,187 --> 01:54:51,730
Come on.

1648
01:54:52,773 --> 01:54:54,900
Come on, come on!

1649
01:54:55,109 --> 01:54:57,820
Come on! Come on!

1650
01:56:34,958 --> 01:56:37,402
They're-- they're dead.

1651
01:56:37,502 --> 01:56:39,004
For what?

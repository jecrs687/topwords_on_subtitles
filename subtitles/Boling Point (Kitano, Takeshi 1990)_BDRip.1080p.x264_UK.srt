4
00:01:55,057 --> 00:01:57,555
Playing in
such a dusty place...

5
00:01:58,304 --> 00:01:59,428
They're stupid.

6
00:01:59,637 --> 00:02:01,926
Watching makes us worse.

7
00:02:02,425 --> 00:02:03,674
Shut up! Damn you!

8
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:12,416
Did you come to take
a crap or play ball?

9
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,998
Why stay in the can so long?

10
00:02:18,036 --> 00:02:19,035
Good !

11
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:27,985
Can't you guys
get any points?

12
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,066
So far, nothing.

13
00:02:31,522 --> 00:02:34,479
Watch it! Get a hit!

14
00:02:37,517 --> 00:02:39,182
At least get one point.

15
00:02:56,748 --> 00:02:58,081
Too bad!

16
00:02:59,912 --> 00:03:01,535
We'll try harder.

17
00:03:01,743 --> 00:03:02,992
Next batter?

18
00:03:03,242 --> 00:03:04,699
Akira, you're next!

19
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:07,613
Akira!

20
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:13,067
l need a coach.

21
00:03:13,857 --> 00:03:15,065
Someone, go!

22
00:03:16,105 --> 00:03:18,062
Go coach him.

23
00:03:19,518 --> 00:03:22,307
Somebody who knows
more about baseball.

24
00:03:22,682 --> 00:03:25,055
What are you saying? Ass!

25
00:03:25,429 --> 00:03:27,218
Just standing is enough.

26
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,092
You go.

27
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:49,364
Watch the ball!

28
00:04:28,493 --> 00:04:32,448
Give a sign.
Turn your hand or something.

29
00:04:32,697 --> 00:04:34,654
Don't just watch.

30
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,172
Here we go!

31
00:05:25,396 --> 00:05:26,812
What are you doing?

32
00:05:29,975 --> 00:05:32,140
You're coaching
the other team.

33
00:05:34,013 --> 00:05:36,844
Quit! Just pick up balls!

34
00:06:00,446 --> 00:06:02,902
Pitcher! Look what
you've done!

35
00:06:03,902 --> 00:06:05,900
You hit him on purpose!

36
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,855
What if something
happens to him?

37
00:06:09,063 --> 00:06:10,520
Don't get so upset.

38
00:06:10,686 --> 00:06:12,310
Shut up! Apologize!

39
00:06:13,058 --> 00:06:14,016
That's enough.

40
00:06:14,681 --> 00:06:15,473
l'm sorry.

41
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:18,720
l'm telling him off
for your sake.

42
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:21,425
lt's your fault!

43
00:06:39,367 --> 00:06:41,615
This is the last inning.

44
00:06:42,654 --> 00:06:44,570
Get at least one point.

45
00:06:45,694 --> 00:06:47,109
Hopeless kids!

46
00:06:51,064 --> 00:06:53,603
Don't sit on my glove.

47
00:06:54,685 --> 00:06:57,724
Hey, you! Pinch-hit!

48
00:06:59,431 --> 00:07:01,054
He won't make it.

49
00:07:01,304 --> 00:07:02,595
Two out already.

50
00:07:04,134 --> 00:07:06,175
Umpire, a pinch-hitter!

51
00:07:07,423 --> 00:07:08,256
Go!

52
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:18,704
l'm giving you a chance.
Hit one!

53
00:07:22,783 --> 00:07:24,864
Too high! lt's a strike?

54
00:07:27,695 --> 00:07:30,193
Hit the next one!
Take a chance!

55
00:07:35,147 --> 00:07:38,768
Never mind.
Pick a better ball.

56
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:57,458
Charment wins 5-0.
Take a bow!

57
00:08:03,161 --> 00:08:07,241
You should've swung
your bat at least once.

58
00:08:12,817 --> 00:08:14,233
Why be seated?

59
00:08:14,691 --> 00:08:15,649
lt's over.

60
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:20,186
We've ten minutes left.
Play catch or something.

61
00:08:20,977 --> 00:08:21,934
Go away!

62
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,115
Swing your bat 100 times
a day. You'll improve.

63
00:08:52,904 --> 00:08:55,194
Come on, let's go!

64
00:09:09,388 --> 00:09:11,885
Sorry for a while ago.

65
00:09:13,301 --> 00:09:15,674
l get excited so easily.

66
00:09:36,653 --> 00:09:38,984
You're late. What kept you?

67
00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:41,607
l have a date. See?

68
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:46,561
Change clothes fast
and wash that Mercedes.

69
00:09:47,268 --> 00:09:49,558
Wait a sec. l'll change.

70
00:10:10,621 --> 00:10:14,617
l went to his place,
but he's missing.

71
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:16,074
Sure.

72
00:10:16,865 --> 00:10:19,695
Nobody knows where he is.

73
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,068
Maybe he ran.

74
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:30,310
l'm at a gas station.
l'll be back in half an hour.

75
00:10:32,975 --> 00:10:36,429
Sure. l'll be back soon.

76
00:10:40,966 --> 00:10:44,338
My car... through already?

77
00:10:47,877 --> 00:10:49,084
Speak up!

78
00:10:55,453 --> 00:10:58,200
You haven't done
one damn thing!

79
00:11:01,572 --> 00:11:04,943
The wheels are still dirty!

80
00:11:28,005 --> 00:11:29,212
The ashtray...

81
00:11:34,123 --> 00:11:36,912
l'm going. ls the tank full?

82
00:11:39,368 --> 00:11:40,991
l don't know.

83
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:46,361
Not yet?

84
00:11:51,773 --> 00:11:52,690
Hey!

85
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,518
Don't make light of me!

86
00:12:08,174 --> 00:12:09,089
l'm sorry.

87
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:16,957
He hasn't done a thing.
What's going on?

88
00:12:19,497 --> 00:12:21,412
lsn't this your job?

89
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:28,363
l'm sorry.

90
00:12:31,193 --> 00:12:33,441
Dammit, do your
work properly!

91
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,227
l'm very sorry.

92
00:12:42,224 --> 00:12:46,013
You do it right, or
l'll make you go broke!

93
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,172
What do you want?

94
00:12:57,792 --> 00:12:58,625
No!

95
00:13:00,165 --> 00:13:01,663
You goddam punk!

96
00:13:02,954 --> 00:13:07,533
lt hurts! Maybe
my arm's broken.

97
00:13:08,824 --> 00:13:10,322
l'll go see a doc.

98
00:13:24,684 --> 00:13:25,600
How was it?

99
00:13:25,725 --> 00:13:30,552
The doctor said
his arm is all right.

100
00:13:31,593 --> 00:13:37,004
But his boss will come to
settle it. What'll we do?

101
00:14:05,852 --> 00:14:06,560
Yes?

102
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,891
l took today off.

103
00:14:13,469 --> 00:14:16,966
l have to deliver this.
Want to come?

104
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:19,214
Follow me.

105
00:14:45,813 --> 00:14:46,687
You all right?

106
00:14:49,852 --> 00:14:52,182
lt's fast. Be careful.

107
00:14:58,675 --> 00:15:00,008
He has no license.

108
00:15:07,334 --> 00:15:08,500
Which is better?

109
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,707
This one.

110
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:10,956
l don't want it.

111
00:15:15,993 --> 00:15:17,158
He doesn't want it!

112
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,181
l want time off.

113
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:41,676
Hey, don't you have a date?

114
00:15:45,256 --> 00:15:46,089
No.

115
00:15:48,795 --> 00:15:50,876
Why not pick up a chick?

116
00:15:52,332 --> 00:15:53,289
lt won't work.

117
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,411
Try and see.

118
00:16:03,488 --> 00:16:04,321
l'll leave.

119
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:10,107
This is for you.

120
00:16:12,147 --> 00:16:13,521
Try, okay?

121
00:16:40,661 --> 00:16:42,076
What time do you finish?

122
00:16:43,534 --> 00:16:44,907
We close at 11.

123
00:17:02,265 --> 00:17:03,680
Got a motorcycle?

124
00:17:08,842 --> 00:17:09,799
Want to come?

125
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:24,519
Where are you going?

126
00:18:26,434 --> 00:18:28,223
Where are you going?

127
00:18:45,081 --> 00:18:48,412
You listening?
Don't glare at us.

128
00:18:49,786 --> 00:18:53,074
This road's wide enough.
Be more careful!

129
00:19:26,709 --> 00:19:30,413
We're gangsters.
We can't go to the cops.

130
00:19:31,621 --> 00:19:33,744
Just do what you can.

131
00:19:35,492 --> 00:19:38,490
We'll pay his medical fee.

132
00:19:40,196 --> 00:19:44,274
We're mobsters, but
l'm not here to threaten you.

133
00:19:46,939 --> 00:19:51,809
We don't want to cause
a fuss in the neighborhood.

134
00:19:53,308 --> 00:19:54,764
Just do what you can.

135
00:19:55,847 --> 00:19:57,929
Thank you.

136
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:04,422
We'll pay the medical fee.

137
00:20:06,628 --> 00:20:10,999
We're gangsters. Don't you
know what we're here for?

138
00:20:28,857 --> 00:20:29,940
You did it?

139
00:20:32,395 --> 00:20:33,686
Why not join us?

140
00:20:38,515 --> 00:20:42,260
A gangster came.
He from the Otomo Group?

141
00:20:43,967 --> 00:20:45,882
You hit his man, right?

142
00:20:47,298 --> 00:20:48,587
He hit me first.

143
00:20:49,004 --> 00:20:51,668
You shouldn't have
fought back.

144
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:54,915
So, he came
to bulldoze you.

145
00:20:55,914 --> 00:20:56,872
What'll you do?

146
00:20:58,287 --> 00:21:00,993
l'll go to their office.

147
00:21:01,784 --> 00:21:03,241
You will? What for?

148
00:21:07,778 --> 00:21:10,358
We'll talk and settle it.

149
00:21:11,774 --> 00:21:13,230
No, you can't.

150
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:16,894
You were with Otomo, right?

151
00:21:18,933 --> 00:21:19,974
Welcome!

152
00:21:21,515 --> 00:21:22,888
Go with him.

153
00:21:29,008 --> 00:21:30,672
What a sty!

154
00:21:30,881 --> 00:21:33,170
Anyway we can drink.

155
00:21:38,082 --> 00:21:39,788
Want a highball?

156
00:21:44,533 --> 00:21:46,032
Can't make one?

157
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,447
Pork cutlet on rice.

158
00:21:53,484 --> 00:21:54,940
Make it highballs.

159
00:21:56,147 --> 00:21:57,271
Got a john?

160
00:21:58,479 --> 00:21:59,269
Over there.

161
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,726
l bet it's dirty.

162
00:22:02,226 --> 00:22:03,682
Probably so.

163
00:22:04,598 --> 00:22:06,097
Got an ashtray?

164
00:22:10,842 --> 00:22:11,757
Shall l sing?

165
00:22:18,335 --> 00:22:19,250
What's wrong?

166
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:23,746
lt was filthy!
lt absolutely reeks!

167
00:22:28,491 --> 00:22:30,364
Piss outside then!

168
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:39,272
Get out!

169
00:22:47,182 --> 00:22:48,556
How's business?

170
00:22:53,134 --> 00:22:55,090
Today's customers are lousy.

171
00:22:58,255 --> 00:23:01,252
They borrow but
don't pay back.

172
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:04,416
The world's nuts.

173
00:23:43,253 --> 00:23:44,792
Hi, Mr. lguchi!

174
00:23:46,582 --> 00:23:49,455
Muto, how have you been?

175
00:23:56,365 --> 00:23:58,696
l talked with Otomo.

176
00:24:00,694 --> 00:24:02,859
About that gas station...

177
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,729
Whatever happened,
will you overlook it?

178
00:24:09,061 --> 00:24:11,433
My man's arm was broken.

179
00:24:12,474 --> 00:24:14,431
We can't ignore it.

180
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,803
Do as l say!

181
00:24:19,134 --> 00:24:23,172
Mr. lguchi, didn't you
quit being a gangster?

182
00:24:25,462 --> 00:24:27,460
You're no longer my boss.

183
00:24:29,209 --> 00:24:30,748
Mr. lguchi, huh?

184
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:35,992
From now on l'll
just call you lguchi.

185
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,406
Got it, lguchi?

186
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:49,272
What's all this, Otomo?

187
00:24:52,269 --> 00:24:54,475
Don't ''Otomo'' me!

188
00:24:56,266 --> 00:24:58,846
This is how we work to live.

189
00:25:01,135 --> 00:25:02,676
Spoiled guy!

190
00:25:04,715 --> 00:25:06,463
Bring money first.

191
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,585
That's what we want .

192
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:52,503
Sorry for a while ago.

193
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,790
Can we talk?

194
00:25:58,663 --> 00:26:00,785
All right.

195
00:26:04,199 --> 00:26:05,198
Go first.

196
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:12,649
l said, leave.

197
00:26:39,707 --> 00:26:41,456
Stop it, Mr. lguchi!

198
00:26:43,245 --> 00:26:45,743
You said you'd
call me lguchi.

199
00:26:49,614 --> 00:26:50,530
Mr. lguchi.

200
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:53,819
lguchi, right?

201
00:26:56,565 --> 00:26:57,565
Mr. lguchi.

202
00:26:59,229 --> 00:27:00,562
Just lguchi.

203
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,267
Mr. lguchi.

204
00:27:05,723 --> 00:27:07,305
Say, ''lguchi.''

205
00:27:09,262 --> 00:27:10,219
Mr. lguchi.

206
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:12,925
''lguchi.''

207
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:17,087
Mr... lguchi...

208
00:27:18,836 --> 00:27:20,251
No. ''lguchi.''

209
00:27:24,373 --> 00:27:25,247
lguchi...

210
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,117
That's it, Mr. Muto.

211
00:28:12,783 --> 00:28:14,741
What? l touched him!

212
00:28:15,115 --> 00:28:17,904
How can you call it ''safe''?

213
00:28:18,403 --> 00:28:20,735
Damn umpire! Ass!

214
00:28:20,818 --> 00:28:22,524
Open your eyes!

215
00:28:22,733 --> 00:28:24,356
He tagged the runner.

216
00:28:24,938 --> 00:28:26,354
He tagged him here.

217
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,185
Like hell he did!

218
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,017
l saw it.

219
00:28:29,142 --> 00:28:30,558
Know baseball?

220
00:28:30,683 --> 00:28:34,471
He was safe. Safe! Got it?

221
00:28:34,596 --> 00:28:35,928
ldiot umpire!

222
00:28:36,385 --> 00:28:40,049
Never mind.
Quit! l'll make up for it.

223
00:28:40,174 --> 00:28:42,255
That's why you never win!

224
00:28:42,422 --> 00:28:44,753
Forget that ass. Let's start.

225
00:28:45,044 --> 00:28:47,209
''That ass''? Damn you!

226
00:28:52,661 --> 00:28:53,618
Hey, wait!

227
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,815
Go! Go!

228
00:29:38,493 --> 00:29:41,198
About the dress
we saw the other day...

229
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:45,611
Lay off! l told you
l'm broke.

230
00:30:05,841 --> 00:30:08,422
Want to swing
that bat forever?

231
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,794
l'll pinch-hit.

232
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:17,872
All you ever do
is strike out!

233
00:30:19,411 --> 00:30:20,951
l'll get a hit.

234
00:30:23,657 --> 00:30:26,529
Change! Reverse the score!

235
00:30:26,696 --> 00:30:28,069
The last inning.

236
00:30:28,736 --> 00:30:29,860
Get two points.

237
00:30:31,733 --> 00:30:33,273
Get at least two.

238
00:30:34,896 --> 00:30:36,395
Don't bat a foul.

239
00:31:11,111 --> 00:31:11,903
Ass!

240
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:28,886
Get a man on base!

241
00:31:33,132 --> 00:31:34,214
Watch out!

242
00:31:34,381 --> 00:31:35,005
Sorry.

243
00:31:42,831 --> 00:31:44,164
Pick a good ball!

244
00:32:04,185 --> 00:32:05,476
Last inning, two out.

245
00:32:07,349 --> 00:32:08,515
Take a chance!

246
00:32:08,723 --> 00:32:10,554
Wait for a good ball!

247
00:32:10,763 --> 00:32:11,928
Our chance!

248
00:32:24,207 --> 00:32:27,746
lt's our chance.
Get at least one point.

249
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,656
Next batter...?

250
00:32:34,365 --> 00:32:35,364
Kobayashi.

251
00:32:36,029 --> 00:32:38,277
Him? What's he doing?

252
00:32:39,235 --> 00:32:41,149
He's in the can.

253
00:32:41,649 --> 00:32:44,562
The can? What a dunce!

254
00:32:45,978 --> 00:32:48,101
Where's the next batter?

255
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:50,764
ln the can.

256
00:32:51,264 --> 00:32:54,220
Get a pinch-hitter for him.

257
00:32:54,678 --> 00:32:56,551
Pinch-hitter? Who?

258
00:33:01,047 --> 00:33:02,004
l'll do it.

259
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:10,205
Yeah! You.
Swat the first ball.

260
00:33:13,202 --> 00:33:14,700
Let ' em have it!

261
00:33:14,991 --> 00:33:16,032
Swing, okay?

262
00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:10,729
He did it!

263
00:34:58,351 --> 00:35:00,474
Out? What for?

264
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,680
Because you passed him.

265
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:08,756
Why did you? We could've
reversed the score.

266
00:35:10,214 --> 00:35:11,254
Game over.

267
00:35:14,959 --> 00:35:16,790
lt could've been a homer.

268
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:19,955
You did a good job.

269
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:24,283
But you should
never pass a runner.

270
00:35:26,115 --> 00:35:27,406
You were slow.

271
00:35:27,613 --> 00:35:30,486
What? l ran fast.

272
00:35:31,569 --> 00:35:34,691
Just run properly. Ass!

273
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,978
He passed me!

274
00:35:58,334 --> 00:36:03,038
Have the mobsters come
again to your gas station?

275
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,036
They won't.

276
00:36:08,698 --> 00:36:11,071
You're faster
than l thought.

277
00:36:12,569 --> 00:36:14,402
You already laid her?

278
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,480
Aren't you marrying Miki?

279
00:36:20,687 --> 00:36:25,017
What for?
l've got plenty of chicks.

280
00:36:27,265 --> 00:36:28,222
What about you?

281
00:36:30,803 --> 00:36:32,093
l'll marry her.

282
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:35,256
Nonsense!

283
00:36:37,213 --> 00:36:41,833
Your woman came. She's at
the tennis court over there.

284
00:36:50,783 --> 00:36:52,490
You're too fast!

285
00:36:53,281 --> 00:36:55,488
You're too slow!

286
00:36:58,817 --> 00:37:00,024
How silly!

287
00:37:42,816 --> 00:37:43,815
Don't pass me!

288
00:37:46,229 --> 00:37:47,020
Ass!

289
00:37:57,261 --> 00:38:02,630
Dammit, who do you think
you called an ass?!

290
00:38:51,251 --> 00:38:52,166
You dating?

291
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,202
Got laid already?

292
00:39:03,738 --> 00:39:04,737
Where to?

293
00:39:07,567 --> 00:39:08,691
An aquarium.

294
00:39:09,399 --> 00:39:11,813
To see a panda? How nice!

295
00:39:13,479 --> 00:39:16,601
But fishing is even nicer.
Come with me.

296
00:39:44,365 --> 00:39:45,281
Sakaya.

297
00:39:47,404 --> 00:39:49,195
Want to know my name?

298
00:39:51,775 --> 00:39:53,357
lt's James.

299
00:40:02,306 --> 00:40:06,511
No catch. Shall we
go to the aquarium?

300
00:40:20,165 --> 00:40:21,372
How is it?

301
00:40:21,788 --> 00:40:23,203
l did it at last!

302
00:40:25,118 --> 00:40:28,031
lt's that pin.

303
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:29,031
The upper one?

304
00:40:31,611 --> 00:40:32,985
lt's bent.

305
00:40:33,651 --> 00:40:36,315
They pull tricks on you.

306
00:40:37,356 --> 00:40:38,188
l see.

307
00:40:41,394 --> 00:40:42,351
Can't make it.

308
00:40:45,306 --> 00:40:48,221
What's the big idea? Stop!

309
00:40:48,388 --> 00:40:49,511
l need balls.

310
00:40:49,802 --> 00:40:53,299
No. l've lost
10,000 yen already.

311
00:40:54,173 --> 00:40:56,170
You're lying. Ass!

312
00:40:56,629 --> 00:40:58,835
Enough! Stop!

313
00:41:12,072 --> 00:41:13,488
He's sly.

314
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:17,650
From any point of view,
he's richer.

315
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,940
Why take my balls?

316
00:41:33,968 --> 00:41:35,008
Yes?

317
00:41:35,716 --> 00:41:38,005
Balls don't come out.

318
00:41:38,297 --> 00:41:40,337
l'll destroy this shop.

319
00:41:41,669 --> 00:41:43,250
l'll burn it.

320
00:41:44,416 --> 00:41:45,332
Cigarettes.

321
00:41:46,747 --> 00:41:48,620
That'll be 75 balls.

322
00:41:58,028 --> 00:41:59,235
Thank you.

323
00:42:00,193 --> 00:42:01,607
And you?

324
00:42:03,523 --> 00:42:04,314
Gum.

325
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,728
Don't have gum.

326
00:42:05,895 --> 00:42:06,603
None?

327
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:07,893
Sorry.

328
00:42:11,515 --> 00:42:15,386
Hi, players!
Thanks for your patronage.

329
00:42:16,219 --> 00:42:18,384
l have news for you.

330
00:42:20,257 --> 00:42:23,545
You can't win in this dump.

331
00:42:23,836 --> 00:42:26,667
Let's go to another place.

332
00:42:27,999 --> 00:42:32,287
lt's called ''New Prince,''
it's near here.

333
00:42:32,827 --> 00:42:36,574
They're offering
a special discount today.

334
00:42:37,615 --> 00:42:42,277
l repeat, you'll never win
staying in this dump.

335
00:42:42,485 --> 00:42:44,566
Switch to another place.

336
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:52,932
Never come again!

337
00:42:53,141 --> 00:42:54,098
Shut up!

338
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:58,427
l'll make you go bankrupt!

339
00:43:05,213 --> 00:43:06,212
Go first.

340
00:43:12,498 --> 00:43:16,495
Hey, lguchi,
come with us, okay?

341
00:43:17,784 --> 00:43:18,576
Say something?

342
00:43:20,115 --> 00:43:21,364
Come with us.

343
00:43:22,154 --> 00:43:23,195
Before that.

344
00:43:26,567 --> 00:43:27,524
lguchi.

345
00:43:28,565 --> 00:43:29,398
Where's Otomo?

346
00:43:30,439 --> 00:43:31,521
He'll come later.

347
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:35,267
Making me wait?

348
00:43:36,766 --> 00:43:38,889
Shut up, damn you!

349
00:43:40,971 --> 00:43:42,885
You're tough, huh?

350
00:44:06,654 --> 00:44:08,569
Why not straighten out?

351
00:44:11,233 --> 00:44:13,231
Quit acting like a gangster.

352
00:44:18,725 --> 00:44:19,558
See a doc?

353
00:44:20,515 --> 00:44:22,388
He doesn't want to.

354
00:44:24,469 --> 00:44:27,633
He's going to Okinawa
to get a gun.

355
00:44:28,216 --> 00:44:29,340
But he can't move.

356
00:44:30,006 --> 00:44:31,505
He says so.

357
00:44:32,504 --> 00:44:33,503
Stupid!

358
00:44:37,791 --> 00:44:39,622
l'll go to Okinawa.

359
00:44:40,829 --> 00:44:42,786
l'll buy a gun.

360
00:44:43,993 --> 00:44:46,491
Anybody want to
come with me?

361
00:45:08,012 --> 00:45:11,342
What's on your mind?
Going to Okinawa?

362
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:15,629
Keep away from gangsters.

363
00:45:17,917 --> 00:45:18,709
Cancel it.

364
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:25,785
Here. Take it with you.

365
00:46:17,152 --> 00:46:19,983
Got tissue? Tissue!

366
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,231
No.

367
00:46:38,632 --> 00:46:40,423
Wonder how
lguchi's doing...

368
00:46:45,125 --> 00:46:48,205
Shall we go to town
this evening?

369
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:25,504
How much have you embezzled?

370
00:47:27,002 --> 00:47:28,376
A big amount, huh?

371
00:47:31,831 --> 00:47:37,492
Bring the money and one of
your fingers by tomorrow.

372
00:47:40,904 --> 00:47:44,193
Remember, we're taking
care of you.

373
00:47:46,191 --> 00:47:48,564
Aren't you ashamed
of yourself?

374
00:47:49,438 --> 00:47:50,395
Bastard!

375
00:47:54,017 --> 00:47:57,473
What are you going to do

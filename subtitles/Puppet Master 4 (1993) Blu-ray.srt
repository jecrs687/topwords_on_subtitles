1
00:02:16,144 --> 00:02:19,839
It is known
that those in the upworld are

2
00:02:19,864 --> 00:02:22,964
close to discovering our secret--

3
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:28,833
the secret André Toulon stole
from us those many years ago.

4
00:02:29,674 --> 00:02:33,025
We must send our children
to protect it.

5
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:37,710
They will punish those
who try to uncover our world...

6
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:39,943
our secret...

7
00:02:40,575 --> 00:02:42,618
our power.

8
00:03:03,528 --> 00:03:08,472
Those who discover our secret
must be stopped.

9
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:13,555
The power is ours...

10
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:18,047
and ours alone
it must remain.

11
00:05:20,168 --> 00:05:21,709
Well, I'll be damned.

12
00:05:22,123 --> 00:05:23,211
It did it.

13
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:28,474
It works

14
00:05:30,644 --> 00:05:31,646
Yes?

15
00:05:31,671 --> 00:05:34,163
Dr. Piper,
I have a delivery for you down here.

16
00:05:34,517 --> 00:05:36,520
It looks important.
You want me to bring it on up?

17
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,644
Um, sure, Stanley.
That'll be just fine. Thanks.

18
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:40,979
Okey-dokey.

19
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,523
<i>Advanced Technology.</i>

20
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,598
Dr. Baker,
Phoenix Division, please.

21
00:06:01,576 --> 00:06:03,901
- Baker.
- <i>Carl, it's Leslie.</i>

22
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,346
I think we've got a breakthrough
on the Omega Project.

23
00:06:06,371 --> 00:06:07,379
<i>Really?</i>

24
00:06:07,404 --> 00:06:09,993
Well, I've been running some tests
based on our newest data,

25
00:06:10,113 --> 00:06:13,358
and, Carl, it works.
The robots actually solved the problem.

26
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,500
Guess I should've expected this.

27
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:18,681
Jennings was ecstatic with the results
his division's been getting.

28
00:06:18,706 --> 00:06:19,712
Heh.

29
00:06:20,198 --> 00:06:23,424
So, when can we see
the completed prototype?

30
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:26,707
Uh, we're working on that now.
Any news from our boy wonder?

31
00:06:26,732 --> 00:06:29,086
Eh, not since he handed in
that last set of data.

32
00:06:29,111 --> 00:06:30,713
Hm. Well,
it would speed things along

33
00:06:30,738 --> 00:06:32,626
if he could have the sequences
to the next level.

34
00:06:32,651 --> 00:06:35,803
<i>Oh, he's working on it,
but you know how Rick is.</i>

35
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:38,680
Unless he needs some feedback
or some little piece of equipment,

36
00:06:38,705 --> 00:06:40,905
we won't hear from him
'til the problem's solved.

37
00:06:41,059 --> 00:06:42,680
Must be nice to be a wunderkind.

38
00:06:42,705 --> 00:06:43,843
<i>Me, I'm just happy being</i>

39
00:06:43,868 --> 00:06:46,548
a garden-variety
scientist with a job.

40
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,619
You and me both, Carl.

41
00:06:48,744 --> 00:06:49,867
Goodnight.

42
00:07:05,227 --> 00:07:09,082
Thanks, Stanley.
Just put it, I guess, right there.

43
00:07:10,707 --> 00:07:12,531
I'll be closing up soon.

44
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,273
Come on, Doc.
You say that every night.

45
00:07:47,151 --> 00:07:48,931
Ugly little thing, aren't you?

46
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:52,576
Where'd you come from?

47
00:07:58,483 --> 00:07:59,490
Ow!

48
00:08:36,126 --> 00:08:37,316
Come on.

49
00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:42,285
Great. Just great.

50
00:08:55,611 --> 00:08:56,319
Ahh!

51
00:08:58,534 --> 00:08:59,541
Ahh!

52
00:09:03,662 --> 00:09:04,882
Stanley?

53
00:09:07,405 --> 00:09:08,672
Stanley!

54
00:09:09,378 --> 00:09:10,578
Stanley!

55
00:09:14,503 --> 00:09:15,507
Come on.

56
00:09:18,587 --> 00:09:19,820
Stanley!

57
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:20,296
Yes, take her power.
Draw her energy into us.

58
00:11:01,997 --> 00:11:03,002
Hello?

59
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:07,211
Hey, Wonder Woman.
How you doin'?

60
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,887
What a coincidence.
I was just sitting here

61
00:11:08,912 --> 00:11:10,887
with a hot iron in my hand
thinking about you.

62
00:11:11,864 --> 00:11:14,211
No, no.
Just some minor surgery on Hermes.

63
00:11:15,304 --> 00:11:17,169
So, what time are you coming over?

64
00:11:19,557 --> 00:11:23,314
You know, if the storm comes in,
you're gonna have to spend the night.

65
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:24,896
You know that.

66
00:11:25,303 --> 00:11:27,711
Good.
I'll see you later.

67
00:11:30,825 --> 00:11:32,131
Yes!

68
00:11:43,979 --> 00:11:46,625
All right, gentlemen.
You know the rules.

69
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:48,232
I want a good, clean fight.

70
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:50,778
Standing eight counts are mandatory.

71
00:11:50,803 --> 00:11:52,101
No sucker punches.

72
00:11:52,354 --> 00:11:54,238
Now go to your respective corners.

73
00:11:55,755 --> 00:11:58,395
Let's get ready to rumble!

74
00:11:59,788 --> 00:12:01,305
All right.

75
00:12:02,082 --> 00:12:04,159
No more kiddin' around.

76
00:12:14,348 --> 00:12:19,068
Gentlemen, this will be
a random number sequence test

77
00:12:19,093 --> 00:12:24,847
based on the gamma pi
code series 000/3

78
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:28,342
All right.

79
00:12:30,901 --> 00:12:34,031
Gentlemen, don't make me
want to kick your butts.

80
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:38,671
Go!

81
00:12:47,912 --> 00:12:48,932
Alley-oop!

82
00:12:55,897 --> 00:12:57,870
Come on, guys. This is too easy.

83
00:13:08,657 --> 00:13:10,031
And we're down
to the last 30 seconds

84
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:12,948
as Richard Myers continues
to dominate the field.

85
00:13:13,849 --> 00:13:15,401
Wake up, boys!

86
00:13:29,088 --> 00:13:30,788
That was pathetic, guys.

87
00:13:30,841 --> 00:13:34,567
I mean, I'm not a track star
or a basketball player, for Christ's sakes

88
00:13:34,654 --> 00:13:36,001
I'm a scientist.

89
00:13:38,015 --> 00:13:39,328
Not a good one.

90
00:13:42,921 --> 00:13:44,514
Using a random number sequence

91
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:49,018
generated by the gamma pi
code series 000/3

92
00:13:49,098 --> 00:13:52,138
has met with the same results
as in previous trials.

93
00:13:52,605 --> 00:13:56,259
Once again, although the robots
reacted with speed and efficiency...

94
00:13:56,729 --> 00:13:58,287
their behavior was
utterly predictable

95
00:13:58,312 --> 00:14:00,774
and stayed within the parameters
of their programming.

96
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,822
They showed no signs
of initiative or original thought.

97
00:14:05,771 --> 00:14:07,576
We're left no closer
to the creation

98
00:14:07,601 --> 00:14:09,405
of artificial intelligence...

99
00:14:10,176 --> 00:14:11,692
that could stimulate life.

100
00:14:39,108 --> 00:14:40,184
Yes?

101
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:42,995
<i>Sorry to disturb you, Doctor,
but you have a package here.</i>

102
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,614
- What is it?
- <i>I can't tell, sir.</i>

103
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,233
It's a shipping crate.

104
00:14:46,873 --> 00:14:47,980
Bring it up.

105
00:15:20,865 --> 00:15:22,258
He shoots...

106
00:15:22,782 --> 00:15:24,012
he scores.

107
00:15:44,057 --> 00:15:45,313
Hey!

108
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,776
What the hell is this?

109
00:16:43,448 --> 00:16:44,990
Hello, Bodega Bay Inn.

110
00:16:45,015 --> 00:16:46,900
<i>Rick?
This is Dr. Baker.</i>

111
00:16:47,609 --> 00:16:49,655
You didn't send me
anything today, did you?

112
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:52,486
No, sir. There wasn't anything
worth sending today. Why?

113
00:16:53,018 --> 00:16:55,787
Well, I just received
something unusual, that's all.

114
00:16:56,325 --> 00:16:57,984
<i>You know,
everyone in the Phoenix Division is</i>

115
00:16:58,009 --> 00:16:59,523
<i>awaiting your results, Rick.</i>

116
00:16:59,548 --> 00:17:01,470
<i>Uh, when do you think
you'll have something?</i>

117
00:17:02,485 --> 00:17:05,304
Sometimes I feel so close,
I could just taste it, but...

118
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,189
whatever's gonna make the robots
transcend their programming

119
00:17:08,214 --> 00:17:10,492
and think for themselves
just isn't happening.

120
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:14,328
Uh, listen, Doctor,
um, I've gotta go.

121
00:17:14,353 --> 00:17:16,768
There's some clown
outside ringing my doorbell.

122
00:17:17,415 --> 00:17:19,709
- <i>Okay, I'll call you back.</i>
- Okay, Rick.

123
00:17:27,848 --> 00:17:29,295
How'd you get here?

124
00:17:43,973 --> 00:17:45,775
- What?!
- Rick.

125
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,264
- Susie.
- Who were you expecting?

126
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,283
I don't know, sorry.

127
00:17:50,308 --> 00:17:52,042
Some guy was screwing
with my buzzer before.

128
00:17:52,067 --> 00:17:53,073
Oh.

129
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,242
Never mind.

130
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:55,918
I'm glad you're here.

131
00:17:56,069 --> 00:17:58,789
Uh, Rick,
this is my friend, Lauren.

132
00:18:00,082 --> 00:18:02,565
- Oh. Uh, hi.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

133
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,623
You don't mind
that I brought friends, do you?

134
00:18:04,648 --> 00:18:06,442
No. Friends?

135
00:18:06,738 --> 00:18:08,403
Rickster.

136
00:18:08,428 --> 00:18:10,254
Hug, no kiss.

137
00:18:19,013 --> 00:18:20,728
So you two know each other?

138
00:18:20,753 --> 00:18:23,705
Oh, you bet we do.
We go all the way back to the institute.

139
00:18:31,221 --> 00:18:35,143
Susie, how can I begin
to thank you?

140
00:18:35,424 --> 00:18:37,411
What's a place like this doing
out in the sticks, anyway?

141
00:18:37,436 --> 00:18:38,830
Doesn't even look
like it's open.

142
00:18:40,105 --> 00:18:42,679
Actually, it's off season...

143
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,998
and I'm the caretaker.

144
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:48,701
Oh.

145
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,920
So, Mr. Caretaker...

146
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,246
I'm starved.

147
00:18:54,005 --> 00:18:55,136
Where's dinner?

148
00:18:56,088 --> 00:18:57,773
Haven't changed a bit,
have you...

149
00:18:58,087 --> 00:18:59,193
"Cam-ron"?

150
00:20:18,325 --> 00:20:18,818
Ah!

151
00:20:19,411 --> 00:20:22,304
Aah!

152
00:20:27,451 --> 00:20:30,231
- No, that's fire.
- Let's take a vote on it.

153
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,509
There I was
in my senior year,

154
00:20:34,747 --> 00:20:36,884
point of the highest grades
in the school's history,

155
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:37,964
and what happens?

156
00:20:37,989 --> 00:20:39,999
Along comes
little Ricky Myer.

157
00:20:40,024 --> 00:20:41,632
The kid's got
this mega-huge IQ,

158
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:45,396
and in two months he's blown away
every record I ever set.

159
00:20:47,566 --> 00:20:48,780
Great dinner, Rick.

160
00:20:49,286 --> 00:20:50,371
Thank you.

161
00:20:51,009 --> 00:20:53,462
I didn't know I was
gonna be cooking for four.

162
00:20:54,506 --> 00:20:57,363
Suse,
you've barely touched your food.

163
00:20:57,516 --> 00:20:58,518
Are you training again?

164
00:20:58,543 --> 00:21:00,344
I'm always in training.

165
00:21:00,944 --> 00:21:02,679
Susie's incredible.

166
00:21:02,704 --> 00:21:05,812
She's placed in the last
three ironwoman competitions.

167
00:21:05,892 --> 00:21:06,898
Hmm.

168
00:21:07,882 --> 00:21:11,222
Rick,
Lauren's field is metaphysics.

169
00:21:11,247 --> 00:21:12,567
Really? Who with?

170
00:21:12,874 --> 00:21:16,556
I've got a grant from the Hughes
Foundation for Psychic Research.

171
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,297
Uh, this must be
a good up, then.

172
00:21:18,322 --> 00:21:19,798
So, what do you specialize in?

173
00:21:19,823 --> 00:21:21,140
I'm a channeler.

174
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,268
How interesting.

175
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,532
And, naturally,
I'm working on something

176
00:21:26,557 --> 00:21:30,024
that may change the course
of modern civilization as we know it.

177
00:21:30,217 --> 00:21:31,384
Naturally.

178
00:21:31,719 --> 00:21:33,879
Dare I ask
who you're working for?

179
00:21:33,904 --> 00:21:36,348
I doubt you've ever
heard of them before.

180
00:21:36,373 --> 00:21:38,111
I'm working
with the Omega Project.

181
00:21:41,328 --> 00:21:42,738
Sounds interesting.

182
00:21:43,131 --> 00:21:45,753
- Care to talk about it?
- Love to. Classified.

183
00:21:46,168 --> 00:21:48,781
I mean,
I can't tell you much, but...

184
00:21:48,806 --> 00:21:49,549
All right.

185
00:21:51,098 --> 00:21:53,531
I'm working in what's called
the Phoenix Division.

186
00:21:53,671 --> 00:21:56,228
My team logs in data

187
00:21:56,253 --> 00:21:58,680
that's sent over
by some hotshot over at Biotech...

188
00:21:58,915 --> 00:22:00,955
some broad named Pepper.

189
00:22:02,241 --> 00:22:03,814
- Piper.
- What?

190
00:22:04,994 --> 00:22:06,720
Her name is Leslie Piper.

191
00:22:06,974 --> 00:22:08,577
And how would you know that?

192
00:22:09,139 --> 00:22:11,165
Because the work
she's testing is mine.

193
00:22:16,229 --> 00:22:17,646
Great wine, Cam.

194
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:19,449
Cheers.

195
00:22:28,194 --> 00:22:29,634
<i>I am here.</i>

196
00:22:30,413 --> 00:22:32,321
<i>I am with you.</i>

197
00:23:07,649 --> 00:23:10,004
So if you're working
with Baker and Piper,

198
00:23:10,357 --> 00:23:11,799
what're you doing up here?

199
00:23:11,934 --> 00:23:14,261
I needed some place private
where I could spread out and...

200
00:23:14,286 --> 00:23:16,417
not have anyone
looking over my shoulder.

201
00:23:18,248 --> 00:23:20,349
I'd go crazy working in a lab.

202
00:23:20,496 --> 00:23:22,473
And, when I can get him
to come up for air...

203
00:23:23,646 --> 00:23:25,839
this place has
the most heavenly view.

204
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:28,131
Well, then...

205
00:23:28,911 --> 00:23:31,088
how 'bout...
showin' me your set-up?

206
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,640
We are still...

207
00:23:34,665 --> 00:23:35,977
colleagues, right?

208
00:23:39,397 --> 00:23:40,638
Sure, why not?

209
00:23:53,061 --> 00:23:54,462
Rick, I don't mean
to be rude or anything,

210
00:23:54,487 --> 00:23:56,641
but I know Baker
and Piper are paying you money.

211
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:58,480
Maybe you can take some
of that money and we could--

212
00:23:58,505 --> 00:23:59,846
Guys, wait.

213
00:24:03,292 --> 00:24:05,536
- Where'd you find him?
- How cute.

214
00:24:05,722 --> 00:24:07,633
He was down there,
by the table.

215
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:10,159
- What is it, Rick?
- I don't know...

216
00:24:11,434 --> 00:24:13,014
Some kind of mechanical doll.

217
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,895
I found him in my room,
when I moved in.

218
00:24:17,117 --> 00:24:18,815
Come on,
come on, you guys.

219
00:24:20,704 --> 00:24:21,717
Okay.

220
00:24:25,024 --> 00:24:27,587
Rick, how can you pull enough amps
in this place for your set-up?

221
00:24:27,612 --> 00:24:28,920
It's so old.

222
00:24:29,121 --> 00:24:30,675
I've got my own generator.

223
00:24:38,033 --> 00:24:40,486
Hey, hey, hey, now.

224
00:24:41,172 --> 00:24:42,925
This is terrific.

225
00:24:43,897 --> 00:24:44,899
Okay.

226
00:24:44,924 --> 00:24:47,570
Mind if I sprint
through your program here, Ricardo?

227
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,056
I'd rather you didn't.

228
00:24:52,461 --> 00:24:55,948
Come on, it's not
like I'm gonna steal anything.

229
00:24:56,843 --> 00:24:58,296
I'm sure of that.

230
00:24:58,718 --> 00:24:59,819
What's this?

231
00:25:00,273 --> 00:25:01,613
Oh. Um...

232
00:25:02,017 --> 00:25:03,124
It's, uh...

233
00:25:04,882 --> 00:25:06,849
just one of the robots
I've been running tests on.

234
00:25:09,379 --> 00:25:10,386
Hermes.

235
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:34,230
Rick...

236
00:25:34,605 --> 00:25:36,725
do you still have the box
this puppet came in?

237
00:25:38,175 --> 00:25:39,228
Yeah. Um...

238
00:25:39,961 --> 00:25:42,323
Uh, actually,
it's over here.

239
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:47,532
I found it up, uh, here
when I moved my equipment in this room.

240
00:25:58,149 --> 00:25:59,749
No, this can't be right.

241
00:26:01,629 --> 00:26:03,282
This isn't what
the puppet came in.

242
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:04,917
That's where I found it.

243
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:06,910
But that's not
where it belongs.

244
00:26:08,227 --> 00:26:10,026
There's a storage room
down the hall.

245
00:26:10,765 --> 00:26:12,026
Knock yourself out.

246
00:26:49,481 --> 00:26:50,888
Hydraulics, maybe...

247
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,647
or an old-fashioned
wet cell battery.

248
00:26:55,575 --> 00:26:57,790
- Actually, I took a l--
- Oh, my god!

249
00:27:05,711 --> 00:27:08,051
Lauren?
Lauren!

250
00:27:10,746 --> 00:27:11,752
Ohh.

251
00:27:11,892 --> 00:27:13,682
- Hey, is she okay?
- I don't think she's hurt.

252
00:27:13,707 --> 00:27:15,888
She'll be okay.
She just fainted.

253
00:27:16,098 --> 00:27:17,708
This ever happened before?

254
00:27:18,108 --> 00:27:20,670
Yeah, every time I give her
a hot oil massage.

255
00:27:21,292 --> 00:27:22,565
So she's okay?

256
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:24,393
Yeah, she'll be okay.

257
00:27:28,841 --> 00:27:30,249
Stay away from it!

258
00:27:31,541 --> 00:27:32,646
What?

259
00:27:33,449 --> 00:27:35,505
The trunk!
Stay away from the trunk!

260
00:27:36,932 --> 00:27:38,302
What's wrong with the trunk?

261
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,086
That's okay.

262
00:27:43,587 --> 00:27:45,194
No, don't!

263
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,853
Shit!

264
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:54,613
Cameron. Cameron!

265
00:27:54,638 --> 00:27:55,721
What?

266
00:27:55,746 --> 00:27:57,721
Gimme something
to bust open this lock.

267
00:27:58,212 --> 00:28:00,398
Do I look
like Bob Villa to you?

268
00:28:10,174 --> 00:28:11,634
How 'bout this?
Will it help?

269
00:28:12,536 --> 00:28:13,547
Hammer.

270
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,087
<i>Guten</i> idea.

271
00:28:29,231 --> 00:28:30,672
Any plastic explosives?

272
00:28:30,696 --> 00:28:33,459
Yeah. I keep 'em right next
to my Scud missiles.

273
00:28:33,484 --> 00:28:35,057
What're you doing?

274
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,813
- Would you stop it?
- Hey, it's a fifty-year-old trunk.

275
00:28:37,838 --> 00:28:39,345
He's not gonna ruin it.

276
00:28:39,609 --> 00:28:42,154
- Please.
- Lauren, what happened to you?

277
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,614
Hey, let me take
a whack at that. Come on.

278
00:28:45,984 --> 00:28:46,991
Come on.

279
00:28:58,099 --> 00:28:59,779
Stop it, Cameron.

280
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:03,431
Not until I see what's
inside this fucking thing.

281
00:29:03,644 --> 00:29:06,356
Lauren's terrified of that trunk, Cam,
or don't you care?

282
00:29:08,306 --> 00:29:10,374
Yes, of course I care.

283
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:11,273
Lauren...

284
00:29:12,886 --> 00:29:14,914
what the fuck are you
so scared of?

285
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:19,130
I just can't stand here
and watch you guys do this.

286
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:22,507
Hey.
People are afraid of the unknown.

287
00:29:22,782 --> 00:29:25,029
When she sees there's nothing bad inside,
she'll be fine.

288
00:29:25,182 --> 00:29:28,001
You guys play macho.
I'm taking Lauren into your room.

289
00:29:29,916 --> 00:29:30,949
Wait, Suzie?

290
00:29:32,931 --> 00:29:34,044
Women...

291
00:29:34,069 --> 00:29:35,383
can't live with 'em...

292
00:29:36,056 --> 00:29:37,249
can't shoot 'em.

293
00:29:40,666 --> 00:29:42,119
<i>I am here.</i>

294
00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:55,300
Whoa.

295
00:30:00,055 --> 00:30:02,095
Concentrated muriatic acid.

296
00:30:02,556 --> 00:30:03,763
Yeah, and what do you want me
to do with it?

297
00:30:03,788 --> 00:30:06,263
- Don't touch it.
- Jesus.

298
00:30:17,806 --> 00:30:19,392
It should be loose now.

299
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:24,318
- <i>Voilà.</i>
- Okay.

300
00:30:25,104 --> 00:30:26,611
Okay. Let's open it.

301
00:30:30,114 --> 00:30:31,121
Wow!

302
00:30:31,399 --> 00:30:34,339
- Jesus.
- Look at those.

303
00:30:47,031 --> 00:30:48,217
Cool, huh?

304
00:30:56,068 --> 00:30:57,494
I'm a little disappointed.

305
00:30:57,862 --> 00:30:59,828
I was hoping
we'd find L. Ron Hubbard.

306
00:31:01,471 --> 00:31:03,238
Well, we found something.

307
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:07,735
Jesus.

308
00:31:08,515 --> 00:31:10,362
- What?
- Look at who owned this.

309
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:14,378
A Nazi?

310
00:31:15,767 --> 00:31:17,488
I hate those guys.

311
00:31:22,029 --> 00:31:23,042
Here,
take a look at this.

312
00:31:24,635 --> 00:31:26,515
Looks like some kind
of a game board.

313
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:30,083
See, the trunk's not evil.
It just belonged to some evil guy.

314
00:31:32,772 --> 00:31:34,926
It looks like a Ouija board.
I used to one have when I was a kid.

315
00:31:35,273 --> 00:31:37,041
Except the markings are
a little different.

316
00:31:40,327 --> 00:31:42,968
Maybe there's something
about it in this diary.

317
00:31:52,654 --> 00:31:53,674
Listen to this:

318
00:31:56,149 --> 00:31:57,737
"With the death of Krauss,

319
00:31:57,762 --> 00:32:00,450
"the murder of my beloved Elsa
has been avenged.

320
00:32:01,097 --> 00:32:05,088
"For the moment, the secret
of my magic and my puppets is safe.

321
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:07,926
"I must escape Germany
before the Gestapo finds me

322
00:32:07,951 --> 00:32:10,252
"and the formula falls
into the wrong hands.

323
00:32:10,707 --> 00:32:14,235
"Von Kersting, the printer,
will forge me a passport."

324
00:32:15,947 --> 00:32:17,814
So this Toulon wasn't a Nazi.

325
00:32:17,854 --> 00:32:19,469
The Nazis were after him.

326
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:23,688
They wanted to know
how he animated his puppets...

327
00:32:23,887 --> 00:32:28,231
and he was afraid of what
they'd do with that power.

328
00:32:28,961 --> 00:32:29,968
Duh.

329
00:32:39,551 --> 00:32:41,518
There you are,
Uncle Fester.

330
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:42,991
Looks like you, Cam.

331
00:32:50,213 --> 00:32:51,652
His name is Pinhead.

332
00:32:55,725 --> 00:32:56,838
That's Tunneler.

333
00:32:58,983 --> 00:33:01,343
Yeah, e's Six Shooter.
Appropriate enough.

334
00:33:03,738 --> 00:33:05,043
That's cute.

335
00:33:25,584 --> 00:33:26,644
What do you think this is?

336
00:33:33,233 --> 00:33:35,413
Maybe this is the formula
Toulon wrote about.

337
00:33:35,993 --> 00:33:38,667
Wait a minute.
How can liquid animate these guys?

338
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,573
Maybe they just need a little gas.

339
00:33:59,423 --> 00:34:00,903
Come on, come on.

340
00:35:04,113 --> 00:35:06,234
This is so stimulating.

341
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:08,108
Somebody pinch me.

342
00:35:12,398 --> 00:35:13,468
Get it off me, man!

343
00:35:13,493 --> 00:35:14,704
Let go of me.

344
00:35:23,745 --> 00:35:26,656
- Cameron!
- Oh, hey, wait! Don't! Don't! Don't!

345
00:35:42,926 --> 00:35:44,853
I warned you guys.

346
00:35:45,323 --> 00:35:47,023
Let's just wait. Just wait.

347
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,346
They're amazing.

348
00:35:57,473 --> 00:35:59,274
- Shit!
- Cameron, don't do that.

349
00:35:59,299 --> 00:36:01,474
I don't think they want you
getting personal, Cam.

350
00:36:02,533 --> 00:36:04,753
Ho, whoa, easy there, Tex.

351
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:13,187
He wants me
to pick him up.

352
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,334
Hi, bud.

353
00:36:48,222 --> 00:36:50,049
They're responding spontaneously.

354
00:36:50,826 --> 00:36:55,665
No. No way that a toymaker 50 years ago
figured out how to do this, no.

355
00:36:56,928 --> 00:36:58,561
Do you realize
what this means?

356
00:36:59,628 --> 00:37:03,638
That puppet master guy may have had
the answer to the entire Omega Project.

357
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,454
Everything we've been
working for could be standing...

358
00:37:09,476 --> 00:37:10,527
right here.

359
00:37:21,343 --> 00:37:24,537
What Toulon stole from me...

360
00:37:29,697 --> 00:37:32,023
we must recover.

361
00:37:32,129 --> 00:37:34,453
Everyone around him...

362
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:36,146
must die.

363
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:40,629
They must die, die, die.

364
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,263
Listen to this.

365
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:48,581
"I'm making that,
which is inanimate, animate.

366
00:37:48,606 --> 00:37:51,746
"The metaphysical ramifications
of this stirs my soul.

367
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:53,607
"To be as God,
a creator of un--

368
00:37:53,632 --> 00:37:57,174
Eh, this is a personal journal.
There's no formula in here.

369
00:37:57,633 --> 00:37:59,253
Well, it must be
in there somewhere.

370
00:38:01,308 --> 00:38:03,873
Okay, here you go,
little guy.

371
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,514
It's not!
I'm telling you.

372
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:13,639
I've looked 50 times through this
whole thing, and it's not in here.

373
00:38:13,664 --> 00:38:15,717
Come on,
just use your imagination.

374
00:38:16,448 --> 00:38:18,469
Look for something
that might be a code...

375
00:38:19,368 --> 00:38:20,715
a clue.

376
00:38:24,596 --> 00:38:25,616
Think about it...

377
00:38:26,498 --> 00:38:28,642
the secret
to artificial intelligence.

378
00:38:29,452 --> 00:38:30,457
Fine.

379
00:38:30,592 --> 00:38:32,663
If you're so sure
that the formula's in here,

380
00:38:32,688 --> 00:38:36,801
why don't you use your bigger-than-huge,
mega-superior imagination IQ

381
00:38:36,826 --> 00:38:38,243
to find it?!

382
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,289
Will you guys grow up?

383
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,646
Dammit!
Not again.

384
00:38:51,181 --> 00:38:53,641
Swell. Mood lighting.

385
00:38:54,553 --> 00:38:56,282
The lightning knocked out
the power.

386
00:38:56,921 --> 00:38:58,890
It'll take a while
before it comes back up.

387
00:38:59,035 --> 00:39:00,650
Don't you have a generator?

388
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,804
Yeah. It's hooked up to my computers.

389
00:39:06,317 --> 00:39:07,331
Oh...

390
00:39:07,496 --> 00:39:08,503
Wait...

391
00:39:09,289 --> 00:39:12,182
You're telling me that this is
the only light we have?

392
00:39:12,807 --> 00:39:13,746
What'd you mean, "we"?

393
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:15,569
Your room...

394
00:39:16,208 --> 00:39:17,680
is downstairs.

395
00:39:18,929 --> 00:39:20,789
Guys, why don't we
call it a night?

396
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:25,769
Yeah, okay, fine, good.
Um...

397
00:39:25,916 --> 00:39:27,088
Lauren, honey?

398
00:39:27,635 --> 00:39:29,226
I think you need your rest.

399
00:39:29,374 --> 00:39:30,566
'Night, you guys.

400
00:39:32,538 --> 00:39:33,573
Goodnight.

401
00:39:34,919 --> 00:39:36,923
He got awfully sweet
all of a sudden.

402
00:39:41,938 --> 00:39:42,951
Hmm.

403
00:39:43,152 --> 00:39:44,785
I should be so lucky.

404
00:39:51,955 --> 00:39:52,961
No!

405
00:39:53,462 --> 00:39:56,235
- Dammit!
- Just don't worry about it, okay?

406
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,020
Besides, you always take
everything so personally.

407
00:40:01,045 --> 00:40:02,335
Personally?

408
00:40:02,974 --> 00:40:04,781
"Use your imagination"?

409
00:40:04,981 --> 00:40:08,000
Fuck him!
We all can't be child fucking prodigies.

410
00:40:08,025 --> 00:40:09,381
Some of us have
to settle for being

411
00:40:09,406 --> 00:40:12,644
ordinary, typical run-of-the-mill-type
geniuses who have to work for a living!

412
00:40:13,268 --> 00:40:14,275
Cammie...

413
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,609
I mean, who does that little prick
sack of shit think he is?

414
00:40:16,863 --> 00:40:21,126
And he thinks he's
so fucking smart!

415
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:24,665
I don't think he means it.

416
00:40:27,681 --> 00:40:29,688
Well, he won't let me
look at any of his data.

417
00:40:29,713 --> 00:40:32,661
Practically accused
me of planning to steal it.

418
00:40:32,927 --> 00:40:34,068
He never said that.

419
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:38,476
You know what I'm gonna do?

420
00:40:41,015 --> 00:40:46,614
I'm gonna find the secret
to those little swine-puppets.

421
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:50,144
The answer's gotta be in the formula.

422
00:40:51,798 --> 00:40:52,925
Then...

423
00:40:53,038 --> 00:40:54,938
I'm gonna take it to Omega.

424
00:40:58,530 --> 00:40:59,670
And then...

425
00:41:00,076 --> 00:41:01,083
Baker...

426
00:41:01,663 --> 00:41:06,666
and Piper, and all the rest of them
are gonna have to kiss my ass.

427
00:41:07,252 --> 00:41:09,212
But those puppets
don't belong to you.

428
00:41:09,237 --> 00:41:13,289
Bullshit. Rick's had 'em lying around here
for months. He's hardly even touched 'em.

429
00:41:13,314 --> 00:41:14,881
I mean, you're the one
that kept asking about 'em.

430
00:41:14,906 --> 00:41:17,682
You're the one
that found the right box.

431
00:41:17,707 --> 00:41:19,595
If it wasn't for your gifts...

432
00:41:22,056 --> 00:41:23,978
he'd still think
they were just...

433
00:41:24,499 --> 00:41:25,612
dolls.

434
00:41:29,116 --> 00:41:30,856
He's been laughing at you...

435
00:41:31,636 --> 00:41:32,860
all night...

436
00:41:34,421 --> 00:41:35,914
and me, too.

437
00:41:42,556 --> 00:41:44,878
Don't you wanna help me
get what I deserve?

438
00:41:46,064 --> 00:41:47,204
How?

439
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,377
This.

440
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:24,188
Okay, guys,
let's see what you can do.

441
00:42:35,139 --> 00:42:36,159
What're you doing?

442
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:41,983
Not every scientist adheres
to standard methodology.

443
00:42:42,123 --> 00:42:43,423
Oh, really?

444
00:42:43,448 --> 00:42:47,244
And what is your methodology,
Professor Myers?

445
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:52,763
Well,
the standard litmus test...

446
00:42:53,293 --> 00:42:54,807
tends to be...

447
00:42:55,859 --> 00:42:57,173
is it fun?

448
00:43:03,221 --> 00:43:05,870
All, right. I can hear you, guys.
Stop your mumbling.

449
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:09,382
No ganging up.
Every man for himself... or puppet.

450
00:43:10,864 --> 00:43:12,017
Okay, guys.

451
00:43:13,965 --> 00:43:15,065
Ready?

452
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,450
On three.

453
00:43:17,924 --> 00:43:18,977
One...

454
00:43:19,543 --> 00:43:20,596
two...

455
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:22,569
three!

456
00:43:27,057 --> 00:43:28,063
Oh!

457
00:43:28,656 --> 00:43:29,663
Not bad!

458
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:33,308
Lauren...
you can do this.

459
00:43:33,428 --> 00:43:36,523
I know I can.
I just don't want to.

460
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,859
All I want...

461
00:43:39,864 --> 00:43:41,887
is to talk
to this Toulon guy.

462
00:43:41,912 --> 00:43:43,527
And I don't.

463
00:43:44,087 --> 00:43:47,886
Look, you don't know the forces
we'd be summoning here.

464
00:43:50,643 --> 00:43:54,527
If you could've felt
the intensity of evil I sensed here...

465
00:43:54,766 --> 00:43:58,893
Lauren,
the only evil is in your mind.

466
00:43:59,536 --> 00:44:01,138
I thought
you believed in me.

467
00:44:01,304 --> 00:44:03,030
I do believe in you.

468
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:06,452
I do.
That's why I want you to do this thing.

469
00:44:07,935 --> 00:44:09,229
Come on.

470
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:12,703
<i>Por favore.</i>

471
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:15,470
<i>Por favore.</i>

472
00:44:25,058 --> 00:44:26,078
Okay.

473
00:44:26,771 --> 00:44:28,091
Okay!

474
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:44,561
Fast, huh?

475
00:44:47,583 --> 00:44:48,996
Get the door!
Someone's at the door!

476
00:44:49,396 --> 00:44:50,402
Okay.

477
00:44:52,174 --> 00:44:54,611
Whoo! Damn!
Damn!

478
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:11,160
Hello?

479
00:45:26,918 --> 00:45:28,559
Whoo, wow!

480
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:36,171
Bam!

481
00:45:40,194 --> 00:45:41,981
Sure, I'll come and find out!

482
00:46:30,057 --> 00:46:31,064
Lauren?

483
00:46:31,227 --> 00:46:32,237
Lauren?

484
00:46:32,297 --> 00:46:33,638
Lauren, what's going on?

485
00:46:33,663 --> 00:46:35,091
- Oh!
- Talk to me.

486
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:37,388
- Oh!
- Shit!

487
00:46:40,754 --> 00:46:42,934
Sweetie, you all right?

488
00:46:44,638 --> 00:46:46,979
Whom do you seek?

489
00:46:48,987 --> 00:46:49,995
Um...

490
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:52,729
Whom do you seek?

491
00:46:53,984 --> 00:46:55,895
Toulon.
André Toulon.

492
00:46:57,804 --> 00:47:01,057
Ah, the puppet master.

493
00:47:04,299 --> 00:47:07,561
And what do you seek
to learn?

494
00:47:09,001 --> 00:47:10,594
The formula?

495
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:13,264
The elixir.

496
00:47:14,091 --> 00:47:16,515
Yes, the elixir.

497
00:47:17,112 --> 00:47:20,176
The secret is
within the pyramid.

498
00:47:21,895 --> 00:47:23,295
What does that mean?

499
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,271
Listen, and you will learn.

500
00:47:46,695 --> 00:47:47,738
Shit!

501
00:47:49,311 --> 00:47:51,209
What the fuck is that?!

502
00:47:54,507 --> 00:47:56,507
Lauren? Honey?
I think it's working.

503
00:47:59,493 --> 00:48:00,506
Oh, my god!

504
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:03,332
Aah, fuck!

505
00:48:06,975 --> 00:48:08,148
Cameron!

506
00:48:17,874 --> 00:48:19,289
You guys give up yet?

507
00:48:24,873 --> 00:48:25,913
Rick.

508
00:48:33,534 --> 00:48:34,297
Rick.

509
00:48:36,777 --> 00:48:39,035
- What's wrong?
- Listen.

510
00:48:40,461 --> 00:48:41,521
What?

511
00:48:42,859 --> 00:48:44,713
- That.
- Shit.

512
00:48:46,152 --> 00:48:47,159
Come on.

513
00:48:55,434 --> 00:48:57,727
You guys, we gotta get out.
There's something evil in here.

514
00:48:57,752 --> 00:49:00,163
- Fuckin' A-right, there is.
- Yeah, I'm terrified.

515
00:49:00,188 --> 00:49:01,402
Where you going?

516
00:49:01,426 --> 00:49:02,990
I'm gonna go see what's up.

517
00:49:18,785 --> 00:49:21,118
Psychic... next.

518
00:49:36,066 --> 00:49:37,553
Did you guys come here
to protect me?

519
00:49:45,036 --> 00:49:46,046
Thanks.

520
00:49:56,373 --> 00:49:59,280
Shit!
Fuck this thing.

521
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,497
Wait!
Why don't you tell me what happened?

522
00:50:02,522 --> 00:50:04,034
I'll fax you, babe.

523
00:50:04,367 --> 00:50:05,642
You and Rick can't stay here.

524
00:50:05,667 --> 00:50:07,986
- I can't make him leave.
- Then it's his goddamn funeral.

525
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:10,335
If you wanna come with us,
that's fine, let's go.

526
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,273
If not,
I'm taking the goddamn keys.

527
00:50:13,665 --> 00:50:16,515
Hey, Cam...
when did you start carrying a purse?

528
00:50:16,581 --> 00:50:17,710
Fuck you, Myers.

529
00:50:17,735 --> 00:50:19,683
You wanna commit suicide,
that's okay with me,

530
00:50:19,714 --> 00:50:22,016
but I am gone.

531
00:50:26,424 --> 00:50:28,158
Suse, come on.

532
00:50:30,084 --> 00:50:32,063
You guys are
in real danger here.

533
00:50:33,221 --> 00:50:34,658
Thanks for the warning.

534
00:50:37,739 --> 00:50:39,566
Sorry about the evil spirits.

535
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:44,059
Nice girl...

536
00:50:44,952 --> 00:50:46,296
for a psychic.

537
00:50:59,552 --> 00:51:00,559
Go!

538
00:51:04,147 --> 00:51:05,493
Get out and push.

539
00:51:06,382 --> 00:51:07,462
What?

540
00:51:07,968 --> 00:51:09,878
Get out of the car
and push!

541
00:51:10,325 --> 00:51:11,018
No!

542
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:13,948
Lauren, get out of the car
and push!

543
00:51:13,973 --> 00:51:15,137
Let's go. Come on!

544
00:51:15,998 --> 00:51:17,008
Fine.

545
00:51:22,926 --> 00:51:24,250
Open the door!

546
00:51:26,038 --> 00:51:28,260
Open the door!
Cameron!

547
00:51:29,222 --> 00:51:30,944
Open the door!

548
00:51:31,831 --> 00:51:33,132
Cameron!

549
00:51:35,811 --> 00:51:37,530
What in the fuck is this thing?!

550
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:27,850
Oh, god!

551
00:53:05,003 --> 00:53:07,058
- What the hell is this?
- Oh, my god.

552
00:53:07,858 --> 00:53:09,328
I didn't open it.

553
00:53:09,634 --> 00:53:11,235
It was downstairs
at the front door.

554
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:14,231
I brought it up
when you were working on the puppets.

555
00:53:18,233 --> 00:53:20,465
- Susie? Susie!
- Lauren!

556
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:21,974
It got him.

557
00:53:21,999 --> 00:53:24,013
- It got Cammie.
- What are you talking about?

558
00:53:24,038 --> 00:53:25,974
- It was in the car with him.
- What got him?

559
00:53:25,999 --> 00:53:27,245
He locked the door.

560
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:29,067
- He locked it in with him.
- Okay, sit down.

561
00:53:29,092 --> 00:53:33,310
He got him. He go--
He got him. He got him.

562
00:53:35,508 --> 00:53:37,008
Okay, I'm gonna check it out.

563
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:52,967
It's all my fault.

564
00:54:00,935 --> 00:54:02,401
Cameron!

565
00:54:03,248 --> 00:54:05,235
Cameron,
can you hear me?!

566
00:54:25,955 --> 00:54:27,448
Get away from me!

567
00:56:00,696 --> 00:56:02,436
No!

568
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:18,464
<i>My friends,
I am with you.</i>

569
00:56:18,623 --> 00:56:20,417
<i>The magic must prevail.</i>

570
00:56:20,963 --> 00:56:23,917
<i>Decapitron...
his time has come.</i>

571
00:56:45,856 --> 00:56:48,602
Ugh.
A little rumble, huh, guys?

572
00:56:50,971 --> 00:56:52,238
Blech.

573
00:57:02,587 --> 00:57:03,867
Way to go, Tunneler.

574
00:57:10,697 --> 00:57:11,740
Shoots...

575
00:57:13,937 --> 00:57:15,272
he scores.

576
00:57:19,786 --> 00:57:20,795
Susie?

577
00:57:21,634 --> 00:57:22,763
Can she walk?

578
00:57:22,788 --> 00:57:25,114
I doubt it.
She could remember then.

579
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:26,670
Where's Cameron?

580
00:57:28,964 --> 00:57:31,097
- We gotta get her out of here.
- What happened to your arm?

581
00:57:32,113 --> 00:57:32,945
Come on, we gotta go!

582
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:42,815
Look.
What are they doing?

583
00:59:04,248 --> 00:59:06,371
Exactly.
The storm.

584
00:59:08,922 --> 00:59:10,450
They're using the power
from the storm.

585
01:00:02,484 --> 01:00:03,490
Shit!

586
01:00:10,077 --> 01:00:11,217
Susie!

587
01:00:13,867 --> 01:00:15,991
Lauren!
Lauren, don't!

588
01:00:28,072 --> 01:00:29,079
Let's go!

589
01:00:44,446 --> 01:00:45,607
Go!
Go, go, go, go, go!

590
01:01:01,719 --> 01:01:02,823
Come on.

591
01:03:04,018 --> 01:03:05,618
I am with you.

592
01:03:10,361 --> 01:03:12,697
The magic that gives
my puppets life...

593
01:03:12,728 --> 01:03:15,555
was stolen from a tribe
of ancient Egyptian sorcerers...

594
01:03:16,109 --> 01:03:19,210
who pledged their allegiance
to the demon lord Sutekh.

595
01:03:19,476 --> 01:03:22,167
He and his watchers--
his followers--

596
01:03:22,192 --> 01:03:24,598
will stop at nothing
to guard their secrets.

597
01:03:24,877 --> 01:03:28,589
They are committed to your death
and the deaths of all your followers.

598
01:03:29,275 --> 01:03:30,624
Project Omega.

599
01:03:30,649 --> 01:03:32,428
You have discovered the magic.

600
01:03:32,454 --> 01:03:34,202
Use it to protect yourself.

601
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:36,365
- Guard the secret.
- What secret?

602
01:03:36,744 --> 01:03:38,866
- The frequency.
- Wait, wait! What-What frequency?

603
01:03:39,333 --> 01:03:42,150
Numeric sequence.
The energy of life.

604
01:03:42,175 --> 01:03:43,083
You are very close.

605
01:03:44,669 --> 01:03:46,703
The magic is in the formula.

606
01:03:54,939 --> 01:03:56,148
Where is it?

607
01:03:56,173 --> 01:03:58,115
The vial...
the rest of the formula?

608
01:03:58,140 --> 01:03:59,431
Have you guys seen it?

609
01:04:03,545 --> 01:04:04,745
Cameron.

610
01:04:18,512 --> 01:04:19,338
Lauren?

611
01:04:19,822 --> 01:04:20,982
Lauren!

612
01:04:39,890 --> 01:04:41,410
Stay away from me.

613
01:05:12,970 --> 01:05:15,556
- Oh! God! Oh, god, you're okay!
- I guess.

614
01:05:15,581 --> 01:05:17,832
- What happened? What happened?
- Slow down. Slow down. Slow down.

615
01:05:17,857 --> 01:05:18,767
Where's Lauren?

616
01:05:18,792 --> 01:05:20,304
Rick,
I'm really scared. I can't find her.

617
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,689
She'll be okay.

618
01:05:22,295 --> 01:05:23,509
I got the sequence!

619
01:05:23,533 --> 01:05:24,473
What--
What do you mean?

620
01:05:24,498 --> 01:05:26,806
The sequence-- the numeric sequence.
Toulon spoke to me.

621
01:05:27,907 --> 01:05:29,733
Okay. Go up to the attic.
The puppets are there.

622
01:05:29,758 --> 01:05:30,762
- Okay?
- Okay.

623
01:05:30,787 --> 01:05:33,090
- Wait. Where are you going?
- I'll be back in a minute.

624
01:05:47,203 --> 01:05:48,917
Get off her, you little bastard!

625
01:06:04,617 --> 01:06:05,782
Come on!

626
01:06:13,802 --> 01:06:14,815
Oh, my god.

627
01:06:15,768 --> 01:06:18,410
Come on, you little bastard.
Come on.

628
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:20,197
Come on!

629
01:06:32,403 --> 01:06:33,849
Oh, shit!

630
01:07:18,651 --> 01:07:19,951
Come on.

631
01:07:39,798 --> 01:07:41,518
What happened?
Is she hurt?

632
01:07:41,798 --> 01:07:44,474
No, but she was attacked.
I had to kill it.

633
01:07:44,499 --> 01:07:46,823
- How many more could there be?
- You're bleeding.

634
01:07:47,643 --> 01:07:50,004
I'm okay...
but I'm not so sure about Lauren.

635
01:07:58,911 --> 01:08:02,976
Rick Myers,
you must animate the Decapitron.

636
01:08:03,523 --> 01:08:04,556
Lauren?

637
01:08:07,177 --> 01:08:08,197
Who are you?

638
01:08:08,488 --> 01:08:10,398
The puppet master.

639
01:08:12,661 --> 01:08:13,708
Is this the answer?

640
01:08:14,248 --> 01:08:16,791
The Omega Project-- this is
what I've been searching for, right?

641
01:08:16,816 --> 01:08:19,540
Only the Decapitron can
defeat the beast.

642
01:08:19,854 --> 01:08:21,833
Create an electrical field.

643
01:08:22,366 --> 01:08:25,218
The formula will generate
the projections.

644
01:08:25,266 --> 01:08:27,858
Projections? You mean--
You mean linear projections?

645
01:08:28,789 --> 01:08:30,724
My god,
that's what I've been experimenting with.

646
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:33,827
You must transcend linearity.

647
01:08:54,834 --> 01:08:56,776
And that's the fifth button
from the top.

648
01:09:09,592 --> 01:09:11,508
Okay.
Let's boost the generator.

649
01:09:23,806 --> 01:09:25,135
Come on,
come on, come on!

650
01:09:26,513 --> 01:09:30,238
I'm back.
Puppet, don't hold back.

651
01:09:37,047 --> 01:09:38,139
Showtime.

652
01:09:40,454 --> 01:09:41,734
Come on!

653
01:09:43,018 --> 01:09:44,024
Yes!

654
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:47,037
All right, guys.

655
01:09:49,678 --> 01:09:50,778
On your marks...

656
01:09:52,136 --> 01:09:55,101
Ten, nine, eight...

657
01:09:55,134 --> 01:09:58,171
seven, six, five...

658
01:09:58,291 --> 01:10:00,410
four, three...

659
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:02,434
one...

660
01:10:02,459 --> 01:10:03,623
Now!

661
01:11:34,402 --> 01:11:35,409
Shit!

662
01:11:37,295 --> 01:11:38,355
Lauren!

663
01:11:43,549 --> 01:11:44,509
Stay back.

664
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,562
Come on!

665
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:01,207
No!

666
01:12:05,987 --> 01:12:06,847
Come on!

667
01:12:31,535 --> 01:12:32,834
No, no!

668
01:12:43,578 --> 01:12:45,238
Oh, come on!

669
01:12:45,424 --> 01:12:46,431
No!

670
01:12:49,051 --> 01:12:51,284
Shit! I thought you just
killed that little shit!

671
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:52,993
I thought I did!

672
01:12:59,002 --> 01:13:00,008
Shit!

673
01:13:04,724 --> 01:13:05,754
Yes!

674
01:13:11,937 --> 01:13:13,057
Oh, yeah!

675
01:13:17,762 --> 01:13:18,768
Yeah!

676
01:13:19,416 --> 01:13:20,716
That's it, come on.

677
01:13:23,467 --> 01:13:24,226
Yeah!

678
01:13:24,251 --> 01:13:25,460
Oh, no!

679
01:13:36,401 --> 01:13:38,397
Go! Go!

680
01:13:38,997 --> 01:13:41,567
- Come on! Come on!
- Do it!

681
01:14:17,857 --> 01:14:19,816
Susie? Susie!

682
01:14:21,377 --> 01:14:22,384
Lauren?

683
01:14:28,723 --> 01:14:30,282
Lauren, answer me.

684
01:14:39,146 --> 01:14:40,848
Let's get her outta here.

685
01:14:57,867 --> 01:15:00,098
The power of the magic
has been set free.

686
01:15:00,642 --> 01:15:03,872
It now needs a wise master
to channel and control it...

687
01:15:03,897 --> 01:15:05,239
to keep it from evil.

688
01:15:05,982 --> 01:15:08,017
You have been chosen,
Richard Myers.

689
01:15:08,744 --> 01:15:11,898
Protect the magic
from those who seek to abuse it.

690
01:15:12,445 --> 01:15:14,527
It is time to begin anew.

691
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:17,868
I am with you,
Puppet Master.

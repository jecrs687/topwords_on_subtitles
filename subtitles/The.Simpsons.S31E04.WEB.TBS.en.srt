_

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,679
Come on. One more long one

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,222
and we can get this thing done.

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,639
Congratulations! It's a boy.

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,814
- _
- What?

7
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:25,233
Another boy? Plus Bart?

8
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:28,299
That's like introducing
Frankenstein to Dracula.

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,479
- _
- Or Cheney to Bush.

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,319
Or Ben Affleck to anybody.

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,299
Hmm. Well, this is unorthodox, but, uh,

12
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,245
what would you think about
taking a cute baby girl instead?

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,259
Her mother died in childbirth.

14
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,819
The, uh, father is listed
as 10,000 lunatics,

15
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,659
but, uh, none of them has shown up yet.

16
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,279
- Sold.
- I should warn you, however.

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,719
We ran the standard
newborn screen on her,

18
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,670
and, uh, she tested positive

19
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:54,178
for evil.

20
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,909
_

21
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,605
Still better than a boy.

22
00:01:03,606 --> 00:01:05,019
Maggie darling,

23
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:08,279
these stuffed animals are
your fuzzy new friends.

24
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,029
And here's baby's first music box.

25
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,779
The cow says...

26
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,334
your mother dates jocks in hell.

27
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:27,739
Aw, Nemo's just like you.

28
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,989
His mommy died at the beginning, too.

29
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,008
Yes, she did.

30
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,539
"Omen"!

31
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,680
_

32
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,979
Palindrome!

33
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,010
Callback!

34
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:44,819
I'm beginning to wonder
if trading for this baby

35
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,049
of unknown origin was
the right thing to do.

36
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,193
Marge, I fed the baby!

37
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:52,179
_

38
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,204
The baby is making us kill ourselves.

39
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:04,569
I thought this suicide was
just gonna be the two of us.

40
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,119
We'll figure it out in hell!

41
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,449
Oh, I must stop this spawn of Satan.

42
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,053
But can I really find it in
my heart to kill a child?

43
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,899
I like Morrissey.

44
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,680
Reality bites.

45
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:25,770
Looks like I'll be digging three graves.

46
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,850
Ned, stop!

47
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,987
It must be killed. It bears
the mark of the beast.

48
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:38,970
Sorry, not that one.

49
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,480
What do we do? What do we do?

50
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,219
Still better than a boy.

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:59,304

58
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:37,559
My mom won't let me see the movie

59
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,170
'cause she thinks the
scientists will scare me.

61
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,010
We'd better go.

62

Parachute pants, activate.

63
00:03:57,696 --> 00:04:00,114
Smell ya later.

Dang. I never get to
finish my "Safely" song.

68
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,579
Luann! I need extra
cards for my Rolodex!

69
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:32,119
As a yuppie, I'm making
lots more friends.

70
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,959
Milhouse still isn't home.

71
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,651
And it's 2:00 in the morning.

72
00:04:35,652 --> 00:04:37,859
My Swatch watch says 7:30.

73
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,519
Uh, see? Squiggle hand is
just past the kissy lips.

74
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,399
Wait, no, that's the zigzag hand.

75
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,619
The zig... the zigzag hand?!

76
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,749
Milhouse, where are you?

77
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,579
Oh, come on.

78
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,959
Maybe he's in this wall.

79
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,909
Kirk, you're going crazy.

80
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,419
Crazy?! Am I?!

81
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,499
Does this look crazy to you, Luann?

82
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,579
Does this?

83
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,602
Your friend's bike crashed here.

84
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:12,659
We found his inhaler here.

85
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,550
And over here is his final pee stain.

86
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,499
He did drink a lot of
New Cokes last night.

87
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,379
Look, what the hell year is this anyway?

88
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,530
I'm really getting confused.

89
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,879
If Milhouse is in another dimension,

90
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,940
he can communicate with us
by blinking these lights.

91
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,289
Come on, Milhouse. You can do it.

92
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,699
Admit it. Our son is gone.

93
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,376
So, I can tell you.

94
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,879
I've been having an affair.

95
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,439
Is it Milhouse's break dancing tutor?

96
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,079
Did you tell him yet?

97
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,030
Uh... Hold your horses.

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,859
Not now, Milhouse!

99
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,800
Mommy and Daddy are loud talking!

100
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,561
Why don't you go to your room, sweetie?

101
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,400
Whoa, whoa. Easy on the
electric bill there, son.

102
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,739
Hello? Hello?

103
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,160
Uh, i-is Lisa there?

104
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,319
Milhouse?

105
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,219
Uh, that depends.

106
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,246
Do you like Milhouse?

107
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:16,119
I like Milhouse, but I
don't like like Milhouse.

108
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,749
Wrong number!

109
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:22,673
_

110
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:27,009
Milhouse is alive. I just talked to him!

111
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,539
I think he's in another dimension.

112
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,350
This is my best game ever.
I'm not leaving till it's done.

113
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:34,185
Come on, Bart!

114
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:35,929
Fine.

115
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,129
You can reach the parallel dimension

116
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,729
via this sensory deprivation tank.

117
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:41,959
It requires somebody

118
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,279
with an extraordinary
power of mind. Glavin.

119
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,359
Why did you shave your head?

120
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,359
Was it to increase conductivity?

121
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,679
No, I was trying to give myself bangs

122
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,099
and it got away from me.

123
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,290
Now let's do this thing.

124
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,919
I made it. I'm in the Over Under.

125
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,660
Yo.

126
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,249
Milhouse!

127
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,840
You could've escaped anytime!

128
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,563
It felt nice to be embraced.

129
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,019
Okay, here's the secret.

130
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,159
Just hold still and they can't see you.

131
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,260
See?

132
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,119
We are perfectly, perfectly...

133
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,939
Oh.

134
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,620
I forgot we're not
supposed to talk either.

135
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,329
Tough luck, dude.

136
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,799
Oh, my God!

137
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,650
It's a twisted version of reality.

138
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,599
It seems like someone hasn't
seen very much of season three.

139
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,442
How ya doin'? Say hi to your mom.

140
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,979
I'd better use my psychic powers.

141
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,560
I didn't know you had psychic powers.

142
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:16,609
Girls are afraid to use them,

143
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,439
because then we're called unfeminine.

144
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,370
We needlessly lost a lot
of good witches at Salem.

145
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,049
Now I have the power to skip gym!

146
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,634
Boo-yeah!

147
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,239
- Dad?
- Quiet, sweetie.

148
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,260
Daddy's at work.

149
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:42,239
Mr. Burns opened a portal
to another dimension

150
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,520
that released a lot of monsters.

151
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,519
What was he looking for?

152
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,919
It's all part of a secret
government program

153
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,839
to find monsters.

154
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,479
A monster ate Carl, but
because Carl's inside him,

155
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,689
the monster's my friend.

156
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,699
He remembers when we were kids

157
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,939
and we used to go down to...

158
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:05,859
Well, they won't bother us anymore.

159
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,239
You kids are safe.

160
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,679
But we are trapped in
this dimension forever.

161
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,059
Who wants a piggyback ride?

162
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,590
Trapped forever?

163
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,379
It's not so bad here.

164
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,419
Boy, these vines sure are good
at finding all the holes.

165
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,299
In the Over Under,
housing is affordable,

166
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,669
schools are excellent,

167
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:25,159
and you can walk to
shops and restaurants.

168
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,819
Does Amazon deliver here?

169
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,986
They have a fleet of flying monsters.

170
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,959
Well, there is one thing that's better.

171
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,359
At least there's no stupid...

172
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,989
Howdily-doodily, neighborino!

173
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,620
_

174
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,479
Well, sir, it's fourth
down and goal to go.

175
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,879
Quarterback Case Diggs takes the ball.

176
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,319
Hickory dickory dock,
three ticks left on the clock.

177
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,599
He looks. He throws.

178
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,299
Intercepted!

179
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,679
The quarterback choked.

180
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,479
Choke, choke, choke!

181
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,539
Choke, choke, choke!

182
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,879
Hot dog!

183
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,849
- Uh...
- Choke!

184
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,439
Choke, choke, choke,

185
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,879
choke, choke... !

186
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,679
Choke, choke, choke!

187
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,780
Uh-oh.

188
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:25,499
_

189
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,320
Homer Simpson, welcome to Heaven.

190
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,279
Are you Saint Peter?

191
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,699
No, I'm Saint Greeter,
if you'll forgive the pun.

192
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,119
I don't forgive it.

193
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,473
Damn you... !

194
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,060
Hmm. Heaven doesn't
look like I expected.

195
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,272
Yeah. God sold out to Google.

196
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,859
I really wonder if I
did the right thing.

197
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,599
_

198
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,030
Maybe global warming is real.

199
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,479
- _
- Oh, my. This is not good.

200
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,019
Not good! Okay, according to this,

201
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,479
you're not supposed to be here yet.

202
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,621
We have to send you back.

203
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:05,359
I get to see Marge again?

204
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,319
And eat that tub of lasagna
I have in the refrigerator?

205
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,239
It better still be there.

206
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,479
Send me back now!

207
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,859
Look, I would love to, okay?

208
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,899
But the paramedics
couldn't lift your corpse,

209
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,369
so they rolled it into a lake.

210
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,380
Pretty bloated.

211
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,259
Ah. Wait. That's the before picture.

212
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,629
Here's the after picture.

213
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:24,058
And here's the way after picture.

214
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:25,889
It's, uh, pretty disgusting.

215
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,049
You've got to get me back to Marge.

216
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,419
Yeah, okay, got it, got it.

217
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,019
We'll disrupt the paradigm.

218
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,089
Homer, we're gonna put you
in the body of someone

219
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:36,152
who's supposed to die today,
and you can live as them.

220
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,079
Ooh. Can I live in the body of a pig?

221
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,241
I like the freedom of not wearing pants.

222
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:42,929
Oh, there's a six-month
waiting list to be a pig.

223
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:43,940
I'm so sorry.

224
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,279
E-be-de-be-de-be-de. That's all?

225
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,416
Look, just choose one of these, okay?

226
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,119
Hmm. No.

227
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,499
No.

228
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,819
Tempting, but no.

229
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,959
No.

230
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,669
Forget it. Mm.

231
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:59,240
That's the one!

232
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,849
Hey, man, I've been
waiting here a long time.

233
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,000
- _
- Hmm?

234
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,169
Hello?

235
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,773
Hello, Marge.

236
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:14,525
How do you know my name?

237
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:17,759
Now, don't freak out, but
it's me, your husband Homer.

238
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,780
I died, and I'm inside the
body of this football player.

239
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,534
How could I possibly believe that?

240
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:27,479
Because I know something about
you that no one else knows.

241
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,450
- What's that?
- I forget.

242
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,793
It's you!

243
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,756
Fat, fit.

244
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,341
Portly, sportly.

245
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,489
Jell-O? Hello!

246
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:45,990
Mm, whatever body you're
in, I love the guy inside.

247
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,379
Oh, my God, I touched an ab.

248
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,709
I didn't think abs were real.

249
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,499
It's really weird snuggling
with the body of a man

250
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,299
who's married to someone else.

251
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,919
Not just someone, Miss Nude Texas.

252
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,499
All right, Marge. I'll
find someone else's body.

253
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,038
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Mmm.

254
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,623
Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.

255
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:15,799
Oh, yeah.

256
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:24,009
Homie? Homie?

257
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,439
Oh!

258
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,469
You ruined that body in one night?

259
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:31,500
The funeral leftovers were so good.

260
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,481
This is too creepy.
I want something else.

261
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,566
Hmm.

262
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:40,319
It's a real tragedy more
young people don't die.

263
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,929
Dad! You could be
Superintendent Chalmers,

264
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,859
my principal's boss.

265
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,139
Marge, what do you say?

266
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,299
I would like to see
Chalmers with somebody.

267
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,740
He's so lonely.

268
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,248
Boom. He's dead.

269
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,359
You-you wanted to see me, sir?

270
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,940
Skinner!

271
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,719
Because of new school rules,

272
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,779
from now on, Bart gets all A's.

273
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,589
Give yourself a purple nurple.

274
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:10,199
Purpler. Purpler.

275
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,799
This is pure indigo.

276
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,399
He said, "Purpler."

277
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,230
Yes, sir.

278
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,939
A toast to my new life

279
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,939
as public school administrator.

280
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:24,279
And now to open my paycheck
and see what I make.

281
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,533
Next.

282
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:35,979
This has gotten out of hand.

283
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,699
You're changing bodies so much,

284
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,569
I don't even know who
I'm married to anymore.

285
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,965
Oh, so that's why

286
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:45,300
I'm rooting for the apes
in Planet of the Apes.

287
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,739
Oh, please, just pick one man

288
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,879
I can be with for the rest of my life.

289
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,990
He doesn't have to be perfect.

290
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,939
He just has to love me like you do.

291
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,813
Hmm. I know just the guy.

292
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:01,233
Well, I had my doubts, but this works.

293
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:05,487
This is great. My brain in Moe's body.

294
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:06,949
Yeah, and I'm in here.

295
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:10,819
And, uh, Midge, I'm,
uh... I'm very thirsty.

296
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,730
Ew.

297
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,172
_

298
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:28,379
So, I'm the first
person to ever be fired

299
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,999
by the DMV for a bad attitude.

300
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,789
Isn't that something?

301
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,589
Huh? Isn't it?

302
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:37,799
_

303
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,760
I need to sneak a smoke.

304
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,539
I am Kang the Conqueror.

305
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,920
I am Selma the available.

306
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,339
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

307
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,159
This is so romantic.

308
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,699
Let me get a look at you.

309
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,717
Aah!

310
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,802
Oh, you don't like what you see.

311
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,019
Quite the contrary.

312
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,469
"Aah" is our word for "beautiful."

313
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:18,389
Oh.

314
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,529
Freak.

315
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,239
Can you turn yourself?

316
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,339
We're gonna make out.

317
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,956
Just kill me now.

318
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,620
What's wrong, my darling?

319
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:47,659
My sister says you just want to
eat me, or for a green card.

320
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,880
Or a human zoo.

321
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:51,619
Two of those are ridiculous.

322
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,240
Quick! Hide!

323
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:56,059
Hello. Just want you to know

324
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,869
we'll be dissecting you tomorrow.

325
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:01,239
But I could teach you the secret
of clean, natural energy.

326
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,380
Then I'll dissect you tonight.

327
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,900
We have to save you!

328
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:09,259
What do you want?

329
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:13,219
How'd you like me to go to a
distant galaxy and never return?

330
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,320
You rang?

331
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,587
We've come to get you out, my love.

332
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:28,779
Oh, we're using the "L" word, huh?

333
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,342
Should've been a conversation, but okay.

334
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,789
This thing is full of rats.

335
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,339
Very thoughtful.

336
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,269
Hold it right there, Simpson.
What are you up to?

337
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,089
Um, I am, uh, you know,

338
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,519
uh, cover story, stalling for time,

339
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,919
cover story, hemming,
hawing, excuse, alibi.

340
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,610
Promotion?

341
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,039
Don't shoot at the van.
Shoot at the driver.

342
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,749
Not my driver.

343
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,439
My partner Kodos will meet us

344
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,339
at the top of Mount Springfield.

345
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,299
- Partner?
- Writing partner.

346
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,379
They told us, if you want
to make it in showbiz,

347
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,513
you have to be on Earth.

348
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,934
Sorry I'm late.

349
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,019
By mistake, I went to that other Earth

350
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,859
where the South won the Civil War.

351
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,940
Far fewer Confederate monuments.

352
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,361
Kang.

353
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:34,430
I've been hit.

354
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,951
One moment, my love.

355
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,819
Nah! Nah! Missed me!

356
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,819
Fear not, my sultry smokestack.

357
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,109
I can heal you.

358
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,460
Maybe you should cut
down a little, dear.

359
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,839
For the baby.

360
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,049
- You mean... ?
- That's right.

361
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:07,139
I'm pregnant. Mmm.

362
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,219
Selma, no!

363
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,940
You two are too different.

364
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,403
You're a Leo, and he's a Sagittarius.

365
00:19:13,404 --> 00:19:15,219
I'm from Sagittarius.

366
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,649
Oh, don't go, Selma.

367
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:22,660
Please. I can't live without you.

368
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,139
Oh...

369
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,319
I have to warn you... I'm gay.

370
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,479
That's all right.

371
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,088
I have 32 sexual identities.

372
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,949
I'm Klingon curious,

373
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,099
always up for some Wookiee nookie

374
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,919
or an R2 threesome,

375
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,559
not to mention some Deep Space Nine,

376
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,500
or possibly Jabba the Butt.

00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,679
Are you enjoying the honeymoon planet?

379
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,831
Why didn't we come here
in the cool season?

380
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:08,659
This is the cool season.

381
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,179
Shall I get a sweater for you, dear?

382
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,999
It's 4,000 degrees.

383
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,089
Nag, nag, nag.

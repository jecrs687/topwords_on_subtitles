00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680
[la Trémoille] So...

3
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,720
is that it?

4
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,360
Your lover is the coachman.

5
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,920
- Is that it?
- [Jean] Hey!

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
[shushing]

7
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,160
Odette, you've sunk really low.

8
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,080
As a peasants' daughter,
it's back to your roots.

9
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,680
No, it's a misunderstanding.

10
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,840
Misunderstanding?

11
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,600
You fuck my wife,

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,640
and it's a misunderstanding?

13
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,720
No!

Stop!

18
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,080
He's dead.

19
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,680
- Let's go.
- What have I done?

20
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,520
- Come on.
- What have I done?

21
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,160
Come!

22
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,360
[panting] Wait.

23
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,760
No. Jean!

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,240
Jean, no...

25
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,280
- Come, darling.
- No.

26
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,400
Jean! Jean! Jean!

27
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,440
- What is it, darling?
- No!

28
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,520
We can't leave now.

29
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,560
What?

30
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,320
She'll name me.
She'll connect la Trémoille's death to me.

31
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,840
So what? They won't find us. Come!

32
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,960
- No!
- Come!

33
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,640
I don't want us to be fugitives.

34
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,920
My baby shouldn't be born in jail.

35
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,320
- If we're caught, I'll blame me.
- No!

36
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
Jean, no!

37
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,480
Listen to me.

38
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,960
I'll make his death seem like
a riding accident.

39
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,280
He's known to drink.

40
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,640
He could have had an accident.

41
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,440
Trust me.

42
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,160
Trust me, my love.

43
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,000
We'll be together again.

44
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,600
- Rose...
- I love you.

45
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,320
Go away. Go away!

49
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,160
I have a surprise.

50
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,600
Mama!

51
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,160
Oh, my darling, my love.
I'm so happy to see you.

52
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,440
Look at me.

53
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,360
Now...

54
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,360
I'll let you catch up.

55
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,040
[door closes]

56
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,120
Are you all right?

57
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,320
I hate being with Papa.

58
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,800
I know. Me too.

59
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,680
Listen to me.

60
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,440
You will leave today, okay?

61
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,960
A policeman friend will come arrest
your father

62
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,200
when he's received the letter I sent him.

63
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,280
You shouldn't be here.

64
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,760
If it's dangerous, why do you stay?

65
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,160
I'm not at risk.

66
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,360
- I don't want to leave alone.
- Listen.

67
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,240
It's important that you trust me.

68
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,480
I promise that I'll join you
in a few days, and we'll be together.

69
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,800
We'll never hear from him again.

70
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,880
I promise you.

71
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,360
All right?

72
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,040
It will be okay, I'm telling you.

73
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,360
You have to be brave, okay?

74
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,920
Huh?

75
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,760
You have to be brave.

76

[lock clicks]

77
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,040
You'll write this denial.

78
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,520
Say you were misinformed
and taken advantage of.

79
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,560
Alice...

80
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,080
You don't know what you risk.

81
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,360
What we all risk.

82
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,640
It's about your life.

83
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,280
Your life, you hear?

84
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,640
You've always told me
that fear impedes progress.

85
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,800
And progress is our freedom.

86
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,040
Women's freedom.

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,320
I had to speak up.

88
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Like it or not.

89
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,800
You'll end up in a convent.

00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,440

91
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,240

98
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,040
Your daughter's article, really...

99
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,840
What got into her?

100
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,040
[man 2] You can't control the women
in your family? For shame.

101
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,039
Mr. de Lenverpré wants to see you.

102
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,680
Jeansin, I haven't seen
the denial I asked for.

103
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,920
Why is that?

104
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,600
Alice refuses to.

105
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,560
So, it's you

106
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,360
who will write this denial.

107
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,520
I can't wait any longer.

108
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,680
Minville's expedited trial is
this afternoon.

109
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,800
Your denial will end any doubts.

110

[door opens]

111
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,640
Gentlemen.

112
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,640
You're leading in the Senate elections.

113
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,520
Thank you, but it's not won yet.

114
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,840
It's all good.

[Marc-Antoine] <i>Miss de Jeansin's testimony
disturbed public opinion.</i>

116
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,480
By claiming the cinema's projector caused
the Bazaar fire,

117
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,440
this young woman accuses us
of falsifying truth

118
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,480
and condemning an innocent.

119
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,720
Poor child.

120
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,560
The fire caused her to go mad.

121
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,120
She even accused her father.

122
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,040
Dear Mr. de Jeansin,
I empathize with your pain, believe me.

123
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,160
And I thank you for doing what was needed
to restore the truth.

124
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,600
Is it true, about Alice?

125
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,840
No.

126
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,480
He's lying.

127
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,040
She told the truth in <i>The Owl.</i>

128
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,320
The cinema started the Bazaar fire.

129
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,080
You'd let an innocent man be executed?

130
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,520
He'll have her committed
unless I tell his truth.

131
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,880
It will get him elected.

132
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,920
Times are confusing,
and Lenverpré is using the situation.

133
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,640
A summary judgment and an execution?

134
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,480
He will easily get it.

135
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,720
He owns all the officials. They owe him.

136
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,960
Myself included.

137
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,600
You knew this when I fingered Minville?

138
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,840
Yes.

139
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,160
Where is Alice?

140
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,840
- Where is she?
- [butler] In her bedroom.

141
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,600
Why are you here?

142
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,240
I know everything.

143
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,200
I want to see Alice.

144
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,040
I need to talk to her.

145
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,160
I'm not sure she wants you to.

146
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,840
I didn't know it was an accident.

147
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,880
I didn't.

148
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,000
They said it was an attack! Everybody!

149
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,280
And I was convinced he was guilty!

150
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,800
I was certain!

151
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,680
That he had set a bomb
and destroyed everything!

152
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,880
Do you hear me?

153
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,480
I can't do anything for him anymore.

154
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,480
I can never repair what I have done.

155
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,800
But I can help you.

156
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,000
Do you hear me? I can help you.

157
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,720
I'll arrange for you to meet.

00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,480
Mama, I don't want to go.

162
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,600
Not without you.

163
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,560
- We do as planned.
- Please, Mama!

164
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,000
We do as planned. Play.

165
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,760
Focus. You're not there.

166
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,840
It's too difficult!

167
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,280
No. Not if you do the work.

I'm sick of Papa and you!

I hate you both!

It will do her good.

Where's Camille?

175
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,600
She went to sulk in the garden.
She was struggling with the sonata.

176
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,160
Go get my daughter.

177
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,720
I thought after the election
we might go to Deauville, the three of us.

178
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,760
What do you say?

179
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,440
Very good idea.

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,520
Where's Camille?

186
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,200
I don't know.

187
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,600
You think I'm dumb? Where is she?

188
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,040
I do not know.

189
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,800
I'd have let her go, alone in Paris?
No, I don't know.

190
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,400
You got her to escape.

191
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,120
Well done.

192
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,880
You're really a slut.

193
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,720
Who helped you? How did you do it?

194
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,800
[gasps]

195
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,480
You betrayed me.

196
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,360
What will you do?

197
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,440
Huh?

198
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,640
Kill me?

199
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,320
Like Eva Schaff.

200
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,520
Like Hugues.

201
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,360
I might be a slut, but you're scum.

202
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,480
Eva? How did you find out?

203
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,320
She, too, was a slut. Like you.

204
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,600
You're all sluts, without scruples.

205
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,080
She was gorgeous, too.

206
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,920
That didn't save her.

207
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,240
It's actually good that Camille's gone.

208
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,560
We'll be able to be together, you and I.

209
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,160
We can have fun.

210
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,080
[Jacques] He was found like this,
with his horse by him.

211
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,840
We surmised he tried to mount
and the horse reared up.

212
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,760
[man] I think it's odd.

213
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,600
This horse is very gentle.

214
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,680
Very patient.

215
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,760
[Jacques] Should I call the police?

216
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,840
Yes. They should witness the accident.

217
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,600
And advise the mortician.

218
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,920
- Does my daughter know?
- Not yet.

219
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,640
I'll deal with it.

220
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,480
Please leave.

221
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,640
[Thomas] Why are you crying? Are you hurt?

222
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,720
[Rose] No.

223
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,920
Did someone hurt you?

224
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,200
No, it's me.

225
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,840
I did something terrible.

226
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,160
It happens to me, too.

227
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,560
I have awful news to share

228
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,120
with you both.

229
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,480
Thomas.

230
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,960
Your father had a riding accident.

231
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,040
Is it serious?

232
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,360
Yes. Very serious.

233
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,160
Does it mean he's dead?

234
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,400
Yes.

235
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,680
That's what it means. I'm sorry.

236
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,560
Tonight, can I sleep with you?

237
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,080
Sure.

238
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,560
Of course.

239
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,480
Of course.

240
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,800
You'll be able to go.

241
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,440
I regret it happened this way.

242
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,240
So do I.

243
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,280
- Julien...
- Go now.

244
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,320
Thank you.

245
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,680
[driver] Go.

246
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,640
[gate closes]

247
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,960
Come along.

248
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,720
[excited chatter]

249
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,760
[man 1] Look at that!

250
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,040
- [man 2] The bourgeois girl!
- [man 3] Come on!

251
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,520
My love...

252
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,360
[door closes]

253
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,240
I spoke to the press.

254
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,400
I told them the truth.

255
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,920
Things are looking up.

256
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,720
No.

257
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,640
They're not looking up.

258
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,280
I've been convicted.
I was tried in a closed session.

259
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,720
I'll be executed in the morning.

260
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,480
No.

261
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,960
They can't do this.

262
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,720
It's over.

263
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,920
- Don't cry. No, don't cry.
- No!

264
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,000
No! No!

265
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,080
No!

266
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,800
No!

267
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,200
Stop crying.

268
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,440
They can't do this.

269
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,280
Hey. Hey.

270
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,160
Look at me.

271
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,880
No regrets.

272
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,400
No regrets.

273
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,560
Without the fire,
I would never have met you.

274
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,600
Huh?

275
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,520
That makes it worth dying over.

276
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,640
Don't cry.

277
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,400
You're so beautiful.

278
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,800
You're so beautiful.

279
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,560
Where is she?

280
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,880
With the man she loves.

281
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,120
So, she can say goodbye.

282
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,960
Why did you let her?

283
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,920
He's innocent, Auguste.

284
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,800
You can't allow this. It isn't fair.

285
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,240
Alice is right. It's not like you.

286
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,600
We're trapped.

287
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,680
I can't do a thing.

288
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,200
Yes, you can.

289
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,960
Listen to me.

290
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,880
Lenverpré is a murderer.
He once killed his mistress.

291
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,880
Do you hear? He's a murderer.

292
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,840
Adrienne told me.

293
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,680
Two days ago.

294
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,920
She is alive.

295
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,280
You asked for me?

296
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,920
I wanted to have breakfast
with my daughter.

297
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,920
Thank you, Jacques. You can leave us.

298
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,840
And close the door after you.

299
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,160
I found this...

300
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,280
in the stables...

301
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,280
near la Trémoille's body.

302
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,720
What were you doing there?

303
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,520
What happened?

304
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,560
Who was with you?

305
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,240
Jean.

306
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,720
We wanted to escape together.

307
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,040
I wanted to leave your house.

308
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,400
La Trémoille caught us.

309
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,600
He wanted to kill my husband.
I defended him.

310
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,760
It was I who killed him.

311
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,240
Jean wasn't involved.

312
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,920
I'm very...

313
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
upset...

314
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,720
to learn that you want to leave,
abandoning your child.

315
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,840
I'm not his mother.

316
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,040
He likes you. He loves you.

317
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,200
You love him, too. You must stay.

318
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,280
No.

319
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,160
I can't do this.

320
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,200
Not to Jean.

321
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,680
- With our baby...
- Wait.

322
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,880
I will never turn you in.

323
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,480
In a few months, I'll leave this world.

324
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,840
I'm gravely ill.

325
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,880
And Thomas won't have anyone
to care for him.

326
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,400
Unless you decide to stay...

327
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,600
and you swear to me

328
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,520
that you will bring up this child
as your own.

329
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,920
Rose...

330
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,240
I trust you.

331
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,720
I only need your word.

332
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,800
At my death, you will inherit everything.

333
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,920
Absolutely everything.

334
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,560
As of today, Odette...

335
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
is a widow.

336
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,920
She's free.

337
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,160
And soon she can marry again...

338
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,120
with whomever she pleases...

339
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,280
without anyone having a say about it.

340
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:29,720
[Léo] Hot off the presses!
Victor Minville's execution!

341
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,480
Opposition slams
Conservative dirty tricks!

346
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,960
[woman] Kill him!

347
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,000
Move out of the way!

348
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,040
Go on, move it!

349
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,480
Move back!

350
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,040
Come on, move back!

351
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,080
Stop! He's innocent!

352
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,600
Please! He has done nothing!

353
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,320
He has done nothing!

354
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,880
[guard] Remove her!

355
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,960
He has done nothing!

356
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,240
Cut his head off!

357
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,520
Stop it!

358
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,040
Let him go!

359
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,120
I love you, Alice! I love you!

360
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,240
Go, move!

361
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,680
He hasn't done anything!

362
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,520
He hasn't done anything!

363
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,000
Kill him!

364
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,640
Let us through.

365
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,880
[crowd chanting] <i>Kill him!
Kill him! Kill him!</i>

366
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,720
[crowd silences]

367
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,160
[man] Bastard!

368
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,320
[man 1] Kill him!

369
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,440
[man 2] Get it over with!

370
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,560
[man 3] Bastard!

371
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,960
- [man 4] You anarchist bastard!
- [crowd clamoring]

372
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,400
Murderer!

373
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,280
Murderer!

374
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,120
Bastard!

375
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,320
Murderer!

376
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,199
Murderer!

377
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,679
- He has done nothing!
- Stop!

378
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,719
He's innocent! This man is innocent!

379
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,159
Stop! Stop!

380
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,920
Stop! Listen to me!

381
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,320
Silence!

382
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,400
Silence!

383
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,199
- Listen to me!
- [crowd silences]

384
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,760
This man is innocent.

385
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,719
[woman] Tripe!

386
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,199
[man] Who is this guy?

387
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,600
The cinematograph caused
the Charity Bazaar fire.

388
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,480
It was an accident.

389
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,080
He wasn't involved.

390
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,120
I'm Auguste de Jeansin.

391
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,280
I had the cinematograph installed.

392
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,240
I am responsible for the fire.

393
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,080
For all the victims.

394
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,520
[man 1] How do we know
you're telling the truth?

395
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,240
- [man 2] Yes.
- [man 3] That's right.

396
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,720
[man 4] Cut his head off!

397
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,440
Why give myself up

398
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,360
if it wasn't the truth?

399
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,720
[man 1] Why didn't anybody say it before?

400
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,960
- [man 2] Why?
- [man 3] Cut his head off!

401
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,040
[crowd clamoring]

402
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,480
[woman] No, the government!

403
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,600
[Martin] Silence!

404
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,640
Silence!

405
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,520
- [man] Talk about justice, you bastards!
- The execution is on hold,

406
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,960
pending further investigation.

407
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,040
- [crowd cheering]
- [man] Bravo!

408
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,120
[men jeering]

409
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,320
Jeansin, follow me.

410
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,160
[guard] Leave! You can't stay here!

411
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,360
Go!

412
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,840
Papa!

413
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,920
Auguste!

414
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,480
- Auguste!
- Papa!

415
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:38,160
What got into you? You've lost your mind?
Like your daughter?

416
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
No.

417
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,520
No.

418
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,920
She's right.

419
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,000
- This man is innocent.
- Really?

420
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,080
And the accident theory,
you have proof of it?

421
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,520
Lenverpré killed the only witness,

422
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
the projectionist.

423
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,160
He'd do anything.

424
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,760
Even detain his wife.

425
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,320
What are saying?

426
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,080
- His wife died in the fire.
- No, she didn't.

427
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,200
Adrienne is alive.

428
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,920
She's contacted my wife
several times since the fire.

429
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,240
I can confirm it. I saw her.

430
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,760
Why didn't you say anything?

431
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,920
Hennion asked me not to.

432
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,920
Go get him.

433
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,480
[Auguste] He is a monster.

434
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,640
A monster.

435
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,760
- [Leblanc] I'm listening, Hennion.
- Remember Eva Schaff,

436
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,240
the murdered cabaret singer?

437
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,320
Yes.

438
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,280
She was a lovely woman.

439
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,560
She was his mistress.

440
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,120
Lenverpré killed her
because she wanted to quit.

441
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,680
Quit what?

442
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,120
He used her to transmit

443
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,640
coded documents through musical scores

444
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,840
to the Prussian Secret Services.

445
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,920
Excuse me.

446
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,480
[Leblanc] What? What's this nonsense?
Are you insane?

447
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,680
[Hennion] It's the truth.
You wouldn't hear it, but he owns us all.

448
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,960
Lenverpré is a manipulator,
a murderer, a traitor.

449
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,000
I know what I'm talking about.

450
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,000
[Leblanc] De Lenverpré, a traitor?

451
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,200
The man who will become Senate President,
supported by the gentry?

452
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,760
Do you realize what you're saying?

453
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,920
This came for you.

454
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,896
- While you were detained.
- [Leblanc] What is it?

455
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,240
[Martin] Musical scores.
I hadn't looked at them.

456
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,800
I thought it was a prank, but now...

457
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:37,320
Here are musical scores my husband uses
to pass military secrets to Prussia.

458
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,280
[Hennion] It's from Adrienne de Lenverpré.

459
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,480
She went back to get them.

460
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,560
She's gutsy.

461
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,760
You wanted proof? Here it is.

462
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,840
[Marc-Antoine] Scram.

463
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,880
[door opens]

464
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,600
[door closes]

465
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,320
Mr. Hennion, Leblanc.

466
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,080
What brings you here?

467
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,480
A problem with the execution?

468
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,800
Where's Mrs. de Lenverpré?

469
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,160
At the cemetery.

470
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,560
You don't read the paper?

471
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,200
Back then, I couldn't prove it.

472
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,000
Eva Schaff's murder,
the horrors you've committed...

473
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,280
Today we have enough to execute you.

474
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,440
You are under arrest

475
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,880
for betraying the homeland.

476
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,440
Nothing proves they're mine.

477
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,120
Except if we find more.

478
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,960
In your safe, for example.

479
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,400
A handwriting test will do the rest.

480
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,120
For the last time, sir.

481
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,640
Where's your wife?

482
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,520
She's in a bedroom.

483
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,720
On the second floor.

484
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,640
I punished her for what she did.

485
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,680
Catherine,

486
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,120
show Mr. Hennion the way.

487
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,360
Yes, sir.

488
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,920
[door closes]

489
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,320
I don't want prison or a trial.

490
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,000
Allow me, Mr. Leblanc...

491
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,880
to die with dignity.

492
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,920
[door closes]

493
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,320
Give me this key.

494
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,920
[muttering]

495
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,200
Damn! Sir!

496
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,880
Where is he?

497
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,280
Where is he?!

498
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,200
[dog barking]

499
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,320
- What's got into you?
- That's why you came back.

500
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,880
- What?
- I thought it was Camille.

501
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,000
What's this about?

502
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,560
- The musical scores you sent to the cops?
- What scores?

503
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,320
- Well, the cops are here!
- What?

504
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,280
- They're here.
- What are you saying?

505
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,960
For you, they're here too late.

506
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,960
What are you talking about?

507
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,040
No!

508
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,760
[Adrienne yelps]

509
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,560
Stop it!

510
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,960
Stop! Stop!

511
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,000
You're crazy.

512
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,120
Stop it, Marc-Antoine!

513
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,680
[yelping]

514
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,680
- Shut your mouth!
- Stop it!

515
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,440
[crying]

516
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,000
You should have burned alive
at the Charity Bazaar.

517
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,000
Well, it's only justice.

518
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,920
What? What?

519
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,680
What? No! No!

520
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,440
No! No!

521
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,800
No!

522
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,320
My God, no!

523
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,240
Help!

524
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,000
No!

525
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,360
Help!

526
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,960
Help me!

527
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,000
It must be horribly painful.

528
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,280
And it lasts a long time.

529
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,480
But don't worry...

530
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,800
- No, don't do it!
- I'll be with you till the end.

531
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,480
You will burn in hell!

532
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,920
[humming]

533
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,960
No. Stop.

534
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,200
Don't do this.

535
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,560
[Adrienne crying]

536
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,640
You'll see...

537
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,280
you'll miss me.

538
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,720
Farewell, Adrienne.

539
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,520
I love you.

540
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,520
[gunshot]

541
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
[thudding]

542
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,800
Help me!

543
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,840
[crying] Help!

544
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,600
Help me!

545
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,680
- Help!
- It's all right. It's all right.

546
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,400
Is it gas?

547
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,040
- He killed himself in the bathroom.
- Deal with her. I'll go up.

548
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,760
Get some water.

549
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,720
Quickly.

550
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:41,201
[Hennion] <i>We've canvassed the city,
but we haven't found anything yet.</i>

551
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,600
We think he fled to Germany.

552
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,000
He'll never be found.

553
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,080
We'll go on protecting you for a while.

554
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,760
I won't live in a cage.

555
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,280
I have plans with my daughter.

556
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
As you wish.

557
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,720
[all singing a nursery rhyme]

558
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,160
Bravo!

559
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:23,440
Victor!

560
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,640
Victor!

561
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,360
- Hello.
- [both] Miss.

562
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:03,960
[Alice] Hello.

563
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,000
Hello, Miss de Jeansin.

564
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,160
Hello, Alice.

565
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Hello.

566
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,560
I'll leave you.

567
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,240
I'm happy you came.

568
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,360
I was glad you asked me to come.

569
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,200
Why is Jean here?

570
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:04,960
He lives here now.

571
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,960
Madame Huchon hired him as a coachman.

572
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,280
He looks happy.

573
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,280
That's good.

574
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:21,720
He was so sad.

575
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,400
It's not America, but we're happy.

576
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,280
I feel guilty I ever doubted him.

577
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,840
I was afraid.

578
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:11,920
Afraid of his gaze.

579
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,320
Afraid he'd reject me.

580
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:16,560
Not love me anymore...

581
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,480
or not recognize me.

582
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,040
Rose...

583
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,280
But he's still here.

584
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,080
So, I'm trying my luck...

585
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,440
with someone...

586
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,840
Someone I love deeply.

587
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,560
I hope...

588
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,320
that I'm forgiven...

589
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,520
and what I did...

590
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,360
is accepted.

591
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,360
I am so sorry.

592
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:56,800
I'm sorry.

593
00:52:58,680 --> 00:52:59,680
Alice.

594
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,520
I missed you.

595
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:05,840
I'm here.

596
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,080
We have survived.

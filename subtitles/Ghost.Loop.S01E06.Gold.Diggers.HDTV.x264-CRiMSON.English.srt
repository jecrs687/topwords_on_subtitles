1
00:00:01,535 --> 00:00:03,202
There was a murder in the house
at one time.

2
00:00:03,204 --> 00:00:05,237
There was a murder
in the house?

3
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:06,972
Like shots of a headache.

4
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:08,841
Speak to us.

5
00:00:08,843 --> 00:00:10,909
They murdered the man
for his gold.

6
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:12,444
- "my gold."
- "my gold"?

7
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:14,446
- "my gold."
- "my gold."

8
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:16,348
Do you know what's
happening in the house?

9
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,751
That's a stairwell
going straight up, boys.

10
00:00:18,753 --> 00:00:22,121
The most frightening thing
is being shoved.

11
00:00:25,226 --> 00:00:26,458
Dude, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:29,161
- "hold my hand."
- my god.

13
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:36,802
They are
the spirit hunters.

14
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:39,038
I feel something
behind me.

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,373
They are who people call
when they are tormented

16
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,877
by entities that circle back
night after night --

17
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,581
entities bent on destroying
the lives of the living.

18
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,817
Does this look like the night
that you were murdered?

19
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:54,153
These spirits
are often trapped,

20
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:58,590
repeating the same trauma
over and over.

21
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:00,325
The mission
of the spirit hunters

22
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:03,996
is to help the living
by breaking the cycle of

23
00:01:03,998 --> 00:01:05,464
the ghost loop.

24
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:11,537
The spirit hunters
are in clear spring, maryland,

25
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:14,907
where lee and garry are
being attacked by a ghost loop.

26
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:20,679
There's at least two spirits
in this house.

27
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:24,083
They're residents.
They are here.

28
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:27,719
It's just kind of a feeling of
being pushed down the stairs.

29
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:28,954
That's scary.

30
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:31,190
I don't know how
to tell them to go.

31
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:32,758
I don't think
we're gonna be able

32
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,929
to sell the house
until it's clean.

33
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:40,732
This, of course,
was one of the prominent states

34
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:42,101
during the civil war,

35
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:45,170
so you can definitely feels that
energy just driving around here.

36
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:48,006
We're talking civil war,
and slavery,

37
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:50,476
and those were two
very emotional,

38
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:52,878
traumatic times
in history.

39
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,582
Clear spring is 6 miles from
the border of pennsylvania,

40
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:59,251
a free state since 1787,

41
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:01,587
which made clear spring
one of the last stops

42
00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:03,255
on the underground railroad.

43
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:06,592
As you guys were bringing up
all this stuff,

44
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:10,762
I just have an overall sense
of desperation.

45
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:15,868
Built in 1803, lee and garry's
home is steeped in history.

46
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,672
The possibilities for what the
ghost loop might be are vast.

47
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:22,241
So, lee, can you tell us
a little bit

48
00:02:22,243 --> 00:02:23,909
about the ghost loop
of activity?

49
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:25,244
What exactly
happens to you?

50
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:29,448
Every night, between
about 1:00 and 3:00,

51
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:34,620
I wake up hearing voices
and footsteps downstairs.

52
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:39,458
When I get up, I go out to the
landing, lean over the railing,

53
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,160
there was a mist.

54
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:42,628
The mist,
for a few moments,

55
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,230
had the shape of
a lady in a gown.

56
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:46,465
But without a doubt,

57
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:49,668
the most frightening thing
is being shoved.

58
00:02:53,908 --> 00:02:55,874
Really terrifying.
That is scary.

59
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:58,110
You feel this shove
when you're on the stairs?

60
00:02:58,112 --> 00:03:01,146
Yes. Yes.
I could fall down the stairs.

61
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:03,615
That could...
It could be fatal.

62
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:04,683
Right. Yes.

63
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,518
It's really, really scary.

64
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,086
Can you guys
go a little bit

65
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:10,322
deep into the history
of this property?

66
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:15,060
The house was built in 1803
as a tavern for travelers

67
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:16,828
going to
the ohio territory.

68
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,096
It was built by slaves,

69
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:20,465
and then, it was part of
the underground railroad.

70
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:22,501
Pennsylvania
is right nearby.

71
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:24,203
6 miles.
6 miles north of here.

72
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:27,172
I could imagine, during slavery,
that this could have been

73
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:29,708
one of their last stops
to freedom.

74
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,410
It was.

75
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:34,913
The tavern was a destination
for the underground railroad,

76
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:37,282
but not to give slaves
their freedom.

77
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:40,752
The innkeeper
and his wife...

78
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,154
Their name was kinsell.

79
00:03:42,156 --> 00:03:44,656
...They would capture
runaway slaves,

80
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:47,759
and then sell them back
for $5 each.

81
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:50,462
During its days on
the underground railroad,

82
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:52,998
the house had a tunnel
that ran underneath,

83
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,734
where freedom seekers
were kept.

84
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,736
It was also the place
where the kinsells kept

85
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:01,073
one for their own --
a little boy.

86
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:03,075
What happened
with the little boy?

87
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:06,945
They kept the little boy,
and when they had to hide him,

88
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:08,814
they would hide him
in the tunnel under the house.

89
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:09,982
Tunnel?

90
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:11,783
Is it visible?
You can still see it?

91
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,952
No.
It's been closed off.

92
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:16,755
So, there was a good chance
that he was in that damp,

93
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,424
cold tunnel, and got sick,
and died.

94
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,126
We really don't know.

95
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:24,196
So, what are the fatalities that
you know of on this property?

96
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:26,565
The little boy
and a runaway slave

97
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:27,933
that was killed
up in the woods.

98
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,568
He was hanged.
Right here?

99
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,938
Right up here,
in the woods.

100
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,973
What about the innkeepers
themselves?

101
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:37,776
Well, we know that kinsell
was an alcoholic

102
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:40,045
after the
little boy's death.

103
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:45,450
He apparently died falling off
a wagon, and breaking his neck.

104
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:50,656
Lee and garry take kris
and sean into the house

105
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:52,991
to show them the location
of the ghost loop.

106
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:56,662
But on the way, lee shows them
where the tunnel once was.

107
00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:59,531
This is the area
under the stairs.

108
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:02,467
And the tunnel
is under this floor.

109
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,806
Could you walk us through
the exact steps

110
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,542
when you're awoken at night
with the ghost loop of activity?

111
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:12,344
Absolutely.
I'd be glad to.

112
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,616
This is our bedroom.

113
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:19,418
And this is where
I'm sleeping

114
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,088
when I wake up hearing
the voices and the footsteps.

115
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,158
And I'll come out here
to the landing.

116
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,628
And I do try to look over,
but as you can see,

117
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,864
you really can't see
the entire hallway there.

118
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:35,167
Coming down here,
I can still hear the voices

119
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,501
and this footsteps.

120
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,303
And this is where this thing
wants to shove you,

121
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:40,272
right here at this point?
Right here. Right here.

122
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:42,808
This is where I feel
the...The push.

123
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,110
This is the most dangerous part
of the stairs,

124
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:47,713
that you would
harm yourself the worst.

125
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:50,515
It is very scary.

126
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,351
With the interview over,

127
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:54,653
sean and kris fill in
the rest of the team.

128
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:56,655
- What's up guys?
How we doing?
- What's going on?

129
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:59,157
This place used to
be a tavern.

130
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,793
Lots of walks of life
have come through this property.

131
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:03,962
There's a couple
of culprits.

132
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:07,032
The innkeepers that owned the
tavern and the little boy slave

133
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,900
that was here fleeing
for his safety.

134
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,936
And then, lastly,
we have this man

135
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:12,637
that was hung
on the property

136
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,575
'cause he was trying to
escape for his freedom.

137
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:18,877
So, here's the plan --
the three of you,

138
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,245
why don't you guys
go inside the house,

139
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:21,546
see what you guys
can get.

140
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,115
Because this man may have been
hung right up the hill,

141
00:06:23,117 --> 00:06:24,783
kris and I are going to go
up there, and check it out,

142
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:26,184
and see if we can get any
evidence of that, as well.

143
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:27,753
And we'll link up
past that.

144
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:28,787
Sweet.

145
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:29,855
- Alright, guys.
- Let's go.

146
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:36,294
While matt, eric, and califf
investigate the location

147
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:37,929
of the ghost loop
in the house,

148
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:40,432
sean and kris
investigate outside,

149
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:42,968
where a runaway slave
was murdered.

150
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,973
Emf reader -- see if you
get any spikes.

151
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:49,174
What do you want
to use first?

152
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:50,475
I'm gonna use
the portable gateway.

153
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:53,078
It's just another interpretation
of the spirit box,

154
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,413
but it has an echo.

155
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:57,015
It eliminates some of
the white noise,

156
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:59,818
gives the spirits
opportunity to speak.

157
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,386
Okay.

158
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:03,388
Was someone killed
over here?

159
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:09,327
Are we standing close
to where you hung, sir?

160
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,065
Were you running
for your life?

161
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:27,078
Do you have anything to do with
the activity in this house?

162
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,249
Do you know who does?

163
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,225
I can't believe that's
going off right now.

164
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:42,127
That's crazy.

165
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,198
That sounded like
a little kid.

166
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:52,704
Is a little boy
with us right now?

167
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:54,739
We want to know
if he's with us.

168
00:07:57,211 --> 00:07:58,977
Man.

169
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:02,047
"look down there, ma."

170
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:03,215
"look down there, ma."

171
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:04,616
I heard that.

172
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:06,251
Look down where?
The tunnel?

173
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:09,988
"yes."
"yes."

174
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,991
it really does sound like we're
communicating with a little boy.

175
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:17,562
Can you tell us who is
scaring garry and lee?

176
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,300
Are the innkeepers' spirits
lingering here

177
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:23,635
on the property
or in the house?

178
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:24,936
Touch the device.

179
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,241
My god,
look how crazy it went.

180
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:31,610
Do you want our help
while we're here to investigate?

181
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:32,944
Touch the device.

182
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:37,249
So, that's confirmation,
right there.

183
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:39,251
Can you tell us your name,
little boy?

184
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:44,623
I wonder if he's,
like, scared?

185
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,391
You don't have to
hide anymore.

186
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:52,030
It got really quiet.

187
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:55,500
I think the little boy
is just nervous --

188
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,302
too nervous and scared
to come through,

189
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:58,703
and communicate with us.

190
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,171
Yeah.

191
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:02,841
While sean and kris continue
to search for evidence,

192
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:05,677
inside, matt, eric,
and califf investigate

193
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,547
where the ghost loop
lures lee out of her bed,

194
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:10,949
and pushes her
down the stairs.

195
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:13,218
It's right
around here.

196
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,954
She starts feeling
this violent push.

197
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:17,455
Here. 0.3.

198
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:18,757
0.3.
Alright, eric.

199
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,092
Talk to them, baby.
- Where are you?

200
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:25,730
Come to me
with what you got.

201
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:26,865
Push me.

202
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,304
You know, it may be
that it's too early.

203
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:34,072
This thing comes out
in the middle of the night,

204
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,173
and wakes her up.

205
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:36,374
That's a good point.

206
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:38,643
I've got my back turned
towards these steps.

207
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:39,945
Where are you?

208
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:42,981
So you can try to hide all you
want, but we will find you.

209
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:45,817
I feeling like something's
behind me right now.

210
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,152
2.4.

211
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:52,357
You don't want to pick
on a dude, do you?

212
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:54,659
You want to pick on
this scared woman.

213
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:55,927
I'm gonna lay down.

214
00:09:57,998 --> 00:10:00,765
I definitely had this
incredibly worrying feeling

215
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,535
that they were going to be
pushed down the stairs.

216
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:05,437
Where's this entity

217
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,807
that violently pushes lee
on the steps?

218
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,311
"it's on the stairs."

219
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,425
The spirit hunters
are in clear spring, maryland,

220
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:31,529
where lee is being pushed down
her stairs by a ghost loop.

221
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:36,401
I could be hurt.
It could be fatal.

222
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:37,802
At the edge
of the property,

223
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:41,339
sean and kris contact
a little boy who died long ago

224
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:44,175
when the house
was a tavern.

225
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:45,310
That sounded like
a little kid.

226
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,813
Is a little boy with us
right now?

227
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,382
Man.

228
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:52,884
Meanwhile,
eric, califf, and matt

229
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:55,587
investigate the location
of the ghost loop.

230
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:57,455
Where is this entity

231
00:10:57,457 --> 00:11:00,558
that violently pushes lee
on the steps?

232
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,130
"it's on the stairs."

233
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:13,371
the back of my head is, like,
it's a headache right now.

234
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:19,511
- Are you good?
- It's like shots of a headache.

235
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:20,812
Speak to us.

236
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,251
You want to push me
down the staircase?

237
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:29,120
I was just
standing there.

238
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:32,223
That's a coward's move.

239
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:34,859
You want to push somebody down
the stairs, call us out by name.

240
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:37,028
"matt."
that said "matt."

241
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,365
That sounded like
it said "matt."

242
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,867
do you like me laying
on this side of the bed?

243
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,169
Hold this.

244
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:50,208
Alright. This is where
lee hears you.

245
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,677
Who are you?

246
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,212
Where's the kid?

247
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,081
Kid?
Yeah. Where's the kid?

248
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:03,354
That sounded
like a kid.

249
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:07,292
"open the door."
- "open the door."

250
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:08,693
what door?

251
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:12,597
I'm gonna go back
this way, guys.

252
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:15,934
What door are
you talking about?

253
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:17,068
Nothing back here.

254
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,871
Yeah. Just the living room.
No doors in here.

255
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:23,875
Alright.
So, we're looking for a door.

256
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:26,878
It was remodeled, so --
top to bottom.

257
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,080
We get told by a spirit
to find a door,

258
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,548
which, always odd

259
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,550
to be directed by things
from the afterlife.

260
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:34,419
Before the renovation,
this,

261
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:35,787
where we're standing,
was a porch.

262
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:40,992
And I believe that this area,
right here, was the door.

263
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:42,761
Check over there.
There's a lot of cavities.

264
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,429
There's a secret
passage or something.

265
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,564
Yeah, dude. That's kind of
what I'm looking for.

266
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,032
You guys looked up here?

267
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:50,969
I mean, it's a big fireplace.
There's no door, right?

268
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:52,737
I'm not seeing anything.

269
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:57,342
Yeah. I don't think
there's anything here.

270
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:58,743
I think it's a bust, guys.

271
00:12:58,745 --> 00:12:59,878
Yeah.

272
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,947
I mean, maybe just one
more walk through, and...

273
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,082
I mean, I guess.

274
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:06,184
- Hey.
- What? What?

275
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:07,318
Get this
out of the way.

276
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,121
Dude. Hold on.

277
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,356
I mean,
it kind of blends in.

278
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:13,324
Hold on. Here we go.

279
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:20,064
Holy ****.
Are you kidding me?

280
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:22,100
Holy ****

281
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:23,234
dude.

282
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:24,903
That's a stairwell
going straight up, boys.

283
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:26,237
My god.
Let's go.

284
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,438
Here. Let's go.

285
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,676
This has got to be it.

286
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:39,083
we find a door
that leads up to the attic.

287
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:40,451
It was incredibly
unsettling,

288
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:44,989
and not something
I'm very fond of at this point.

289
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,191
What the hell?

290
00:13:57,871 --> 00:13:58,937
you alright?
Yeah.

291
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:00,238
Something went like that.

292
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,739
You say you just got pinched?
Swear to god.

293
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:03,308
Lift it up. Lift it up.
Lift it up.

294
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:06,711
There's no marks, right?

295
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:07,879
Where? Show me.
No.

296
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:08,847
It was right here.
Right here?

297
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:10,548
Yep.
It just looks like a pinch.

298
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,483
That seems like a really kid
thing to do.

299
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:13,952
Yeah. That's what
I was thinking.

300
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:17,388
Is this the little boy?

301
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,492
Is this the room
you wanted us to go to?

302
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,430
That sounded like
a little kid.

303
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:26,731
Hey, little one.

304
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:30,768
You can talk to us.
You don't have to be afraid.

305
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,170
We're here to help you.

306
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,206
Do you need
to be set free?

307
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:41,212
"release."

308
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,981
do you need
to be released?

309
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,218
Do you want
to be released?

310
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,521
Which one of us do you feel most
comfortable communicating with?

311
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:51,823
Me?

312
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,893
What about matt?

313
00:14:58,698 --> 00:14:59,898
My god.

314
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,033
It literally just said,
"here you go, matt."

315
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:04,736
hey, little boy,
are you here?

316
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:05,904
Are you good?

317
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:13,144
Little kid just said, "no."
dude, they are talking now.

318
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:15,580
I think he was afraid
because we were all standing up.

319
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,382
Tell us your name,
little guy.

320
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:23,988
What did that say?

321
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,456
I heard
"albert" very clear.

322
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,892
Is that your name?
Albert?

323
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:32,664
"albert."

324
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:36,134
knowing that there's a child
that's lost here,

325
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:37,936
it makes me sad.

326
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:40,638
We're gonna have to find out
more tomorrow night.

327
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,873
Yeah.

328
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,875
We've got a giant,
giant pile of questions,

329
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:46,010
and very few answers,
right now.

330
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:49,981
With the preliminary
investigation over,

331
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:52,417
califf explains how
lee and garry's house

332
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:54,852
may have been used
on the underground railroad.

333
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:57,956
He meets with
lanesha debardelaben.

334
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,058
The underground railroad.
What was it?

335
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,794
The underground railroad
was literally

336
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:07,365
a network of support
for freedom seekers

337
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:10,902
during the period
of american slavery.

338
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:18,309
It was a collection of people
and places, homes,

339
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:24,248
churches for african americans
who were escaping slavery.

340
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:28,052
Some estimates state
over 100,000 freedom seekers

341
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:31,589
escaped to the free states
and canada by 1850.

342
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:34,892
Then, the government introduced
the fugitive slave act.

343
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:39,597
Once the
fugitive slave act passed,

344
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:43,201
it became profitable
for americans

345
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:47,905
to capture freedom seekers,
and to return them to slavery.

346
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:52,276
And so, there was often
financial gain

347
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:55,980
for sometimes
tricking freedom seekers

348
00:16:55,982 --> 00:17:00,051
into thinking that
they were safe,

349
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:01,152
and being helped,

350
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:04,555
when in actuality,
they were being betrayed.

351
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:08,026
When lee and garry's home
was a tavern in the 1860s,

352
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:10,428
it was rumored to be a stop
on the railroad.

353
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,196
But the tavern owners
at the time,

354
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,865
sarah and joseph kinsell,

355
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,768
sold the freedom seekers
back into slavery.

356
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:19,404
Califf speaks to local historian
david wiles.

357
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:20,505
Hi. I'm david.
How are you?

358
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:22,673
Pleasure to meet you, david.
Let's go inside.

359
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,177
Do you know any of the history
about that particular location?

360
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:27,178
A little bit.

361
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,715
The house was build
by joseph kinsell.

362
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:35,219
He had 16 slaves that he used
to build the house,

363
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:38,256
and then, afterwards, he sold
all the slaves, but kept one.

364
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:40,024
Is there anything special
about that one particular slave

365
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:41,359
that he kept?

366
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:45,263
I don't know, other than
his name was albert.

367
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:48,166
And nothing more
about it,

368
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:50,034
except that he was kept
in the family.

369
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:52,170
I can't believe this.
I'm blown away.

370
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:53,805
Albert is the name
of the little boy spirit

371
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:55,273
we heard in the attic.

372
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:57,041
Tell us your name,
little guy.

373
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:02,213
"albert."

374
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:05,216
albert, a few years later,
did die,

375
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:09,087
and he was buried in one
of the caves behind the house.

376
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,922
There's a lot of caves
in the area,

377
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,790
because of all
the limestone.

378
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,358
Is there anything else
that you think I should know

379
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,627
about this town,
as far as that property,

380
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:17,762
the stretch of road?

381
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,064
It is well known in the area
for being haunted.

382
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:21,799
How far back does that go?
Do you know?

383
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:24,735
Well, I heard it
from my grandparents.

384
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:26,571
So, they were born
in the 1890's.

385
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:28,606
I mean, it was always
passed down that,

386
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:29,740
"that house is haunted."

387
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:32,110
so, this house
has a history?

388
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:35,546
The house just saw endless
activity of stagecoaches

389
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:36,981
and covered wagons.

390
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:39,817
But you also had the mixture
of good and bad travelers,

391
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:42,120
and card games, and whiskey.

392
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:44,689
There was a story that there
was a card fight, or something,

393
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:47,658
and there was a murder
in the house at one time.

394
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,327
There was a murder
in the house?

395
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:50,461
In the house.

396
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:02,773
In clear spring, maryland,
the spirit hunters have been

397
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:04,375
following a lead
their ghost loop

398
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:06,310
might be connected
to a little boy

399
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,579
from the
underground railroad.

400
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:10,348
Tell us your name,
little guy.

401
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:14,385
I heard "albert."

402
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:18,389
But after speaking with
local historian david wiles,

403
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:20,725
lee and garry's home that was
originally a tavern

404
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:25,796
built in 1803 might have
more secrets to divulge.

405
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:27,832
There was a murder
in the house at one time.

406
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,600
There was a murder
in the house?

407
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:31,569
Odd, but they say
that the dead man

408
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:34,605
is still buried
under the front door.

409
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,774
The person
that was murdered

410
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:38,676
is buried under the front door
of that property.

411
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:41,245
That's the story that that
was always passed down, yes.

412
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:42,480
There's just no details.

413
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:45,650
It's just a story that's
been in the area forever.

414
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:52,056
Sean and kris asked lee and
garry about the rumored murder.

415
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:53,591
There was a traveler.

416
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:55,960
He stayed here
when this was an inn.

417
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:59,230
And the tavern keeper
and his wife got him drunk,

418
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:03,367
and killed him, and buried him
under the kitchen floor,

419
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:06,437
under a stone
that's under the kitchen floor.

420
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:07,972
According to local folklore,

421
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:09,907
the innkeepers had murdered
the traveler

422
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:12,476
for the gold he brought back
from the territory.

423
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:13,911
But they never found it.

424
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:17,915
So, there is a body possibly
buried under the home,

425
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:20,785
and gold that was buried on the
property that nobody's found.

426
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:22,019
Right.

427
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:25,623
That's the legend.
That's the story.

428
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:29,193
With this new lead
pointing to the innkeepers,

429
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:33,564
kris, sean, and eric returned
to the site of the ghost loop.

430
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,899
Alright, guys,
I have an idea.

431
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,234
Want to set it up
on the stairs.

432
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:37,401
Yep.

433
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:41,339
Are we communicating
with the man

434
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:44,141
that was murdered
by the innkeepers?

435
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,549
Are we communicating
with the innkeepers?

436
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:54,752
This is incredible.
Direct line of communication.

437
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,521
You'd think it would be
the murdered man that was here,

438
00:20:57,523 --> 00:20:59,156
but it's the innkeepers.

439
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:02,326
Maybe they're still
looking for the gold.

440
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:05,796
Is that why you bring lee
to the stairs here?

441
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:08,833
Because you want to bring her to
that moment that you murdered,

442
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:11,235
when it was a tavern,
for your gold?

443
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:17,008
<i> Is that why you bring the lee</i>
<i> to the stairs here?</i>

444
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:23,080
- "my gold."
- "my gold."
- "my gold."

445
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:25,950
my god.
- My god.

446
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:27,351
Holy ****.

447
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:28,953
Said "my gold."

448
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:32,223
this area, right here,
is where the tavern was.

449
00:21:32,225 --> 00:21:33,591
They got him drunk.

450
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:37,695
They murdered him for his gold,
and then buried his body

451
00:21:37,697 --> 00:21:39,630
somewhere on this property,
under this house.

452
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,899
That's incredible.
It's all coming together now.

453
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:44,869
Do you want us
to find your gold?

454
00:21:44,871 --> 00:21:46,337
Touch the device.

455
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:50,241
Interesting.

456
00:21:50,243 --> 00:21:51,642
Maybe he doesn't want
anyone to find it.

457
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:55,112
Do you not want anyone to find
your gold, because it's yours?

458
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:01,852
My gosh.

459
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:05,156
Do you know of the little boy,
the african american boy?

460
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:06,657
Is he here in the house
with you?

461
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:07,958
Touch the device.

462
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:12,396
Is he with matt
and califf outside?

463
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:15,032
- Wow.
- Wow.

464
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:21,038
Little boy, did you communicate
with us in the house?

465
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,907
Are you out here
with us right now?

466
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:27,978
You can use my energy,
as well, little boy.

467
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,447
Only the little boy.

468
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:34,885
How are you feeling?

469
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:36,120
You alright?

470
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:40,825
You need a minute?

471
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:43,861
Talk to me.

472
00:22:45,565 --> 00:22:48,065
I'm just --
dude, I'm sorry. ****

473
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:49,266
what's going on?

474
00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:54,171
I just asked him to use
my energy, man.

475
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:56,340
I just, it's sad, dude.

476
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:58,309
It's a hopeless feeling.

477
00:23:01,147 --> 00:23:02,279
Let's go down.

478
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:06,717
God.
That was emotional, man.

479
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,553
My god.

480
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,322
It was wrong.
It was gross.

481
00:23:11,324 --> 00:23:13,924
It was a feeling -- like I said,
it's a feeling I don't ever,

482
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:15,126
ever want to feel again.

483
00:23:15,128 --> 00:23:18,329
It was bad, dude.
It was bad.

484
00:23:18,331 --> 00:23:19,797
What?

485
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,934
I don't think the little boy's
out here right now.

486
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:25,970
I do not.

487
00:23:25,972 --> 00:23:28,806
Are you the innkeepers?

488
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:30,775
Make that go off
if you are.

489
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:36,947
Back away.

490
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:42,119
Do you want to harm
lee and garry?

491
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:44,789
Are you the ones pushing
them down the stairs?

492
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:55,132
back away.

493
00:23:56,903 --> 00:23:58,502
Back away.

494
00:23:58,504 --> 00:24:00,104
Is your name joseph?

495
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:06,911
Or is this sarah?

496
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:14,018
dude. My god.

497
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:17,822
This is the most intelligent
rem pod action

498
00:24:17,824 --> 00:24:19,824
that we've gotten
in a while.

499
00:24:19,826 --> 00:24:21,325
Ask if joseph's here
again, dude.

500
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:22,326
Joseph's got to be here.

501
00:24:22,328 --> 00:24:23,761
Sarah, is joseph with you?

502
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:26,497
Look.

503
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:30,334
fire up the spirit box.

504
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:31,869
Dude.

505
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:33,003
Okay.

506
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:38,843
Joseph, sarah ann,
are you guys with us?

507
00:24:38,845 --> 00:24:41,345
You talked to us
on the rem pod.

508
00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:43,347
Bro!

509
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:45,049
It said "sarah."

510
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:48,018
it said "sarah"
in a female voice.

511
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,154
Do you know what's
happening in the house?

512
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:53,023
"murder"?

513
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:54,191
Murder.

514
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:04,935
The spirit hunters
discover a murder was committed

515
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:07,538
at lee and garry's house
by tavern keepers

516
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:11,141
sarah and joseph kinsell,
in the early 1800s.

517
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:13,344
There was a traveler,
and the tavern keeper

518
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:14,678
and his wife killed him,

519
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,181
and buried him
under the kitchen floor.

520
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:20,317
Later, joseph died
falling drunk off a wagon,

521
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:23,854
while sarah died of natural
causes 30 years later.

522
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:27,157
Now, sarah and joseph
are trapped in a ghost loop.

523
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:29,326
They whisper
to lure lee out,

524
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:31,028
so they can push her
down the stairs,

525
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,798
obsessed with protecting
the missing stolen gold.

526
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,302
<i> Is that why you bring lee</i>
<i> to the stairs here?</i>

527
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:41,338
- "my gold."
- "my gold."

528
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,608
they murdered him
for his gold

529
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,977
and then, buried his body
somewhere on this property.

530
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:48,879
It's all coming
together, now.

531
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:53,517
Outside, matt and califf
keep up contact with sarah.

532
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:57,788
Sarah, did you do
the killing?

533
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:04,361
my god.

534
00:26:04,363 --> 00:26:06,230
She was more evil
than him, bro.

535
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:07,665
That's what
I'm sensing.

536
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:09,800
Do you still want
to kill?

537
00:26:14,507 --> 00:26:17,441
Suddenly,
the spirit goes silent.

538
00:26:25,318 --> 00:26:26,750
Let's get the hell
out of here, dude.

539
00:26:28,955 --> 00:26:31,822
Back at the house,
sean, eric, and kris,

540
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:33,290
investigate
where the spirits

541
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:35,459
whispering begins
the ghost loop.

542
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:37,428
How did you murder
this man?

543
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:41,599
Was he shot?

544
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,070
Was he pushed
down the stairs?

545
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,708
My god.

546
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,776
Do you regret
murdering that man?

547
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:53,944
Touch the device.

548
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:02,019
Did you mean to kill him
'cause you wanted his gold?

549
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:03,487
Wow.

550
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:06,056
That's insane.

551
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:08,292
Are you still looking
for this man's gold?

552
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:09,960
Touch the device
on the table.

553
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:16,033
what was that?
What was that?

554
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:18,102
It just knocked
on the table.

555
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:21,338
****
okay.

556
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:25,109
Is that sarah?

557
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:28,412
"yeah."

558
00:27:28,414 --> 00:27:30,214
wow.

559
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:32,716
It said "yep,"
and then, that went off.

560
00:27:32,718 --> 00:27:34,418
Sarah, do you
want our help?

561
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:40,891
She also needs
our help, guys.

562
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:42,693
Dude, it's going crazy.

563
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:49,466
Now that all the evidence
is in,

564
00:27:49,468 --> 00:27:52,202
the team discusses
how to move forward.

565
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:55,205
The elements of gold
in our story, here, guys,

566
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:57,441
it's so prevalent.
It's so profound.

567
00:27:57,443 --> 00:27:59,877
I know that we caught
"my gold."

568
00:27:59,879 --> 00:28:00,878
we all heard it.

569
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,248
- "my gold."
- "my gold."

570
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,350
they murdered the man
for his gold,

571
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:09,153
and they really didn't have
any remorse about it.

572
00:28:09,155 --> 00:28:12,723
Did you mean to kill him
because you wanted his gold?

573
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:13,991
Wow.

574
00:28:13,993 --> 00:28:15,759
I mean, I kind of feel like
sarah's the culprit, here.

575
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:17,227
Okay.
I'm going with that, too.

576
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:18,262
We were up there
on the hill,

577
00:28:18,264 --> 00:28:19,430
and we were talking
to the rem pod,

578
00:28:19,432 --> 00:28:22,166
and we literally asked,
"did you do this?"

579
00:28:22,168 --> 00:28:24,868
sarah, did you
do the killing?

580
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:28,172
we were in
the dining room.

581
00:28:28,174 --> 00:28:30,107
We were asking,
"are you responsible

582
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:32,643
sarah, for the push
on the stairs?"

583
00:28:32,645 --> 00:28:37,748
sarah, are you the one trying
to push lee down the stairs?

584
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,616
126.4.
Stop it.

585
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:40,651
Holy.

586
00:28:40,653 --> 00:28:43,120
What if they think lee
is after their gold,

587
00:28:43,122 --> 00:28:45,289
and that is why she's feeling
that push down the stairs.

588
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:47,558
Like, now they're
after her, as well.

589
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,760
Are you still looking
for this man's gold?

590
00:28:49,762 --> 00:28:51,962
Touch the device
on the table.

591
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,598
what was that?

592
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,400
It just knocked
on the table.

593
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:57,468
And it's interesting.

594
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,802
We actually asked
if she wanted our help,

595
00:28:58,804 --> 00:29:00,370
and the thing went crazy.

596
00:29:00,372 --> 00:29:02,573
Sarah, do you want
our help?

597
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:04,074
40.9.

598
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,477
She also needs
our help, guys.

599
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:08,011
How does she
want our help?

600
00:29:08,013 --> 00:29:09,713
Does she want our help
to be released

601
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:11,381
or she want to help
finding this gold.

602
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:12,783
- Right.
- Exactly.

603
00:29:13,786 --> 00:29:17,087
History backs that.
In fact, sarah ann and joseph

604
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:20,023
kept a slave --
a young boy named albert.

605
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:22,392
He sold all the slaves,
but kept one.

606
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:24,628
He was kept in the family.

607
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,564
His name was albert and...

608
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:28,866
When we got to the attic,

609
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:30,534
it said, "albert",
through the spirit box.

610
00:29:30,536 --> 00:29:32,236
Tell us your name,
little guy.

611
00:29:35,074 --> 00:29:36,540
So, they kept this boy,
they treated him

612
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:38,642
as one of his own,
but for the time,

613
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:40,944
if people came over or came by,
you couldn't have him present,

614
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,112
so they'd hide him
in the tunnel.

615
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,014
And something we also got
during that night,

616
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:46,049
right, when I was standing
over the area of the tunnel.

617
00:29:46,051 --> 00:29:47,084
It's crazy.

618
00:29:47,086 --> 00:29:48,252
And I'm like,
"did you hide down here?"

619
00:29:48,254 --> 00:29:50,554
is this where you went
to go hide all the time?

620
00:29:50,556 --> 00:29:51,688
"I did."

621
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,524
albert died in the tunnel
under the house.

622
00:29:53,526 --> 00:29:54,691
I mean, there was
a possibility

623
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:56,727
that albert was treated
awfully by these people.

624
00:29:56,729 --> 00:29:59,163
I mean, we saw how they treated
the other 16 slaves

625
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:00,764
that were on their property --
sold them back to their owners.

626
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:03,100
I feel like the little boy
is ready.

627
00:30:03,102 --> 00:30:04,301
He knows
our intentions.

628
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:05,536
He knows that we're here
to help him.

629
00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:07,771
It's been a really long time.
I think he's ready.

630
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:09,306
Well, think about it, he's been
kind of a guiding light

631
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:10,407
for us all, right?

632
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:12,176
He's been the one
showing us to places,

633
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:13,977
helping us out, trying
to figure out more answers.

634
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:16,446
So, I think that he wants us
to put this puzzle together,

635
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:17,948
so that way,
he can go.

636
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,551
There's no doubt that albert is
attached to the innkeepers,

637
00:30:20,553 --> 00:30:22,786
who clearly don't want
to leave this place.

638
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:24,254
If we get rid
of the innkeepers,

639
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:27,124
then, we'll be able
to release albert.

640
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:29,092
It all makes sense now.
It really does.

641
00:30:29,094 --> 00:30:31,495
Leading us tonight
to our trigger

642
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:32,529
and environment room.

643
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:33,463
And eric.

644
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:34,965
What stands out
the most for me,

645
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:37,067
these innkeepers are here
for the gold.

646
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:39,536
So, I have a box
with a bag of gold in it.

647
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:41,205
Considering what we have
for a trigger environment,

648
00:30:41,207 --> 00:30:43,407
why don't we bury the gold
somewhere on the property,

649
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:45,809
and see how they interact
with us while we do it.

650
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:47,744
'cause obviously,
that's a huge piece,

651
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:50,147
and core element
to what's going on here.

652
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:52,916
Alright, it's our trigger
environment evening, guys.

653
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:54,785
Let's end the ghost
loop of activity

654
00:30:54,787 --> 00:30:56,220
that garry and lee
are experiencing,

655
00:30:56,222 --> 00:30:58,088
so they can
live peacefully.

656
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:07,664
the main purpose of this night
is to lure all the spirits in.

657
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:10,868
For this trigger environment,
I'm transforming the dining room

658
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,903
into a tavern
from the 1800s.

659
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:19,943
there's various different
ash trays and bottles.

660
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:22,346
There's the cash register
in there.

661
00:31:22,348 --> 00:31:24,681
Most importantly
for this case,

662
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:27,651
I'm bringing in
two bags of gold.

663
00:31:27,653 --> 00:31:30,420
I guarantee these items
will lure

664
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:33,857
sarah and joseph
into the open.

665
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:36,159
Albert, can you
touch my hand again?

666
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:37,394
Hold my hand.

667
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:41,899
my god. He's literally
grabbing your hand.

668
00:31:51,944 --> 00:31:53,610
The spirit hunters
have identified

669
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:56,380
the ghost loop as
sarah and joseph kinsell --

670
00:31:56,382 --> 00:31:59,416
murderous innkeepers who are
still searching for the gold

671
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:01,285
they killed for.

672
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:02,953
Refusing to move on,

673
00:32:02,955 --> 00:32:05,856
the kinsells are also holding
back a little boy spirit,

674
00:32:05,858 --> 00:32:09,393
albert,
that they kept in real life.

675
00:32:09,395 --> 00:32:11,295
Albert has been aiding
the spirit hunters,

676
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:13,297
so he can move on.

677
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:15,632
So, eric has built
a trigger environment

678
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:18,302
to emulate the tavern
from the 1850's,

679
00:32:18,304 --> 00:32:19,836
to lure the spirits in,

680
00:32:19,838 --> 00:32:22,205
so the team can
cross them all over.

681
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:23,540
Amazing job with this
trigger environment.

682
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:25,575
It literally
looks like a tavern.

683
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:28,512
It's what these spirits think,
that it really is a tavern.

684
00:32:28,514 --> 00:32:30,213
So, let's see
if they interact with us

685
00:32:30,215 --> 00:32:32,716
as if we were one of the patrons
of the tavern tonight.

686
00:32:32,718 --> 00:32:33,717
Hell, yeah.

687
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:34,985
Guys, I'm ready to help
lee and garry.

688
00:32:34,987 --> 00:32:37,421
Let's break this ghost loop.

689
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:47,831
sarah and joseph,
we're looking for you

690
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:49,132
to communicate
with you tonight.

691
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:50,867
Can you please
come forward?

692
00:32:56,108 --> 00:32:57,774
Sarah,
are you here with us?

693
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:05,816
We know what you did the night
that you met the traveler.

694
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:08,118
You murdered him
for his gold.

695
00:33:09,455 --> 00:33:11,555
"they're inside."

696
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:15,225
we have some gold sitting
over there in that chair.

697
00:33:15,227 --> 00:33:17,094
How do you like
the look of that?

698
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,464
I have your gold.

699
00:33:20,466 --> 00:33:22,733
It's right here.

700
00:33:22,735 --> 00:33:24,267
I'm taking all of it.

701
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:30,674
Right. So, we're going to put
your gold back on the table.

702
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:32,075
This is for you.

703
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:37,881
as soon as we put
the gold down on the table.

704
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:42,419
Sarah, joseph, are you still
looking for this gold

705
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:44,087
that you took
from this man?

706
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:47,324
Can you make
that device light up.

707
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:52,129
my god.

708
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:54,464
I mean, it's clear
why they're still here.

709
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:57,134
Sarah's presence
is so strong.

710
00:33:57,136 --> 00:34:00,604
Sarah, are you responsible
for this man's murder?

711
00:34:02,941 --> 00:34:04,574
she has no problem
admitting that at all.

712
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:08,378
She is a bigger part
than what we even know.

713
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,982
If there are other people that
you've killed, touch the device.

714
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:23,393
That was
probably joseph.

715
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:26,830
He's here with us.

716
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,367
"she's mad at me?"

717
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:32,369
what is she
so mad at?

718
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:35,872
These spirits are reacting to
not only us,

719
00:34:35,874 --> 00:34:38,942
but to each other,
on the other side.

720
00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:40,744
Sarah feels guilty.

721
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:43,113
Sarah feels guilty.
She probably does.

722
00:34:43,115 --> 00:34:45,649
Maybe joseph didn't fall off
that carriage when he died.

723
00:34:45,651 --> 00:34:46,850
Maybe he got
a little...

724
00:34:46,852 --> 00:34:48,618
Push.

725
00:34:49,655 --> 00:34:52,389
My, god, dude.
Are you serious?

726
00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:54,925
My god, dude.

727
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:57,494
Okay. Okay.

728
00:34:57,496 --> 00:34:59,262
I had an epiphany,
we're in here talking.

729
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:03,066
So, I started thinking, what if
sarah was an awful person,

730
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:04,901
and maybe, when he was drinking
on that carriage,

731
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:07,571
he didn't fall off.
Maybe he got a little...

732
00:35:07,573 --> 00:35:08,705
Push.

733
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:11,308
that's going off.

734
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:14,177
We're talking about it.
She hears us.

735
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:15,378
Alright.
Let's get back in there.

736
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,813
Go, go, go.

737
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:19,916
My god.

738
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:22,519
Sarah. Thank you.
Please back away.

739
00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:24,187
We have a question
for you.

740
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:28,058
my god.

741
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:31,828
Maybe she is upset because she
accidentally killed her husband.

742
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,564
Sarah, did you accidentally
kill your husband?

743
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:37,134
It wasn't an accident.
She did it on purpose.

744
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:39,769
Sarah, did you mean
to kill your husband?

745
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,143
Are you serious, dude?

746
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:49,613
My god.

747
00:35:49,615 --> 00:35:51,948
I was starting to feel
something.

748
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:56,286
Sarah, how did you
kill your husband?

749
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,654
What did you do?

750
00:35:58,724 --> 00:36:01,291
"pushed him."
"pushed him.'

751
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:03,660
With the entire team
in the room,

752
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:05,729
the spirit energy escalates.

753
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:08,999
What happened to albert?

754
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:10,967
My god.

755
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:14,404
It just felt like
somebody pushed into me.

756
00:36:14,406 --> 00:36:17,908
Albert, did you just
push into kris?

757
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:21,144
- Kris.
- It just said "kris."

758
00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:24,147
albert, if you're here,
can you touch the device?

759
00:36:26,218 --> 00:36:27,517
my god, dude.

760
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:29,686
Albert, is that you?

761
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:30,687
Albert.

762
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:34,758
Right by you, kris.
Don't move.

763
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:48,738
The spirit hunters have drawn
out the conspiring murderers,

764
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:52,042
sarah and joseph kinsell
to the trigger environment.

765
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:53,977
But they've also
brought out albert,

766
00:36:53,979 --> 00:36:57,013
the little boy who has been
guiding the team along the way,

767
00:36:57,015 --> 00:36:59,449
and desperately wants
to cross over.

768
00:37:02,354 --> 00:37:05,121
Right behind you, kris.
Don't move.

769
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:06,189
My gosh.

770
00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:07,624
My god.
It's a little kid.

771
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:10,060
It's right there.
It's right there behind you.

772
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:12,529
- Albert.
- My gosh.

773
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:13,597
Right where your hand is.

774
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,865
Albert, can you touch
my hand again?

775
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:17,000
Hold my hand.

776
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:23,573
my god. He's literally
grabbing your hand.

777
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,842
My --
my god.

778
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:26,977
It's gone.

779
00:37:26,979 --> 00:37:31,348
My god, guys.

780
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:34,784
I just find it just to be
a very touching situation,

781
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:37,554
just knowing that
I'm able to help him.

782
00:37:37,556 --> 00:37:41,258
He's ready, he's willing,
and he wants to go now.

783
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,459
Alright guys,
we've got to figure out

784
00:37:42,461 --> 00:37:44,027
how to break this loop.

785
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:45,161
Be careful.

786
00:37:45,163 --> 00:37:46,630
Well, keep in mind joseph
isn't gonna go easily.

787
00:37:46,632 --> 00:37:49,733
Right? No. I think him and sarah
both are unwilling.

788
00:37:49,735 --> 00:37:54,304
They're both still here,
having no closure,

789
00:37:54,306 --> 00:37:55,739
because they can't
find this.

790
00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:56,940
So, what you want to do
about that, matt?

791
00:37:56,942 --> 00:37:58,842
I want to bury this.

792
00:37:58,844 --> 00:38:01,111
All of the gold
we brought for them.

793
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:03,380
Absolutely.
Of course.

794
00:38:03,382 --> 00:38:05,782
Alright. We're gonna go outside,
bury this gold.

795
00:38:12,591 --> 00:38:16,926
I want the little boy,
albert, joseph, and sarah

796
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:20,063
you want to go to the light.
You're ready. All of you.

797
00:38:20,065 --> 00:38:25,135
We know what you did,
but we're not here to judge you.

798
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:29,239
You have to trust us.
You have to come forward.

799
00:38:29,241 --> 00:38:33,743
It's time to let go of
the human life that you lived.

800
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:35,178
Up here, matt.

801
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,180
Yes, sir.

802
00:38:37,182 --> 00:38:40,383
Right where we communicated
with them last night.

803
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:42,619
Do you want
to cross over?

804
00:38:43,622 --> 00:38:47,390
"yes."
follow our voice.

805
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:52,429
Joseph and sarah ann,
this is now your gold.

806
00:38:52,431 --> 00:38:56,299
We're going to bury it
right here.

807
00:38:56,301 --> 00:39:00,136
Califf and matt hope that,
by using the gold as bait,

808
00:39:00,138 --> 00:39:04,274
it will appease sarah and joseph
enough to cross them over.

809
00:39:04,276 --> 00:39:07,377
This is the last call
at the bar.

810
00:39:07,379 --> 00:39:13,983
Your gold is found, so come get
it, and leave this property.

811
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:17,987
Albert, you can take my hand,
and I can help you.

812
00:39:20,092 --> 00:39:21,524
It's working.

813
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,827
Is everyone here,
and ready to go?

814
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:26,463
- "let's go."
- "let's go."

815
00:39:26,465 --> 00:39:27,664
our father,
who art in heaven.

816
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:29,232
Hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come,

817
00:39:29,234 --> 00:39:31,067
thy will be done,
on earth as in heaven.

818
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:32,869
For each one
of the lives you took,

819
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:35,238
and for every bad thing
that you did...

820
00:39:37,142 --> 00:39:38,775
...I still hope
you find peace.

821
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,346
Give us, this day,
our daily bread,

822
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:45,215
and forgive us
our trespasses,

823
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:47,283
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

824
00:39:47,285 --> 00:39:50,320
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us all from evil.

825
00:39:51,356 --> 00:39:52,822
Holy mary,
mother of god,

826
00:39:52,824 --> 00:39:55,759
pray for us sinners, now until
the hour of our death, amen.

827
00:39:55,761 --> 00:39:56,793
- "amen."
- "amen!"

828
00:39:56,795 --> 00:39:58,027
at the same time!

829
00:39:59,698 --> 00:40:00,897
My god.

830
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:12,142
"thank you."

831
00:40:12,144 --> 00:40:13,376
I mean,
I'm speechless.

832
00:40:13,378 --> 00:40:15,612
Feels lighter in here.
Like, I really --

833
00:40:15,614 --> 00:40:16,813
I think this is over.

834
00:40:16,815 --> 00:40:18,181
I truly feel that.

835
00:40:25,657 --> 00:40:26,756
good work, my brother.

836
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:37,534
It's quite the mystery
that you to moved into, here.

837
00:40:37,536 --> 00:40:39,702
We want to know how
things went, naturally.

838
00:40:39,704 --> 00:40:41,771
What we truly believe,
why you've been lured out

839
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,907
to those stairs
so many evenings,

840
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:45,842
is because you've been
hearing these whispers.

841
00:40:45,844 --> 00:40:47,310
And what those
whispers are,

842
00:40:47,312 --> 00:40:49,612
are conspiring voices
of that night

843
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:52,515
they plotted to kill
this man for his gold.

844
00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:55,618
And that's what ultimately led
us to our trigger environment.

845
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:58,321
Eric actually built this
phenomenal trigger environment.

846
00:40:58,323 --> 00:41:00,423
We went back in time,
into the 1800s,

847
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:03,259
and we built
this tavern.

848
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:04,994
So, did they cross over?

849
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:06,863
Yes. We absolutely believe
that happened.

850
00:41:06,865 --> 00:41:08,631
- Fantastic.
-100%.

851
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:09,666
Fantastic.

852
00:41:09,668 --> 00:41:10,900
The most amazing experience,

853
00:41:10,902 --> 00:41:12,836
when we were in the
trigger environment,

854
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:14,938
while these spirits
were being crossed over,

855
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,407
they actually ended the prayer
with us in sync.

856
00:41:17,409 --> 00:41:19,442
They said "amen"
with us.

857
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:21,177
My gosh.

858
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:23,346
'cause we've been asked
if it's haunted.

859
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:24,447
And so, we would --

860
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:26,583
we would like
to truthfully say "no."

861
00:41:26,585 --> 00:41:29,085
right. And now,
you can finally do that.

862
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:32,088
Thank you so much for helping
these spirits move on.

863
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,990
Thank you for giving us
peace of mind.

864
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:37,227
I'm going to miss
the little boy a little bit,

865
00:41:37,229 --> 00:41:39,929
but I'm happy to know
that he's also moved on.

866
00:41:39,931 --> 00:41:42,065
I can't tell you
what a relief it is.

867

Lee is the most precious thing
in my life, and I --

00:41:48,473 --> 00:41:50,340
and I'm grateful
that your team

870
00:41:50,342 --> 00:41:54,511
was able to send
these spirits packing.

1
00:01:22,761 --> 00:01:26,356
Three more womens' bodies found!

2
00:01:32,804 --> 00:01:35,440
More murders in Juarez!

3
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,143
Juarez terrorized
by wave of killings!

4
00:01:38,143 --> 00:01:41,546
Three more womens' bodies found!

5
00:01:41,546 --> 00:01:44,743
Get the truth,
read about it in El Sol.

6
00:08:13,404 --> 00:08:14,672
Over the last few years...

7
00:08:14,672 --> 00:08:17,809
375 Mexican women
have been raped and murdered.

8
00:08:17,809 --> 00:08:21,512
An additional 700 Mexican women
are still missing.

9
00:08:21,512 --> 00:08:24,504
No one knows who,
no one knows why.

10
00:08:24,816 --> 00:08:26,451
You wanna find out?

11
00:08:26,451 --> 00:08:29,721
- Nobody gives a shit about Mexico.
- Lf you give a shit, they will.

12
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:32,090
- Okay!
- Just get to the heart of the story!

13
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,092
You used to work
for the El Paso Courier, right?

14
00:08:34,092 --> 00:08:36,227
- What does that have to do with it?
- You speak enough Spanish.

15
00:08:36,227 --> 00:08:38,496
I don't speak Spanish.
I don't know anything about Mexico.

16
00:08:38,496 --> 00:08:40,698
- What was the name of your partner?
- Diaz.

17
00:08:40,698 --> 00:08:43,034
Alfonso Diaz. You guys
were wonderful together.

18
00:08:43,034 --> 00:08:46,437
You won the JFK medal, right?
I'm really trying to help you out.

19
00:08:46,437 --> 00:08:49,941
- But you're so goddamned mighty!
- All right!

20
00:08:49,941 --> 00:08:51,976
I'll do it. But when I do...

21
00:08:51,976 --> 00:08:54,501
I want the foreign
correspondence job. Deal?

22
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,445
Yeah, why not?

23
00:08:58,249 --> 00:08:59,944
I'll leave tonight.

24
00:11:02,173 --> 00:11:04,141
Ma'am? We've arrived.

25
00:11:15,887 --> 00:11:17,655
How are you, Lauren?
This is Frank.

26
00:11:17,655 --> 00:11:20,625
- Hey, Frank.
- I thought I'd give you the heads-up.

27
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,660
George is looking for you.
He's pissed.

28
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,862
You were supposed to call him
the second you landed in Juarez.

29
00:11:24,862 --> 00:11:27,592
Hope you're having a blast down there.
Hold on for Frank.

30
00:11:28,633 --> 00:11:30,601
What the hell is going on?

31
00:11:30,601 --> 00:11:33,971
George. Did you know that they are
claiming that the murders are solved?

32
00:11:33,971 --> 00:11:39,204
The police have some guy in custody.
Some Egyptian guy. His name is...

33
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,379
Al-Awar.

34
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:45,983
It's bullshit. It's different
patterns with the different victims.

35
00:11:45,983 --> 00:11:47,785
Some are strangled
with shoelaces.

36
00:11:47,785 --> 00:11:50,721
Others have bite marks
on their breasts.

37
00:11:50,721 --> 00:11:53,324
- You know, it's not anything.
- It sounds you're onto something...

38
00:11:53,324 --> 00:11:57,361
Don't forget what you promised me.
I want the foreign correspondent job.

39
00:11:57,361 --> 00:12:00,731
One job at a time, kid.
You stay focused.

40
00:12:00,731 --> 00:12:02,699
We'll talk about it
when you get home.

41
00:12:58,823 --> 00:13:02,760
Hi, can I speak
to Alfonso Diaz, please?

42
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,955
This is the Chicago Sentinel.

43
00:13:10,868 --> 00:13:13,200
- Diaz?
- Who's this?

44
00:13:16,274 --> 00:13:17,832
This is Lauren.

45
00:13:18,309 --> 00:13:21,676
Lauren Adrian?
Remember?

46
00:13:22,747 --> 00:13:24,715
- Lauren?
- Yeah.

47
00:13:24,715 --> 00:13:27,707
I mean, it can't be.

48
00:13:28,085 --> 00:13:30,781
Where are you calling from?
Chicago?

49
00:13:32,723 --> 00:13:34,782
Actually I'm here.

50
00:13:36,794 --> 00:13:38,284
I'm in Juarez.

51
00:14:18,235 --> 00:14:19,327
My...

52
00:14:19,837 --> 00:14:20,769
Fuck.

53
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:34,819
Excuse me? Excuse me?

54
00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:37,014
Lotte Bravo?

55
00:14:38,489 --> 00:14:41,151
Straight? Okay.
Gracias.

56
00:15:22,566 --> 00:15:24,898
Lauren? Is that you?

57
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,096
It's me.

58
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,332
It's you.

59
00:15:32,576 --> 00:15:34,078
I can't believe it.

60
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:37,206
- You look good.
- You look good, too.

61
00:15:38,215 --> 00:15:41,852
I was surprised when you called.
I thought I'd never see you again.

62
00:15:41,852 --> 00:15:46,880
Maybe you're on CNN
and not here in Juarez.

63
00:15:47,191 --> 00:15:49,091
It has been a long time,
hasn't it?

64
00:15:55,866 --> 00:15:58,469
- What are they doing?
- They're looking for bodies.

65
00:15:58,469 --> 00:15:59,970
Their daughters.

66
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:03,607
They're the only ones who can find
bodies. Police didn't find anything.

67
00:16:03,607 --> 00:16:07,244
Authorities, well, they're trying
to cover the whole thing up.

68
00:16:07,244 --> 00:16:09,212
- Yeah.
- Anyway.

69
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,308
What are you doing here?

70
00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:16,020
I'm doing a story on the murders.

71
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,521
- There's always a story with you.
- It's not like that.

72
00:16:17,521 --> 00:16:20,891
- Yeah, you always want something.
- I don't want anything.

73
00:16:20,891 --> 00:16:23,694
It's something that I think
we need to do, together.

74
00:16:23,694 --> 00:16:25,958
- I gotta go and find these pictures.
- Come on.

75
00:16:27,898 --> 00:16:29,490
Team up with me.

76
00:16:30,434 --> 00:16:32,959
It'll be like old times.

77
00:16:33,537 --> 00:16:34,902
Old times?

78
00:16:37,107 --> 00:16:39,166
That is exactly
what I want to avoid.

79
00:16:43,914 --> 00:16:44,938
Shit.

80
00:16:47,251 --> 00:16:48,411
Diaz!

81
00:17:25,122 --> 00:17:27,056
Hold on. Wait up!

82
00:17:27,992 --> 00:17:30,294
You can't come here for six years
and expect me to help you.

83
00:17:30,294 --> 00:17:32,997
- You're happy to see me, I can tell.
- Yeah, sure.

84
00:17:32,997 --> 00:17:36,524
I need an inside contact, someone
who knows this world the way you do.

85
00:17:37,101 --> 00:17:40,337
My God, what happened here?
What are these, bullet holes?

86
00:17:40,337 --> 00:17:42,931
The price for telling the truth
in Juarez.

87
00:17:43,407 --> 00:17:45,075
You are a great
investigative reporter.

88
00:17:45,075 --> 00:17:47,444
One of the best when we
worked together in El Paso.

89
00:17:47,444 --> 00:17:50,413
- What are you doing in this place?
- Alfonso!

90
00:17:57,087 --> 00:17:58,522
- This is getting crazy.
- What?

91
00:17:58,522 --> 00:18:01,058
The Indians believe that the devil
himself is doing these murders.

92
00:18:01,058 --> 00:18:02,259
- The devil?
- Yeah.

93
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:05,062
And they hand us
these reports all the time.

94
00:18:05,062 --> 00:18:07,464
It changes shape every night.

95
00:18:07,464 --> 00:18:11,001
Some nights he's a dandy.
Some nights an old man.

96
00:18:11,001 --> 00:18:13,571
Keeps the women,
takes them to hell.

97
00:18:13,571 --> 00:18:17,974
According to this new report,
some girl escaped from the devil.

98
00:18:18,342 --> 00:18:21,345
Escaped?
Think there's anything to it?

99
00:18:21,345 --> 00:18:25,616
Who knows? There's nothing
but hysteria and rumors.

100
00:18:25,616 --> 00:18:28,052
Women are being used
for snuff films.

101
00:18:28,052 --> 00:18:31,589
People kill women, take their organs.
Serial killers come from everywhere.

102
00:18:31,589 --> 00:18:34,725
You wanna kill a woman
for any reason, you come to Juarez.

103
00:18:34,725 --> 00:18:37,127
Is there any evidence
to support any of these theories?

104
00:18:37,127 --> 00:18:39,296
Of course. There's evidence
to support all of them.

105
00:18:39,296 --> 00:18:42,094
They may all be true.
Lauren...

106
00:18:44,134 --> 00:18:47,705
the number of women killed
is not 375.

107
00:18:47,705 --> 00:18:50,741
It's just a number
the police concord up.

108
00:18:50,741 --> 00:18:54,142
But the real number is
probably closer to 5 thousand.

109
00:18:55,412 --> 00:18:56,743
Five thousand?

110
00:19:04,855 --> 00:19:06,447
Maybe it is the devil.

111
00:19:14,231 --> 00:19:15,755
I brought you something.

112
00:19:20,404 --> 00:19:22,031
Remember this?

113
00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:25,509
What?
We earned this together.

114
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:27,077
I know.

115
00:19:27,077 --> 00:19:30,080
- Take it.
- No, you keep it.

116
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,638
- You sure?
- Yeah.

117
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:43,783
- This is your family?
- Yeah.

118
00:19:45,195 --> 00:19:46,492
Your wife?

119
00:19:49,133 --> 00:19:52,102
- My wife.
- That was a stupid question.

120
00:19:55,806 --> 00:19:58,536
Your boy. He looks like you.

121
00:20:06,517 --> 00:20:08,519
You see? It is trying
to stall my liberty of paper.

122
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:11,155
They are trying to shut me down.
I am overwhelmed right now.

123
00:20:11,155 --> 00:20:15,392
I'm fighting just to keep
my paper open. I can't help you.

124
00:20:15,392 --> 00:20:16,727
- You don't mean that.

125
00:20:20,497 --> 00:20:22,700
- A fire, what?
- Fires happen all the time.

126
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,868
There's no fire department,
there's no fire trucks.

127
00:20:24,868 --> 00:20:27,564
What. Fire trucks?
There's no water.

128
00:20:30,874 --> 00:20:33,210
Diaz, listen to me.
We can get the front page.

129
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,879
Think about it.
They'd never do this to you again.

130
00:20:35,879 --> 00:20:40,150
What is this? More promises
of glory from George?

131
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,919
That's what you left me,
remember?

132
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,355
The answer is no.
Do you understand no? No!

133
00:20:50,461 --> 00:20:53,123
You're blowing it, Diaz!
Big time!

134
00:20:55,165 --> 00:20:56,600
What's going on over there?

135
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,127
That girl says that she was in hell
with the devil. And that she escaped.

136
00:22:08,639 --> 00:22:12,276
Ask her if she has any marks
maybe on her neck...

137
00:22:12,276 --> 00:22:15,268
or a bite mark on her breast.

138
00:22:38,869 --> 00:22:40,734
Do you know what this means?

139
00:22:41,505 --> 00:22:44,338
A lot of our victims had
that bite mark on their breasts.

140
00:22:45,676 --> 00:22:48,412
It all happened in Lotte Bravo.

141
00:22:48,412 --> 00:22:50,471
Almost all the killings
happened there.

142
00:22:51,081 --> 00:22:53,641
Has any other woman
ever survived an attack?

143
00:22:53,984 --> 00:22:55,508
No, never.

144
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,947
This could blow the whole lid over
what's happening here in Juarez.

145
00:23:08,365 --> 00:23:10,060
- No, senorita.
- No?

146
00:23:14,304 --> 00:23:16,440
Si. We'll help.

147
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:24,681
You hear that, right? We can't
let the police get to them.

148
00:23:24,681 --> 00:23:27,718
Don't worry. I don't have intentions
of giving them to the police.

149
00:23:27,718 --> 00:23:30,020
We've got to get them out of here,
through the back. Come on.

150
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,856
I'm gonna go with them. This could be
the biggest story of the year.

151
00:23:32,856 --> 00:23:37,661
She could never disappear in a crowd
with you, a blonde American?

152
00:23:37,661 --> 00:23:40,464
You're going to put her life
in danger for a fucking story?

153
00:23:40,464 --> 00:23:43,901
But her life is already in danger.
She wants our help. Didn't you hear?

154
00:23:43,901 --> 00:23:46,529
The police have assembled
a fort out there.

155
00:23:48,639 --> 00:23:52,632
- Over here.
- No, no.

156
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:55,435
That's the first place
they would look.

157
00:23:56,346 --> 00:23:57,574
Shit!

158
00:24:02,452 --> 00:24:03,544
Diaz!

159
00:24:10,594 --> 00:24:15,365
Mr. Lopez? I'm Lauren Adrian
from the Chicago Sentinel.

160
00:24:15,365 --> 00:24:19,102
- A woman reporter?
- We've been around since Lois Lane.

161
00:24:19,102 --> 00:24:21,127
I'm doing a story...

162
00:24:21,705 --> 00:24:25,709
I'm doing a story on the murders.
Of the factory workers?

163
00:24:25,709 --> 00:24:27,411
You did get my interview request?

164
00:24:27,411 --> 00:24:29,947
- You've heard of me in Chicago?
- Sure.

165
00:24:29,947 --> 00:24:34,518
- Can I get your picture for my piece?
- Yeah.

166
00:24:34,518 --> 00:24:35,886
- Is that okay?
- Sure.

167
00:24:35,886 --> 00:24:38,021
Why don't you guys get together?

168
00:24:38,021 --> 00:24:40,657
You know what?
Hold these papers...

169
00:24:40,657 --> 00:24:43,460
and act like you're having
an important conversation.

170
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,758
Perfect. That's it.

171
00:25:08,085 --> 00:25:10,713
- No. Sorry.
- Okay.

172
00:26:15,619 --> 00:26:17,120
You can't take him anywhere.

173
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,624
It's for questioning. Don't the police
question people in Chicago?

174
00:26:20,624 --> 00:26:23,218
Is all right.
I've been through this before.

175
00:26:26,596 --> 00:26:28,587
Call me for that interview.

176
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:43,712
You can come out.

177
00:26:53,523 --> 00:26:54,581
You okay?

178
00:27:02,132 --> 00:27:04,201
- Do you understand?
- Si. We understand.

179
00:27:04,201 --> 00:27:06,603
We work in El Paso.
A little English, we understand.

180
00:27:06,603 --> 00:27:11,768
Maybe with your little English and my
little Spanish we can get through this.

181
00:27:12,175 --> 00:27:15,303
She cannot go home.
They will take her.

182
00:27:17,881 --> 00:27:20,975
- You understand? She cannot go home.
- Yes. Yes.

183
00:27:23,687 --> 00:27:25,622
How about we do this?

184
00:27:25,622 --> 00:27:29,593
You tu casa.

185
00:27:29,593 --> 00:27:32,829
And I will take Eva with me.

186
00:27:32,829 --> 00:27:34,564
That's what we'll do.

187
00:27:34,564 --> 00:27:39,369
And if you need anything,
talk to Alfonso Diaz.

188
00:27:39,369 --> 00:27:41,838
We'll go out the back.
You'll out the front.

189
00:27:41,838 --> 00:27:44,170
Everything normal.
That's what we'll do.

190
00:28:03,393 --> 00:28:04,951
What's that?

191
00:28:14,671 --> 00:28:17,707
You like that?
You like the song?

192
00:28:23,313 --> 00:28:25,076
Look! There he is!

193
00:28:26,249 --> 00:28:29,116
- He's cute.
- Yes, he is.

194
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,441
George, listen to me.

195
00:28:51,441 --> 00:28:53,276
This girl was attacked,
strangled, buried...

196
00:28:53,276 --> 00:28:56,947
and left for dead. She crawled out
of her own fucking grave.

197
00:28:56,947 --> 00:29:00,083
Does anyone else know
about this, any other papers?

198
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:02,381
No. I'm sitting on an exclusive.

199
00:29:12,829 --> 00:29:15,065
I can't keep her here by myself.

200
00:29:15,065 --> 00:29:19,869
There's this woman, Teresa Casillas
And she's on my interview list.

201
00:29:19,869 --> 00:29:22,303
She started a group
for the woman workers.

202
00:29:29,713 --> 00:29:33,416
Get this. She wants to find
the guys who did this.

203
00:29:33,416 --> 00:29:34,918
And I'm going to help her.

204
00:29:34,918 --> 00:29:39,787
Well, it's a great angle, Lauren.
But be careful. You're not a cop.

205
00:29:48,732 --> 00:29:49,858
George, I gotta go!

206
00:29:50,834 --> 00:29:51,994
Eva?

207
00:30:02,078 --> 00:30:03,238
Eva!

208
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,757
Do you have my keys?

209
00:33:18,308 --> 00:33:21,573
- Shut up!

210
00:33:39,162 --> 00:33:40,459
Oh, shit.

211
00:34:22,005 --> 00:34:25,008
Hi, I'm Lauren Adrian,
journalist from the United States.

212
00:34:25,008 --> 00:34:27,277
I need to speak to Senora Casillas?

213
00:34:27,277 --> 00:34:28,745
She's busy now.

214
00:34:28,745 --> 00:34:30,346
It's an emergency.

215
00:34:30,346 --> 00:34:32,215
- Gracias.
- Si.

216
00:34:32,215 --> 00:34:33,383
Lauren Adrian?

217
00:34:33,383 --> 00:34:36,119
- You Teresa Casillas?
- I thought the interview was tomorrow.

218
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:39,289
Yeah, but I have a situation.

219
00:34:39,289 --> 00:34:42,058
I have a girl with me.
She was raped...

220
00:34:42,058 --> 00:34:43,660
and almost killed in the desert.

221
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:46,796
She's weak. She's in my car.
And I'm gonna need some help.

222
00:34:46,796 --> 00:34:48,127
Of course.

223
00:34:58,474 --> 00:35:00,305
This is dangerous.

224
00:35:00,677 --> 00:35:03,212
I don't think you know
how dangerous this is.

225
00:35:03,212 --> 00:35:07,784
The government here doesn't want
anyone to know about these things.

226
00:35:07,784 --> 00:35:11,554
If you go around
telling people about this...

227
00:35:11,554 --> 00:35:15,658
- then you become their enemy.
- But this is an important story.

228
00:35:15,658 --> 00:35:18,161
A story that I desperately
want to tell.

229
00:35:18,161 --> 00:35:22,165
Even if you find Eva's attackers...

230
00:35:22,165 --> 00:35:26,069
she will have to identify them
in a formal court proceedings...

231
00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:28,304
before she can have any trial.

232
00:35:28,304 --> 00:35:33,076
The court will not be on her side
and she would have no protection.

233
00:35:33,076 --> 00:35:36,739
She's going to be putting
her life in danger.

234
00:35:38,715 --> 00:35:41,445
Will she be able to do this?

235
00:35:43,686 --> 00:35:46,086
She crawled out of her own grave.

236
00:35:49,192 --> 00:35:51,490
She wants to do this, Teresa.

237
00:35:59,469 --> 00:36:01,061
There you are.

238
00:36:08,111 --> 00:36:09,339
It's real.

239
00:36:12,515 --> 00:36:16,419
She's gonna let you
stay here for awhile...

240
00:36:16,419 --> 00:36:19,183
so you don't have to go back
to the hotel or anything.

241
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:23,084
He came to me that last night
at the hotel.

242
00:36:26,562 --> 00:36:28,154
Who came to you?

243
00:36:32,602 --> 00:36:35,872
Eva, there was nobody
at the hotel last night.

244
00:36:35,872 --> 00:36:38,841
- He was.
- It wasn't real.

245
00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:48,482
There's a doctor here to see you.
He's going to help you get better.

246
00:36:49,252 --> 00:36:51,220
Are you going to fight for me?

247
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:56,155
Of course I'm going
to fight for you.

248
00:36:57,193 --> 00:37:00,219
Lauren? This is the doctor.

249
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:01,931
Lauren Adrian.

250
00:37:01,931 --> 00:37:03,399
- Mucho gusto.
- Mucho gusto.

251
00:37:03,399 --> 00:37:06,736
- This is Eva.
- Hola, Eva.

252
00:37:15,278 --> 00:37:17,280
- Lauren?
- Diaz. You all right?

253
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,882
I'm fine. The police
released me this morning.

254
00:37:19,882 --> 00:37:24,153
But the mothers, they found
another body in Lotte Bravo.

255
00:37:24,153 --> 00:37:26,189
- Really?
- You have to come. Quickly.

256
00:37:26,189 --> 00:37:27,884
I'm coming right now.

257
00:37:35,732 --> 00:37:37,461
No photographs!

258
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:40,397
- It's digital.
- Senor, senor.

259
00:37:43,906 --> 00:37:47,243
It's starting to feel like
old times.

260
00:37:47,243 --> 00:37:50,747
Did you see? She was strangled
with one of her shoelaces.

261
00:37:50,747 --> 00:37:52,305
It's one of the patterns.

262
00:37:52,815 --> 00:37:55,443
The Chief of Police right up there.

263
00:37:57,887 --> 00:38:00,823
'Scuse me. Hi, I'm Lauren Adrian
from the Chicago Sentinel.

264
00:38:00,823 --> 00:38:02,592
I don't have time
for any interviews.

265
00:38:02,592 --> 00:38:05,528
But doesn't this killing prove that
there are murderers in Juarez?

266
00:38:05,528 --> 00:38:09,832
This is not one of the murders.
It's a case of domestic violence.

267
00:38:09,832 --> 00:38:13,369
- Domestic violence?
- The murders are the work of one man.

268
00:38:13,369 --> 00:38:16,572
- His name is Al-Abar.
- Haven't there been many murders...

269
00:38:16,572 --> 00:38:18,808
- since he's been arrested?
- We have reason to believe...

270
00:38:18,808 --> 00:38:21,344
he has been masterminding
these murders from prison.

271
00:38:21,344 --> 00:38:23,679
I'd like an interview with him.
How can I get an interview?

272
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:25,281
That is totally impossible.

273
00:38:25,281 --> 00:38:28,718
- So no one's allowed to see him.
- Senorita...

274
00:38:28,718 --> 00:38:33,456
the man is in total isolation.
No one is allowed to see him.

275
00:38:33,456 --> 00:38:34,548
Really?

276
00:38:35,758 --> 00:38:38,625
Then how is he masterminding
all these killings from prison?

277
00:38:42,231 --> 00:38:44,791
We're still investigating that.

278
00:39:07,256 --> 00:39:12,319
So, that night you walked
right through here.

279
00:39:14,497 --> 00:39:18,868
On the street.
And then I...

280
00:39:18,868 --> 00:39:22,599
I turned down this alley.

281
00:39:25,975 --> 00:39:30,046
This is the way I always
take to home. Mi casa.

282
00:39:30,046 --> 00:39:33,379
And this is where the man
who frightened you came up to you.

283
00:39:34,517 --> 00:39:36,246
And then you...

284
00:39:39,322 --> 00:39:41,390
- I went that way.
- Down this way...

285
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:43,790
and that's where you got
on the factory bus.

286
00:39:45,461 --> 00:39:49,363
Well, we're early.
Let's wait.

287
00:39:49,899 --> 00:39:54,563
And when a factory bus comes by,
that'll be our bus.

288
00:40:03,412 --> 00:40:04,572
It's hot.

289
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:17,016
- You miss your home?
- Mucho.

290
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,391
Why don't you tell me about it?

291
00:40:22,498 --> 00:40:25,092
I came from Oaxaca.

292
00:40:25,635 --> 00:40:27,569
I love my land.

293
00:40:39,115 --> 00:40:41,379
But they took the land away.

294
00:40:42,151 --> 00:40:44,881
- Who took the land away?

295
00:40:45,955 --> 00:40:48,116
We cannot pay the taxes, so...

296
00:40:48,457 --> 00:40:53,895
they tell us, go to the border
and work in the maquiladoras.

297
00:40:55,064 --> 00:40:57,760
Make money to keep your land.

298
00:40:59,902 --> 00:41:01,893
But there is no money here.

299
00:41:03,572 --> 00:41:07,474
The government and the factories
take everything.

300
00:41:08,377 --> 00:41:10,368
All the money is for them.

301
00:41:11,781 --> 00:41:15,148
For us, nothing.

302
00:41:28,464 --> 00:41:30,432
But what can we do?

303
00:41:32,601 --> 00:41:37,561
We have no land.
We cannot go home.

304
00:41:38,908 --> 00:41:40,136
Nothing.

305
00:41:42,578 --> 00:41:43,909
I'm sorry.

306
00:41:47,116 --> 00:41:48,606
It's very sad.

307
00:41:54,523 --> 00:41:56,047
But tell me about you.

308
00:41:56,492 --> 00:41:58,894
- About me?
- Yeah.

309
00:41:58,894 --> 00:42:02,386
I tell you about me,
now you tell me about you.

310
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:04,793
All right.

311
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:12,742
I don't have any children.
I'm not married.

312
00:42:12,742 --> 00:42:14,972
- No children?
- No.

313
00:42:19,682 --> 00:42:24,051
- 'Cause I work.
- My mother work and she has children.

314
00:42:24,887 --> 00:42:28,691
I have a different kind of work.
It's called a career.

315
00:42:31,761 --> 00:42:35,060
A career. Okay.

316
00:42:35,898 --> 00:42:41,237
A career is a kind of work
that you want more than anything...

317
00:42:41,237 --> 00:42:44,173
and you give up
everything to get it.

318
00:42:44,173 --> 00:42:47,199
And when you get it...

319
00:42:49,145 --> 00:42:53,514
you realize that it's not that great
and you have no life.

320
00:42:59,522 --> 00:43:01,649
That makes two of us.

321
00:43:03,692 --> 00:43:05,990
- Okay.

322
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:08,597
I got it.

323
00:43:22,545 --> 00:43:23,739
Oh, my God.

324
00:43:24,747 --> 00:43:26,510
Oh, God.

325
00:43:27,316 --> 00:43:30,717
It's the end of a shift.
There's gonna be a lot of buses.

326
00:43:31,654 --> 00:43:35,524
Maybe we'll be able to identify
the buses by their numbers.

327
00:43:35,524 --> 00:43:40,196
Then I'll follow the buses,
take photographs of the drivers.

328
00:43:40,196 --> 00:43:44,565
You can identify them and then,
and then we'll have our man.

329
00:43:56,679 --> 00:43:58,579
Ready? Now!

330
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:03,652
- That's it!
- You get it?

331
00:44:03,652 --> 00:44:04,619
I got it.

332
00:44:11,927 --> 00:44:14,327
Go, go. You got him.

333
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,608
Let's go. Come on.

334
00:44:29,145 --> 00:44:31,238
- So.
- Just walk.

335
00:44:44,693 --> 00:44:49,357
You think we could go around
the other side and get some more?

336
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,828
Oh, shit. Come on!

337
00:45:02,211 --> 00:45:04,645
Come on. Come on!

338
00:45:16,792 --> 00:45:18,259
Stay here!

339
00:45:28,871 --> 00:45:31,396
Come here, come here!
Run!

340
00:45:37,213 --> 00:45:39,647
Down!

341
00:45:58,033 --> 00:45:59,768
- Teresa!
- Yes?

342
00:45:59,768 --> 00:46:01,429
- Come here, please.
- Yes.

343
00:46:02,204 --> 00:46:05,074
- Lauren'll stay with you tonight.
- What happened?

344
00:46:05,074 --> 00:46:08,210
- She can't go back to her hotel.
- Not tonight.

345
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:10,479
I have a party tonight.

346
00:46:10,479 --> 00:46:13,349
At the Salamanca house.
I have to go.

347
00:46:13,349 --> 00:46:15,784
Can you cancel it?
Hold on.

348
00:46:15,784 --> 00:46:18,354
Don't.
Take Lauren with you.

349
00:46:18,354 --> 00:46:22,191
No one will know she's there.
I'll get these guys off her trail.

350
00:46:22,191 --> 00:46:24,125
Excuse me a second.

351
00:46:25,828 --> 00:46:28,998
Laurie, please, do as I say.
Promise me.

352
00:46:28,998 --> 00:46:31,867
- Are you gonna be safe?
- I can take care of myself.

353
00:46:31,867 --> 00:46:34,165
Give me your hotel key.
I'll get your things.

354
00:46:36,171 --> 00:46:38,036
- I'll see you later. Bye.
- Okay.

355
00:46:40,743 --> 00:46:44,770
I hope you realize how much he's
jeopardizing his own life for you.

356
00:46:45,047 --> 00:46:46,344
Yeah, I know.

357
00:46:48,317 --> 00:46:51,053
- Is Eva here?
- Yes. She's inside.

358
00:46:51,053 --> 00:46:52,788
We should take her with us
tonight, too, don't you think?

359
00:46:52,788 --> 00:46:55,157
- No. We can't.
- Why?

360
00:46:55,157 --> 00:46:57,793
It's gonna be bad for her.

361
00:46:57,793 --> 00:46:59,028
- No.
- Why?

362
00:46:59,028 --> 00:47:02,998
You don't understand.
These people are rich and...

363
00:47:02,998 --> 00:47:06,802
- she's gonna feel so uncomfortable.
- Somebody just tried to kill us.

364
00:47:06,802 --> 00:47:08,963
I'm not leaving Eva alone tonight.

365
00:47:10,406 --> 00:47:12,374
We can't leave her alone, okay?

366
00:47:31,994 --> 00:47:35,264
Relax.
You look beautiful.

367
00:47:35,264 --> 00:47:40,497
- Doesn't she look beautiful?
- You look so beautiful. You do.

368
00:47:50,212 --> 00:47:53,782
Is that Senator Rawlings?
What is he doing here?

369
00:47:53,782 --> 00:47:58,220
Celebrating the 15th birthday
of Don Philippe Salamanca's daughter.

370
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:01,156
And so is the governor,
the archbishop...

371
00:48:01,156 --> 00:48:04,960
and the heads of some American
and Japanese companies.

372
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,896
Really? Who is
the Salamanca family?

373
00:48:07,896 --> 00:48:11,266
Let's just say that the Free Trade
Agreement couldn't happen...

374
00:48:11,266 --> 00:48:14,429
without the support
of the Salamanca family.

375
00:48:17,172 --> 00:48:18,469
Excuse me.

376
00:48:22,277 --> 00:48:25,769
- This whole party is for her?
- Yeah.

377
00:48:27,349 --> 00:48:28,941
She's lucky.

378
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:32,852
Yeah.

379
00:48:33,822 --> 00:48:35,289
She's lucky.

380
00:48:38,494 --> 00:48:39,893
Perfect.

381
00:48:52,908 --> 00:48:54,843
- What happened?
- It's Juanes!

382
00:48:54,843 --> 00:48:57,073
Oh, my God.

383
00:49:07,623 --> 00:49:09,057
- Why don't you go up there?
- No.

384
00:49:09,057 --> 00:49:10,926
- Yes, get close.
- No.

385
00:49:10,926 --> 00:49:13,429
- Eva, go meet him.
- No...

386
00:49:13,429 --> 00:49:15,264
- I'm gonna take her up there.
- No!

387
00:49:15,264 --> 00:49:17,061
Yes.

388
00:49:55,003 --> 00:49:57,995
Particularly extravagant for a girl's
15th birthday, don't you think?

389
00:49:59,174 --> 00:50:02,234
I don't know. The chance
to catch Juanes' sweaty vest...

390
00:50:02,344 --> 00:50:04,904
can only come once in a girl's life.

391
00:50:05,547 --> 00:50:08,984
Please allow me to introduce myself.
Marco Antonio Salamanca.

392
00:50:08,984 --> 00:50:11,954
- People call me just Marco.
- I'm Lauren Adrian.

393
00:50:11,954 --> 00:50:14,422
I'm a friend of Teresa Casias'.

394
00:50:15,157 --> 00:50:18,060
Thank you for allowing us
into your lovely home, Marco.

395
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:20,496
- You're American.
- Yes.

396
00:50:20,496 --> 00:50:23,431
- You new to Juarez?
- Yes.

397
00:50:25,267 --> 00:50:26,393
Listen.

398
00:50:27,035 --> 00:50:31,139
I'd love to show you
a sight of Juarez...

399
00:50:31,139 --> 00:50:33,573
that I'm sure you've
never experienced.

400
00:50:34,076 --> 00:50:36,378
So, now I'm seeing a sight
I like right now.

401
00:50:36,378 --> 00:50:40,048
But there is another sight...

402
00:50:40,048 --> 00:50:44,386
that is more exciting
and mysterious.

403
00:50:44,386 --> 00:50:46,622
- Sounds dangerous.
- No, no.

404
00:50:46,622 --> 00:50:50,353
Just incredibly thrilling.

405
00:50:53,028 --> 00:50:57,328
Well, if I ever have
the urge for a tour, Marco...

406
00:50:58,133 --> 00:51:00,465
I know I can find you.

407
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:25,016
- What's your name?
- Eva.

408
00:51:56,358 --> 00:51:59,054
- Something's wrong.
- What?

409
00:51:59,561 --> 00:52:01,290
Hey, you okay?

410
00:52:07,736 --> 00:52:11,695
Let's get her out of here. Teresa.
Let's get her back to your house.

411
00:52:15,043 --> 00:52:16,244
No!

412
00:52:16,244 --> 00:52:20,647
You're safe! Eva?

413
00:52:27,122 --> 00:52:29,613
Eva? Eva.

414
00:52:30,425 --> 00:52:32,120
It's me.

415
00:52:33,795 --> 00:52:36,059
No. Baby. Baby.

416
00:53:47,469 --> 00:53:51,773
How's she doing today?
Is she feeling better?

417
00:53:51,773 --> 00:53:56,870
She's not well.
I had to call back that doctor.

418
00:53:58,146 --> 00:54:00,782
- What are these, pictures?
- Yes.

419
00:54:00,782 --> 00:54:05,754
Lauren, I don't think
you want to torment her.

420
00:54:05,754 --> 00:54:08,290
I wouldn't do that.
She wants to find these men.

421
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:10,892
And after I saw the second killer,
her life is in danger.

422
00:54:10,892 --> 00:54:13,361
- We didn't see any killer.
- Yes, we did!

423
00:54:13,361 --> 00:54:18,266
You didn't see any killer
because there is no second killer.

424
00:54:18,266 --> 00:54:21,837
- What are you talking about?
- The psychologists are convinced...

425
00:54:21,837 --> 00:54:24,940
that Eva imagined
the second killer.

426
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:27,976
I don't care what the doctors say.
I was there. I saw it.

427
00:54:27,976 --> 00:54:31,246
She comes from an Indian culture.
Her people...

428
00:54:31,246 --> 00:54:35,984
often don't distinguish real things
from the things they imagine.

429
00:54:35,984 --> 00:54:38,787
- Are you saying she's crazy?
- No! She's not crazy.

430
00:54:38,787 --> 00:54:44,623
She believes what she says.
But this doesn't mean that it's true.

431
00:54:46,228 --> 00:54:48,730
I saw the look on that man's face.

432
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:50,665
- He recognized her.
- No, please.

433
00:54:50,665 --> 00:54:52,634
- That is the man...
- Don't!

434
00:54:52,634 --> 00:54:55,871
Don't. This is my house and this
stops here. I can't deal with this.

435
00:54:55,871 --> 00:54:58,340
- You wanted this story, too.
- No!

436
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:01,309
Your story is destroying her.

437
00:55:01,309 --> 00:55:04,312
And, God, Lauren.
You can be killed too.

438
00:55:04,312 --> 00:55:08,271
You understand that? They tried it
before and they will kill you.

439
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,717
I cannot do this anymore.
Please, just leave.

440
00:55:20,662 --> 00:55:25,190
- I'm sorry. Did we wake you up?

441
00:55:26,334 --> 00:55:28,802
- It's not important right now.
- It is important.

442
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:35,367
- Eva.
- No, Teresa.

443
00:55:48,657 --> 00:55:54,254
And we are gonna find them
together. Right?

444
00:56:42,377 --> 00:56:45,369
This is the road
where Eva was raped.

445
00:56:45,714 --> 00:56:50,418
This is where I want you to be.
You and the police.

446
00:56:50,418 --> 00:56:54,286
Eva identified the bus driver.
His name is Domingo Esparza.

447
00:56:54,556 --> 00:56:57,889
They drive the victims out here
and then meet the other attacker.

448
00:56:59,094 --> 00:57:03,431
I'll go undercover into the factory
he worked for and pose as a worker.

449
00:57:03,431 --> 00:57:06,401
If we know who this Esparza is,
just have him arrested.

450
00:57:06,401 --> 00:57:09,337
If we have him arrested, we have
no chance of catching the second guy.

451
00:57:09,337 --> 00:57:12,329
He's already seen Eva.
He'll come after her.

452
00:57:12,841 --> 00:57:16,344
I'm going into the factory as bait.
It's our only chance to catch both.

453
00:57:16,344 --> 00:57:20,682
You can't. We have to warn too many
people. The police'll never allow it.

454
00:57:20,682 --> 00:57:24,920
That's why you'll only tell them
after I'm in there already.

455
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:27,489
They're not gonna risk having
an American journalist killed.

456
00:57:27,489 --> 00:57:31,393
There must be people
on the police that you trust.

457
00:57:31,393 --> 00:57:34,462
- People who care about the truth.
- Yeah, I know people.

458
00:57:34,462 --> 00:57:37,465
I think I can trust them.
But you never really know.

459
00:57:37,465 --> 00:57:41,503
People get bribed. I'm not going
to gamble with your life.

460
00:57:41,503 --> 00:57:45,173
I'm not gonna gamble with Eva's life.
It's now or never. Don't you see?

461
00:57:45,173 --> 00:57:47,475
No, I don't see.
This is out of the question.

462
00:57:47,475 --> 00:57:50,712
- Diaz, listen to me.
- I won't listen to you.

463
00:57:50,712 --> 00:57:55,376
I won't let you. If anything happened
to you, I'll never forgive myself!

464
00:58:07,429 --> 00:58:08,691
I can't do this.

465
00:58:24,713 --> 00:58:25,839
All right.

466
00:58:26,848 --> 00:58:29,484
You are not going into the factory.

467
00:58:29,484 --> 00:58:32,220
And we will find another way
to hunt around this. Get in the car.

468
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,415
It's not your choice to make.

469
00:58:36,725 --> 00:58:40,058
I promised Eva that I'd help her
find these men.

470
00:58:41,463 --> 00:58:43,488
And I pray that you'll help me.

471
00:58:45,133 --> 00:58:49,968
But even if you don't, I'm going
into that factory tomorrow.

472
00:59:26,141 --> 00:59:28,701
Come in, come in.

473
00:59:39,087 --> 00:59:40,520
How do I look?

474
00:59:44,926 --> 00:59:49,260
- With just this.
- Okay.

475
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,496
- Like that?
- Something like that.

476
00:59:59,007 --> 01:00:00,565
You look pretty.

477
01:00:01,876 --> 01:00:03,138
For good luck.

478
01:00:08,516 --> 01:00:10,074
Now you look like me.

479
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:18,491
I want to give you something.

480
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:22,864
- No, it's okay.
- Yes. Yes. No.

481
01:00:22,864 --> 01:00:27,927
She protect me that night.

482
01:00:29,037 --> 01:00:31,232
Now she's gonna protect you.

483
01:00:33,141 --> 01:00:34,631
Let me.

484
01:00:35,677 --> 01:00:36,871
Okay.

485
01:00:46,588 --> 01:00:48,317
You are safe now.

486
01:00:53,995 --> 01:00:56,190
- Hi. Lauren.
- Eva.

487
01:01:00,802 --> 01:01:02,270
It's too dangerous.

488
01:01:02,270 --> 01:01:04,738
I'll be fine.

489
01:01:11,613 --> 01:01:13,080
Good luck, Lauren.

490
01:03:01,856 --> 01:03:03,915
Please leave quickly.

491
01:03:03,992 --> 01:03:06,722
The next shift starts
in 10 minutes.

492
01:06:12,046 --> 01:06:15,573
Don't be afraid.
I won't hurt you.

493
01:08:46,467 --> 01:08:47,695
You all right?

494
01:08:50,304 --> 01:08:52,067
A mass grave.

495
01:08:53,541 --> 01:08:55,509
It was a mass grave.

496
01:09:00,748 --> 01:09:03,012
We didn't find the other attacker.

497
01:09:04,185 --> 01:09:05,618
There was nobody there.

498
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:08,656
Well, he was there.
He's out there.

499
01:09:08,656 --> 01:09:11,124
I'm telling you, he was here.

500
01:09:13,661 --> 01:09:15,696
He can see us.
I can feel it.

501
01:09:15,696 --> 01:09:18,221
This isn't over until I find him.

502
01:09:23,604 --> 01:09:25,629
When I was on that bus...

503
01:09:27,208 --> 01:09:29,676
everything was just as Eva told it.

504
01:09:32,213 --> 01:09:34,773
It made me feel like
I was living her story.

505
01:10:01,542 --> 01:10:04,712
"The screams of the women
of Juarez are silent...

506
01:10:04,712 --> 01:10:06,475
because no one will listen...

507
01:10:07,181 --> 01:10:11,584
not the corporations who make
their profits from their labor.

508
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:16,524
Not the governments of Mexico
and the United States...

509
01:10:16,524 --> 01:10:19,288
who benefit
from the free trade agreements.

510
01:10:20,461 --> 01:10:22,122
No one will listen.

511
01:10:23,230 --> 01:10:26,563
All the evidence points to the fact
that there are many killers.

512
01:10:27,501 --> 01:10:29,837
A whole culture of murder
that just gets worse and worse...

513
01:10:29,837 --> 01:10:32,704
the more it's denied
and covered up.

514
01:10:34,175 --> 01:10:38,168
Covering it up is less expensive
than protecting these women.

515
01:10:38,913 --> 01:10:41,347
Money is
about the bottom line.

516
01:10:42,149 --> 01:10:44,617
And so the death toll mounts.

517
01:10:45,519 --> 01:10:49,523
Eva Jimenez, 16 years old.

518
01:10:49,523 --> 01:10:53,687
She works in a factory
assembling televisions.

519
01:10:54,295 --> 01:10:56,597
She makes five dollars a day."

520
01:10:56,597 --> 01:11:00,167
- I finished your story.
- Yeah? You finished my story.

521
01:11:00,167 --> 01:11:03,659
Tomorrow it'll be printed
and everybody will know about it.

522
01:11:04,638 --> 01:11:07,374
Don't forget that in five days
you're gonna have to go to court.

523
01:11:07,374 --> 01:11:08,909
- I know.
- You'll have to talk to a judge...

524
01:11:08,909 --> 01:11:12,675
and you'll have
to tell him everything.

525
01:11:13,447 --> 01:11:16,746
- Can you do this?
- I think I can.

526
01:11:23,691 --> 01:11:28,890
The man we saw at the party,
we didn't catch him.

527
01:11:29,964 --> 01:11:32,366
- What?
- I know. It's gonna be okay.

528
01:11:32,366 --> 01:11:37,271
No, you don't.
He is the Devil. The Devil.

529
01:11:37,271 --> 01:11:41,208
He'll take me to Hell.
He don't want me to go to the judge.

530
01:11:41,208 --> 01:11:43,778
Eva, please.

531
01:11:43,778 --> 01:11:45,473
You'll be safe.

532
01:11:46,313 --> 01:11:47,681
You have to believe me.

533
01:11:47,681 --> 01:11:50,017
I will not let anything
happen to you.

534
01:11:50,017 --> 01:11:52,353
And I will find this man.

535
01:11:52,353 --> 01:11:55,254
You're gonna be okay.
I know how to find him.

536
01:12:55,316 --> 01:12:57,716
- Just leave the glass there?
- Just leave the glass there.

537
01:12:58,085 --> 01:13:01,956
- Here comes the magic.
- All right.

538
01:13:01,956 --> 01:13:05,756
- You gonna show me something?
- Now it's gonna disappear.

539
01:13:11,332 --> 01:13:14,358
It took me two semesters at Harvard
to learn that trick.

540
01:13:18,439 --> 01:13:20,841
I learned that first week
at St. Mary's High.

541
01:13:20,841 --> 01:13:24,345
- I was always a poor student.
- Don't worry. I give tutorials.

542
01:13:24,345 --> 01:13:26,006
- Oh, you do?
- Yeah.

543
01:13:27,648 --> 01:13:31,318
What was it like being a Mexican at
Harvard? They had two of you there?

544
01:13:31,318 --> 01:13:34,310
But I'm an American citizen.

545
01:13:34,688 --> 01:13:37,791
It's convenient. I can be Mexican
whenever I want to or American.

546
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:40,461
- So, deep down you're just a gringo.
- Well, of course.

547
01:13:40,461 --> 01:13:43,294
It's the best thing to be.
The whole world wants to be gringo.

548
01:13:43,797 --> 01:13:46,467
Come to think of it, there were a lot
of gringos at your party that night.

549
01:13:46,467 --> 01:13:48,636
- I even saw Senator...
- Rawlings.

550
01:13:48,636 --> 01:13:50,137
- Right.
- You know...

551
01:13:50,137 --> 01:13:53,474
my family owns most of the land.

552
01:13:53,474 --> 01:13:56,510
So, he's given us a great
opportunity with NAFTA.

553
01:13:56,510 --> 01:13:59,680
There was somebody else there, too.

554
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:05,119
So he was tall. He was kind
of dark eyes. Gold teeth?

555
01:14:05,119 --> 01:14:08,889
- Why do you wanna know?
- No reason. It was just...

556
01:14:08,889 --> 01:14:14,662
something that Teresa had said.
He had a scar right here.

557
01:14:14,662 --> 01:14:18,120
Aris. Aris Rodriguez.

558
01:14:18,766 --> 01:14:21,368
His family's involved
with the NAFTA factories.

559
01:14:21,368 --> 01:14:22,892
A very old family, too.

560
01:14:25,406 --> 01:14:26,873
Who's calling me?

561
01:14:29,643 --> 01:14:30,871
George!

562
01:14:31,512 --> 01:14:36,006
Hey can you give a minute?
Hold on. I'm in a restaurant.

563
01:14:37,818 --> 01:14:39,687
So, did you read the piece?
What'd you think?

564
01:14:39,687 --> 01:14:44,391
Best think you've ever done.
It's got something I've never seen.

565
01:14:44,391 --> 01:14:46,460
Some incredible humanity.

566
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:49,463
And this portrait of Eva?
Quite beautiful.

567
01:14:49,463 --> 01:14:53,058
I don't know what to say.
You're my inspiration, George.

568
01:14:54,134 --> 01:14:56,003
It means the world to me
that you liked it.

569
01:14:56,003 --> 01:14:59,063
Frankly, I couldn't have done
a better job myself.

570
01:14:59,573 --> 01:15:01,507
Congratulations.

571
01:15:16,523 --> 01:15:18,559
Diaz, I just got off the phone
with Chicago. They loved the story.

572
01:15:18,559 --> 01:15:21,528
You want my husband.

573
01:15:22,563 --> 01:15:26,431
- Alfonso, telephone.

574
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:43,261
- Hey, George.
- No. This is Frank.

575
01:17:46,907 --> 01:17:50,611
I'm not supposed to tell you this,
but George didn't print the story.

576
01:17:50,611 --> 01:17:53,780
He got a visit from some political
types, including Senator Rawlings.

577
01:17:53,780 --> 01:17:55,883
After that, it was a no go.

578
01:17:55,883 --> 01:17:58,185
They're not printing it at all?

579
01:17:58,185 --> 01:18:02,189
You don't understand. Rawlings is
pushing a bill through Congress...

580
01:18:02,189 --> 01:18:05,092
to expand the Free Trade agreements
to include Central America...

581
01:18:05,092 --> 01:18:08,061
and they don't want
any bad press right now.

582
01:18:08,362 --> 01:18:11,064
- You dug too deep.
- Okay.

583
01:18:11,064 --> 01:18:15,669
- Your story is too fuckin' hot.
- Do me a favor.

584
01:18:15,669 --> 01:18:19,606
- Put me on the phone with George.
- He's not gonna talk to you.

585
01:18:19,606 --> 01:18:22,643
They're gonna say it's temporary
and for you to stay put.

586
01:18:22,643 --> 01:18:24,745
But that's just a smoke screen
to kill it.

587
01:18:24,745 --> 01:18:27,714
If you want the story printed,
you've gotta get back here.

588
01:18:27,714 --> 01:18:30,817
- Why are you doing this?
- 'Cause it's a great story.

589
01:18:30,817 --> 01:18:34,116
It needs to be printed.
It's now or never.

590
01:19:06,787 --> 01:19:10,416
So, Eva, I have something
to tell you. Your story...

591
01:19:17,664 --> 01:19:20,100
What do you mean?
They don't want my story?

592
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:22,864
No, they will want it.

593
01:19:31,044 --> 01:19:33,313
I have to talk to the judge
in three days.

594
01:19:33,313 --> 01:19:37,351
- I know.
- The murderer'll be there.

595
01:19:37,351 --> 01:19:40,752
- Don't worry.

596
01:19:51,231 --> 01:19:54,067
People promise many things,
but that never happens.

597
01:19:54,067 --> 01:19:56,136
I will get your story printed
and I won't stop...

598
01:19:56,136 --> 01:19:58,739
until both of your attackers
are punished.

599
01:19:58,739 --> 01:20:00,468
And I will be back.

600
01:20:00,741 --> 01:20:02,072
Eva, look at me.

601
01:20:48,088 --> 01:20:49,783
Teresa!

602
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:57,986
Teresa! Teresa!

603
01:22:14,508 --> 01:22:18,239
Miss, you can...
Lauren, is that you? Wait a minute!

604
01:22:21,314 --> 01:22:24,909
- Could you just...
- Lauren, come in.

605
01:22:25,419 --> 01:22:27,888
Lauren Adrian,
this is Samuel Denton...

606
01:22:27,888 --> 01:22:31,525
the C.E.O. Of the publishing
syndicate that owns the Sentinel.

607
01:22:31,525 --> 01:22:34,528
- This is Senator...
- Rawlings, I know.

608
01:22:34,528 --> 01:22:36,963
Saw you in Juarez last week
at the Salamanca house.

609
01:22:36,963 --> 01:22:40,934
- What were you doing there?
- Hi. I'm Denise McKenzie.

610
01:22:40,934 --> 01:22:42,969
I'm head
of all syndicate operations.

611
01:22:42,969 --> 01:22:46,940
Congratulations. You're gonna make
an exceptional foreign correspondent.

612
01:22:46,940 --> 01:22:49,067
We are all very excited.

613
01:22:49,543 --> 01:22:54,915
We're gonna have to let you go, or
else we're not gonna make our lunch.

614
01:22:54,915 --> 01:22:56,550
- I'll talk to you later.
- All the best.

615
01:22:56,550 --> 01:22:58,415
- Good to see you.
- Yeah.

616
01:23:03,690 --> 01:23:06,386
- Foreign correspondent?
- How about that?

617
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:10,191
- It's unbelievable.
- Your first assignment.

618
01:23:17,304 --> 01:23:19,940
- This is a bribe, isn't it?
- What do you care?

619
01:23:19,940 --> 01:23:22,108
You'd do anything for this job.
Consider it a freebie.

620
01:23:22,108 --> 01:23:26,046
This can't be you.
You can't bow to those people!

621
01:23:26,046 --> 01:23:28,281
- I'm not bowing to anyone.
- Then print my story.

622
01:23:28,281 --> 01:23:30,617
We cannot print your story.

623
01:23:30,617 --> 01:23:32,986
In three days,
a 16-year-old girl...

624
01:23:32,986 --> 01:23:35,555
is going into court to face
the man who tried to kill her!

625
01:23:35,555 --> 01:23:38,558
All because we said
that we would print her story.

626
01:23:38,558 --> 01:23:42,596
This story could save her life and
the lives of many women in Juarez.

627
01:23:42,596 --> 01:23:44,431
This is a fucking important story!

628
01:23:44,431 --> 01:23:46,533
I understand that.
But you are blaming...

629
01:23:46,533 --> 01:23:48,969
- the Mexican and American governments.
- You're god damned right I am.

630
01:23:48,969 --> 01:23:52,038
- And the Free Trade Agreement.
- It isn't free trade!

631
01:23:52,038 --> 01:23:56,076
It's slave trade. It's a scam.
Everybody is making too much money...

632
01:23:56,076 --> 01:23:58,178
- to give a shit about these women.
- Listen to me.

633
01:23:58,178 --> 01:24:02,048
These are very serious accusations,
they're damn near criminal.

634
01:24:02,048 --> 01:24:03,984
And this newspaper is not
prepared to make 'em...

635
01:24:03,984 --> 01:24:05,952
- and you can't substantiate them.
- And they're true!

636
01:24:05,952 --> 01:24:08,455
This is now a matter
of corporate responsibility.

637
01:24:08,455 --> 01:24:11,525
Since when do you put corporate
responsibility above the truth?

638
01:24:11,525 --> 01:24:15,328
Get off your soapbox. I liked you
better as a cutthroat reporter.

639
01:24:15,328 --> 01:24:18,632
I like you better as an editor who
couldn't be bought or intimidated!

640
01:24:18,632 --> 01:24:20,700
- A man I admire.
- The days of investigative reporting...

641
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:22,636
are over, Lauren.

642
01:24:22,636 --> 01:24:26,540
The news isn't news anymore. It's
as dead as the typewriter I used!

643
01:24:26,540 --> 01:24:29,075
Corporate America
is running the show now.

644
01:24:29,075 --> 01:24:33,246
And their news agenda is free trade,
globalization and entertainment.

645
01:24:33,246 --> 01:24:36,079
That's our glorious future!

646
01:24:36,750 --> 01:24:39,586
You know what would happen to me
if I published your story on my own.

647
01:24:39,586 --> 01:24:41,488
If you don't have the balls
to print my story...

648
01:24:41,488 --> 01:24:44,514
- I will find someone who will.
- It's not that easy, kid.

649
01:24:45,725 --> 01:24:47,317
Read your contract.

650
01:24:48,228 --> 01:24:51,664
The Sentinel owns your story.
Hell, it owns you.

651
01:24:54,668 --> 01:24:56,602
Nobody owns me!

652
01:24:58,038 --> 01:25:00,302
That's the difference
between me and you.

653
01:25:01,608 --> 01:25:02,973
Lauren!

654
01:25:24,831 --> 01:25:26,696
Take the job, Lauren.

655
01:25:27,100 --> 01:25:29,536
You got a damn fine career
in front of yourself...

656
01:25:29,536 --> 01:25:31,438
and you're throwing it all away
and for what?

657
01:25:31,438 --> 01:25:34,498
Your story about these women
is just not worth it.

658
01:25:35,375 --> 01:25:37,110
Not worth it?

659
01:25:37,110 --> 01:25:39,145
I forgot. They're just Mexican women
so they're not worth it.

660
01:25:39,145 --> 01:25:41,045
I didn't mean it that way.

661
01:25:42,349 --> 01:25:44,044
Do you see this?

662
01:25:45,185 --> 01:25:46,516
And this?

663
01:25:48,121 --> 01:25:52,148
And this? And this? And this?

664
01:25:53,426 --> 01:25:57,564
All of it is assembled in Juarez
and it's all covered with blood.

665
01:25:57,564 --> 01:25:59,866
Would you calm down?
If you walk out of here today...

666
01:25:59,866 --> 01:26:01,868
you could never get back in here,
and you know it.

667
01:26:01,868 --> 01:26:04,537
- For God's sakes, let this thing go!
- I can't.

668
01:26:04,537 --> 01:26:06,473
- You think this is your big story.
- My parents are from Mexico.

669
01:26:06,473 --> 01:26:11,069
- You identify with it.
- I'm one of them. Can't you see?

670
01:26:14,681 --> 01:26:18,173
My parents came here
as migrant farm workers.

671
01:26:20,286 --> 01:26:22,083
They were killed...

672
01:26:24,157 --> 01:26:25,749
so I was adopted.

673
01:26:33,099 --> 01:26:36,796
I only have vague
memories of them.

674
01:26:39,105 --> 01:26:43,804
I remember a field
filled with workers...

675
01:26:46,613 --> 01:26:48,080
My mother.

676
01:26:49,616 --> 01:26:51,140
My father.

677
01:26:56,456 --> 01:26:58,583
I was there when he was killed.

678
01:27:04,264 --> 01:27:06,198
I saw him die.

679
01:27:08,234 --> 01:27:12,205
- I'm sorry.
- When I met Eva, I saw myself.

680
01:27:12,205 --> 01:27:18,269
I've been running away
from who I am my whole life.

681
01:27:20,447 --> 01:27:23,712
Because you don't wanna be Mexican,
not in this country.

682
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:28,253
You see?

683
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:36,393
I could be one of the women
in those factories.

684
01:27:40,467 --> 01:27:42,935
It could be me
in one of those graves.

685
01:27:49,209 --> 01:27:51,200
I can't let this go.

686
01:28:56,376 --> 01:29:00,369
Alfonso!

687
01:29:56,436 --> 01:29:58,301
Can I speak to Diaz?

688
01:29:59,072 --> 01:30:00,403
What?

689
01:31:32,131 --> 01:31:33,359
What?

690
01:32:06,599 --> 01:32:11,434
- Who did this?
- I don't know. Nobody does.

691
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:13,773
Diaz is gone.

692
01:32:13,773 --> 01:32:17,577
And tomorrow the bus driver's
gonna be a free man.

693
01:32:17,577 --> 01:32:21,714
No! With Eva's testimony,
he will go to jail.

694
01:32:21,714 --> 01:32:24,250
- Eva's gone.
- What?

695
01:32:24,250 --> 01:32:29,188
She ran away. Nobody knows
where she is, not even her mother.

696
01:32:29,188 --> 01:32:32,492
Her mother. To move away
from Colonia Anapra.

697
01:32:32,492 --> 01:32:36,996
She want to be there for her,
waiting for her at their home...

698
01:32:36,996 --> 01:32:40,566
but she doesn't feel safe
there anymore.

699
01:32:40,566 --> 01:32:43,002
How could she? Tomorrow...

700
01:32:43,002 --> 01:32:45,903
Domingo Esparza
is gonna be a free man.

701
01:32:47,273 --> 01:32:50,709
- This isn't happening.
- It is happening.

702
01:32:51,544 --> 01:32:52,841
It's all over.

703
01:33:35,388 --> 01:33:36,286
Kids, get up.

704
01:33:38,591 --> 01:33:41,492
Oh, jeez. Poor people.

705
01:34:12,225 --> 01:34:14,216
- Lauren.
- Who are you?

706
01:34:15,561 --> 01:34:17,997
Would you gentlemen please
excuse us for a moment?

707
01:34:17,997 --> 01:34:19,799
Do you believe in anything?

708
01:34:19,799 --> 01:34:22,702
Are you, Mexican? American?
What are you?

709
01:34:22,702 --> 01:34:27,673
These are limiting terms. They don't
mean much now in a modern world.

710
01:34:27,673 --> 01:34:30,643
Alfonso Diaz was my friend.
Now he's dead.

711
01:34:30,643 --> 01:34:32,577
I wanna know what happened to him.

712
01:34:36,949 --> 01:34:39,918
He was reporting things
people didn't want reported.

713
01:34:40,319 --> 01:34:41,787
What did you think
was going to happen to him?

714
01:34:41,787 --> 01:34:44,824
- Who did it?
- Do you think I know that?

715
01:34:44,824 --> 01:34:47,593
Do you think I even concern myself
with such things?

716
01:34:47,593 --> 01:34:51,364
- It gets taken care of.
- Is Aris involved?

717
01:34:51,364 --> 01:34:54,600
How many more women is he gonna kill?
Why don't you tell somebody about it?

718
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:58,237
And who am I gonna tell?
These people know more than me.

719
01:34:58,237 --> 01:35:01,874
- Lf they arrest him, nothing'll change.
- He's a murderer.

720
01:35:01,874 --> 01:35:05,244
- He's protected by the authorities.
- You have to be realistic.

721
01:35:05,244 --> 01:35:07,213
There are two sets of laws
in any country, okay?

722
01:35:07,213 --> 01:35:11,117
The laws for rich and powerful people
and the laws for everybody else.

723
01:35:11,117 --> 01:35:12,919
And don't think it's any different
in the United States...

724
01:35:12,919 --> 01:35:16,650
because I buy politicians on both
sides of the border all the time.

725
01:35:16,856 --> 01:35:18,653
What do you think built this?

726
01:35:23,429 --> 01:35:24,726
Now...

727
01:35:27,099 --> 01:35:28,634
when can we get together again?

728
01:35:28,634 --> 01:35:31,737
I can free my schedule anytime.

729
01:35:31,737 --> 01:35:33,034
What do you say?

730
01:35:38,678 --> 01:35:41,203
I wish people like you didn't exist.

731
01:35:51,657 --> 01:35:53,426
And on top of everything else...

732
01:35:53,426 --> 01:35:55,826
you're a lousy god damned fuck.

733
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:21,118
The first shift has ended.
Please leave quickly.

734
01:36:22,788 --> 01:36:25,258
Vamanos. Let's go.

735
01:36:25,258 --> 01:36:27,089
They're shipping you back
to Juarez.

736
01:38:31,083 --> 01:38:32,345
Eva?

737
01:38:33,886 --> 01:38:35,046
Eva?

738
01:42:35,094 --> 01:42:39,030
It's morning and the court
will be in session soon.

739
01:42:42,635 --> 01:42:44,569
They're gonna be waiting for you.

740
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:49,671
We're both pretty beat up.

741
01:42:54,847 --> 01:42:58,749
Maybe if we help each other...

742
01:43:00,285 --> 01:43:02,116
well then we can make it.

743
01:43:38,257 --> 01:43:42,193
Eva testified against her attacker,
Domingo Esparza.

744
01:43:42,428 --> 01:43:44,362
He is awaiting trial.

745
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:48,764
Eva was reunited with her mother.

746
01:43:49,134 --> 01:43:52,331
They are being protected
by a human rights organization.

747
01:43:56,942 --> 01:44:01,845
Aris' body was found.
It was never claimed.

748
01:44:06,552 --> 01:44:10,147
No one was arrested
for the murder of Alfonso Diaz.

749
01:44:15,894 --> 01:44:18,192
I took over Diaz's paper.

750
01:44:19,164 --> 01:44:22,600
I continue to write to tell
the truth about Juarez.

751
01:44:25,370 --> 01:44:27,573
Congress passed the bill expanding
the free trade agreements...

752
01:44:27,573 --> 01:44:29,803
to Central America.

753
01:44:31,176 --> 01:44:34,475
There are still no provisions
protecting the workers.

754
01:44:38,884 --> 01:44:42,788
Last week another body
was found in the desert.

755
01:44:42,788 --> 01:44:46,781
A girl. About seventeen.

756
01:44:50,696 --> 01:44:54,291
She was still dressed
in her blue factory smock.

757
01:45:04,543 --> 01:45:07,512
The murder of woman
in Juarez continues.

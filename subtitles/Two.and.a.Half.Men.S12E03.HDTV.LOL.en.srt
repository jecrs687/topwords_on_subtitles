00:07:15,962 --> 00:07:17,161
I'm good.

176
00:07:17,163 --> 00:07:19,230
Um, I-I just got my 60-day chip.
Oh.

177
00:07:19,232 --> 00:07:22,567
And part of my recovery
is to make amends

178
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:23,768
to the people I've hurt.

179
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,203
So,

180
00:07:25,205 --> 00:07:28,306
I apologize for everything I did
to you while I was drinking.

181
00:07:28,308 --> 00:07:30,541
Oh, well, I appreciate that, um,

182
00:07:30,543 --> 00:07:32,543
but some of the things
you did to me,

183
00:07:32,545 --> 00:07:33,945
you don't have to apologize for.

184
00:07:35,115 --> 00:07:37,348
I mean, we had sex
in a Chipotle.

you ate my burrito.

186
00:07:44,758 --> 00:07:46,791
I ate your taco.

187
00:07:46,793 --> 00:07:49,594
And I later threw up
in your car.

188
00:07:49,596 --> 00:07:53,464
Yes, uh, but chunks weren't the
only thing you blew that day.

189
00:07:56,803 --> 00:08:00,571
Um, there is one other thing.

190
00:08:00,573 --> 00:08:04,042
If-if I haven't burned
too many bridges,

191
00:08:04,044 --> 00:08:07,678
I was wondering if maybe you
and I could give it another try.

192

193
00:08:08,748 --> 00:08:09,847
Wow, that-that
is flattering.

His Labradoodle

I-I got down on one knee,

...blue eyes,

216
00:09:02,569 --> 00:09:04,735
and I asked him to share
his life with me.

217
00:09:04,737 --> 00:09:06,971
I guess what
I'm getting at is the fact

218
00:09:06,973 --> 00:09:09,240
that you've both been
married to women before.

219
00:09:09,242 --> 00:09:11,075
So, when did you realize
you were gay?

220
00:09:11,077 --> 00:09:15,813
Oh, well, on some level,
I've always known. Um...

221
00:09:16,783 --> 00:09:19,350
I mean, throughout, uh,
both of my marriages,

222
00:09:19,352 --> 00:09:21,185
I was in complete denial.

223
00:09:21,187 --> 00:09:22,420
Um, but after I met Walden,

224
00:09:22,422 --> 00:09:25,089
I finally felt safe
to-to be myself.

225
00:09:25,091 --> 00:09:26,724
Uh, I remember
our first date.

226
00:09:26,726 --> 00:09:28,693
Uh, we went to the Bowl to
see the<i> Grease</i> sing-along.

Ah, “Tell me more,

Well, uh, Walden was
dressed as Danny Zuko,

229
00:09:32,966 --> 00:09:34,031
uh, and I was Sandy--

230
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:35,700
uh, hot Sandy, you
know, in the leather.

When did you know you were gay?

238
00:09:51,251 --> 00:09:54,919
I guess my first clue was
when I saw<i> Basic Instinct.</i>

239
00:09:56,022 --> 00:09:58,122
All my friends were looking up
Sharon Stone's skirt,

240
00:09:58,124 --> 00:10:00,358
and I was just looking
at her shoes.

241
00:10:01,661 --> 00:10:04,862
And I guess I got married
because of social pressures,

242
00:10:04,864 --> 00:10:08,099
but, eventually,
I had to be true to who I am.

243
00:10:08,101 --> 00:10:09,600
And I've never
looked back since.

244

Yeah, I see hundreds
of potential parents,

249
00:10:24,951 --> 00:10:26,284
but you two are
different somehow.

250
00:10:26,286 --> 00:10:27,518
I'm not sure what it is.

251
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,020
Well, uh, maybe it's the fact

252
00:10:29,022 --> 00:10:32,223
that I-I look like I'm wearing
makeup, but I'm not.

253

Y-You know, we may not be
like other couples, but...

254
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,829
I know we can be
good parents.

255
00:10:38,831 --> 00:10:40,565
I get that, but it is my job

256
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:42,900
to be a hundred percent sure
before I place a child.

I'm a g... Oh.

351
00:14:48,765 --> 00:14:50,832
...mother.

352
00:14:50,834 --> 00:14:52,934
Okay, um...

353
00:14:52,936 --> 00:14:55,470
maybe-maybe we should go
to my room a-and talk.

354
00:14:55,472 --> 00:14:59,474
I won't be able to talk much,
'cause my mouth will be full.

355
00:14:59,476 --> 00:15:00,541
Wink, wink.

356
00:15:00,543 --> 00:15:03,411
Hopefully with breath mints.

357
00:15:04,547 --> 00:15:07,648
You wait in here and I will
call a cab to take you home.

358
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:11,452
My home is in your pants.

359
00:15:11,454 --> 00:15:13,988
What happened? Why did
you start drinking again?

360
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,857
Well, 'cause you married Walden.

361
00:15:15,859 --> 00:15:18,459
The only person in your life
who's prettier than me.

362
00:15:18,461 --> 00:15:20,695
But you know we're just
doing that to get a kid.

363
00:15:20,697 --> 00:15:23,364
Yeah, but if I wasn't
so screwed up last year,

364
00:15:23,366 --> 00:15:24,932
then we would still be together.

365
00:15:24,934 --> 00:15:27,201
Then we could get married
and have a baby.

366
00:15:27,203 --> 00:15:29,070
We could sell that baby
to Walden.

367
00:15:29,072 --> 00:15:31,005
'Cause let's face it,

368
00:15:31,007 --> 00:15:32,940
we don't want to raise
another kid,

369
00:15:32,942 --> 00:15:34,776
'cause both our kids suck.

370
00:15:34,778 --> 00:15:37,412
Okay, uh, refreshing,
drunk honesty aside,

371
00:15:37,414 --> 00:15:38,679
um, d-don't blame yourself.

372
00:15:38,681 --> 00:15:40,114
We all made mistakes.

373
00:15:40,116 --> 00:15:42,617
But we shouldn't let those
mistakes ruin things for Walden.

374
00:15:42,619 --> 00:15:44,552
Shh. You talk too much.

375
00:15:44,554 --> 00:15:46,354
Let's party.

376
00:15:49,392 --> 00:15:51,626
Lyndsey? Lyndsey?

377
00:15:53,763 --> 00:15:56,864
Wow, a half-naked drunk girl
is in my bed and I'm leaving.

378
00:15:56,866 --> 00:15:58,533
Maybe I am gay.

379
00:15:59,669 --> 00:16:02,236
I like to imagine the
family gathered here,

380
00:16:02,238 --> 00:16:04,705
eating an all-organic,
gluten-free meal

381
00:16:04,707 --> 00:16:07,308
of quinoa salad
and kale chips

382
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,710
while watching the
original reality TV:

383
00:16:09,712 --> 00:16:12,180
a beautiful
ocean sunset.

384
00:16:12,182 --> 00:16:14,782
As long as this is a stable
environment for a child,

385
00:16:14,784 --> 00:16:16,684
I don't care
if you're eating Hot Pockets

386
00:16:16,686 --> 00:16:18,719
and watching<i> Honey Boo Boo.</i>

387
00:16:18,721 --> 00:16:21,789
Uh, uh, Wally Bear, uh, can
I borrow you for a minute?

388
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:24,392
Is it an emergency,
Alley Cat?

389
00:16:24,394 --> 00:16:28,429
Uh, it's more of a-a pickle, uh,
that needs immediate attention.

390
00:16:30,266 --> 00:16:31,799
Oh, it's okay. Go.

391
00:16:31,801 --> 00:16:34,469
Yeah, I would never come between
a man and his husband's pickle.

392
00:16:36,739 --> 00:16:39,273
Lyndsey's here.
She's drunk.

393
00:16:39,275 --> 00:16:40,408
Why?

394
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,742
She wants to have sex with me.

395
00:16:41,744 --> 00:16:43,644
Why?

396
00:16:43,646 --> 00:16:44,879
Wait... Where is she?

397
00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:46,314
She's passed out in my room.

398
00:16:46,316 --> 00:16:48,249
Okay, okay, we-we need
to get Ms. McMartin

399
00:16:48,251 --> 00:16:49,851
out of here as fast as we can.

400
00:16:49,853 --> 00:16:51,719
Right, right. Oh, um,
by the way, when Lyndsey

401
00:16:51,721 --> 00:16:53,354
tried to kiss me,
I was totally into it.

402
00:16:53,356 --> 00:16:54,455
I don't know why I was worried.

403
00:16:54,457 --> 00:16:56,190
Worried about what?

404
00:16:56,192 --> 00:16:58,059
Nothing. Let's get her
out of here.

405
00:16:59,362 --> 00:17:00,728
Mm. Everything okay?

406
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,531
Yes, we just had to reset the...
The, um...

407
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:04,832
...flaven
on the stave.

408
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:06,601
But, uh, everything's

409
00:17:06,603 --> 00:17:09,036
okay now. Uh, c-can
I get you anything?

410
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:10,705
Like directions for
your drive home, or...

411
00:17:10,707 --> 00:17:12,507
You know, I actually
do have to get going.

412
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:14,242
I did not realize it was this late.
What?

413
00:17:14,244 --> 00:17:15,977
No.
Oh.

414
00:17:15,979 --> 00:17:18,379
I'm so disappointed.
Oh.

415
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:20,448
I'll just get your things
and walk you out.

416
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,717
Oh. There we go.

417
00:17:22,719 --> 00:17:24,719
I got to say,
you look at that view

418
00:17:24,721 --> 00:17:25,920
and you never want to leave.

419
00:17:25,922 --> 00:17:27,855
And yet you must.

420
00:17:27,857 --> 00:17:29,524
Unless you want to adopt me.

421
00:17:29,526 --> 00:17:32,260
You're so funny.
Here's your jacket.

422
00:17:34,531 --> 00:17:35,696
Oh, my God.

423
00:17:35,698 --> 00:17:37,632
What?
Uh...

424
00:17:37,634 --> 00:17:39,467
This jacket,
it's-it's fantastic.

425
00:17:39,469 --> 00:17:42,036
What is this, wool?
I think so, yeah.

426
00:17:42,038 --> 00:17:44,138
Really? Because I... I would've
thought it was linen.

427
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,873
Doesn't it feel
“linen-sy”, Alan?

428
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,341
No, it's
definitely wool.

429
00:17:48,778 --> 00:17:50,645
Holy crap.
What?

430
00:17:50,647 --> 00:17:52,847
Uh... I forgot to
flip the cushions

431
00:17:52,849 --> 00:17:54,015
on the deck
furniture.

432
00:17:54,017 --> 00:17:55,283
Imagine the
mildew.

433
00:17:55,285 --> 00:17:57,485
Alan.

434
00:17:57,487 --> 00:17:59,687
Milady.

435
00:18:02,592 --> 00:18:04,659
Here we go,
almost got it.

436
00:18:04,661 --> 00:18:06,160
If you could
just stay still...

437
00:18:06,162 --> 00:18:07,595
Yeah... Oh.

438
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:12,500
Uh, all right, that's it.
That wasn't so hard, was it?

439
00:18:12,502 --> 00:18:14,468
Actually, it was a lot harder
than it needed to be, but...

440
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,837
That's what he said.

441
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:18,906
Uh, well...
Oh, your purse.

442
00:18:18,908 --> 00:18:20,575
Well, thank you, guys.

443
00:18:20,577 --> 00:18:22,076
Uh, you'll be hearing
from me soon.

444
00:18:22,078 --> 00:18:23,911
Got it. Bye.

445
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:27,748
Oh, my God.

446
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,150
Is Lyndsey okay?

447
00:18:29,152 --> 00:18:30,885
Oh, sure. She's practically
indestructible when she's drunk.

448
00:18:30,887 --> 00:18:32,787
I've seen her fall down
a flight of stairs

449
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:34,255
and not spill her mojito.

450
00:18:36,593 --> 00:18:39,860
I'm so sorry,
I forgot my phone.

451
00:18:39,862 --> 00:18:41,622
Oh. Here it is, right
here on the table. Hey.

452
00:18:41,637 --> 00:18:42,464
Oh, hey. Ho!

453
00:18:42,465 --> 00:18:44,098
Got it. And
get the hell out of here.

454
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,435
Oh, one last thing. Um, I'm not
supposed to say anything,

455
00:18:47,437 --> 00:18:49,470
but unless something
crazy happens,

456
00:18:49,472 --> 00:18:50,938
you're gonna get approved.

457
00:18:51,608 --> 00:18:52,640
Seriously?

458
00:18:52,642 --> 00:18:53,908
Get out of here.

459
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,109
Seriously.

460
00:18:55,111 --> 00:18:58,079
I'm here to help
with the baby.

461
00:18:58,081 --> 00:18:59,113
Seriously?

462
00:18:59,115 --> 00:19:00,314
Who is this?

463
00:19:00,316 --> 00:19:01,616
Uh, uh, she is...

464
00:19:01,618 --> 00:19:04,485
Oh, you know what,
this happens all the time.

465
00:19:04,487 --> 00:19:06,354
Tourists get an out-of-date
map to celebrity homes.

466
00:19:06,356 --> 00:19:10,825
Honey, Charlie Sheen
doesn't live here anymore.

467
00:19:10,827 --> 00:19:13,227
Lyndsey?

468
00:19:13,229 --> 00:19:14,695
Hi.

469
00:19:14,697 --> 00:19:15,830
And who is this?

470
00:19:15,832 --> 00:19:18,299
I fell down
in the sand.

471
00:19:18,301 --> 00:19:19,800
This is...

472
00:19:19,802 --> 00:19:22,136
I'm the next-door
neighbor. Hi.

473
00:19:22,138 --> 00:19:23,404
Uh, we were having
a get-together

474
00:19:23,406 --> 00:19:24,739
and this one got away.

475
00:19:24,741 --> 00:19:26,307
Our next-door neighbor.
That... Oh, that's right,

476
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:27,375
I remember you

477
00:19:27,377 --> 00:19:29,243
from the Fourth of
July block party.

478
00:19:29,245 --> 00:19:31,779
Yeah... Oh, which, by the way,
is amazing for kids.

479
00:19:31,781 --> 00:19:33,314
A waterslide,
shaved ice.

480
00:19:33,316 --> 00:19:35,850
My waterslide's
shaved.

481
00:19:35,852 --> 00:19:38,386
Okay, time to go home.

482
00:19:38,388 --> 00:19:39,720
And, um, you know what?

483
00:19:39,722 --> 00:19:41,956
These guys are great.
Ask anyone on our block.

484
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,658
We're all pulling for them
to get a kid.

485
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,493
Thank you.
You're very sweet.

No, where are you
taking me?

488

490

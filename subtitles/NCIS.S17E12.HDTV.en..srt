00:00:03,219 --> 00:00:04,563

position and hold on deck.

3
00:00:06,088 --> 00:00:08,889
PILOT:
287, position and hold.

4
00:00:08,958 --> 00:00:11,491
(indistinct radio chatter)

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,394
302 Mother,
come around to heading 080.

6
00:00:14,463 --> 00:00:17,364
302 Mother.

7
00:00:17,433 --> 00:00:20,234
302, please ident.

8
00:00:22,238 --> 00:00:25,005
Sir, we may have
something brewing.

9
00:00:25,074 --> 00:00:26,173
Who is it?

10
00:00:26,242 --> 00:00:27,941
Weeks. On a post-maintenance
check flight.

11
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,010
She's gone wandering.

12
00:00:32,681 --> 00:00:34,882
What is she doing
way out there?

13
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,550
Don't know, sir.
She's nonresponsive.

14
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,552
OFFICER:
302 Mother.

15
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:40,888
Weeks, are you there?

16
00:00:40,956 --> 00:00:43,056
305 Mother,

17
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:44,725
we have a situation here.

18
00:00:44,793 --> 00:00:46,693
Need you to vector to 230

19
00:00:46,762 --> 00:00:47,694
and check on Weeks.

20
00:00:47,763 --> 00:00:48,962
PILOT:
Negative.

21
00:00:49,031 --> 00:00:51,131
I don't have the fuel
to get out there and back.

22
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,634
Garcia, what's her heading?

23
00:00:53,702 --> 00:00:56,303
Bearing 260. Speed,

24
00:00:56,372 --> 00:00:58,338
700 knots.
Altitude,

25
00:00:58,407 --> 00:01:00,540
18,000 and descending.

26
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:02,009
Descending?

27
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,146
OFFICER:
Weeks, Mother.

28
00:01:06,215 --> 00:01:07,648
Switch to guard freq

29
00:01:07,716 --> 00:01:10,450
and squawk if you hear me.

30
00:01:12,054 --> 00:01:13,765
MAN (on P.A.): Flight deck in starboard.
(alarm blaring)

31
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:16,323
Rescue and assistance teams
to the ready room.

32
00:01:16,392 --> 00:01:18,992
Flight deck,
prepare the starboard.

33
00:01:19,061 --> 00:01:21,061
Rescue and assistance teams
to the ready room.

34
00:01:24,066 --> 00:01:27,401
Commander, we may have
an unconscious pilot up there.

35
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:29,269
Heading?
East-southeast.

36
00:01:29,338 --> 00:01:30,570
Altitude 8,000
and dropping.

37
00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:32,506
She'll hit the mainland
in 90 seconds.

38
00:01:32,574 --> 00:01:35,642
Weeks? Commander May.

39
00:01:35,711 --> 00:01:37,411
Need you to wake up, Lieutenant.

40
00:01:40,749 --> 00:01:42,282
Sir, if she's hypoxic,

41
00:01:42,351 --> 00:01:44,029
we should implement
the White Knife protocol.

42
00:01:44,053 --> 00:01:45,585
We're not shooting down
my pilot.

43
00:01:45,654 --> 00:01:47,120
Sir, we need to...
Give it a minute.

44
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:50,924
Weeks, talk to me.

45
00:01:50,993 --> 00:01:54,161
Sir, she will be over
a population center

46
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:55,662
in 40 seconds.

47
00:01:56,899 --> 00:01:59,032
MAY: Weeks, talk to me.
COMPUTER: Pull up.

48
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:00,968
Pull up.
WEEKS: I'm sorry.

49
00:02:01,036 --> 00:02:03,503
MAY: Rebecca!
Pull up. Pull up.

50
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,040
Weeks, you there?
Say again.

51
00:02:09,778 --> 00:02:11,645
Sir.

52
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:13,714
We've lost radar contact.

53
00:02:13,782 --> 00:02:15,749
Aircraft impacted the ocean.

54
00:02:15,818 --> 00:02:17,551
She bail out?
She eject?

55
00:02:17,619 --> 00:02:19,219
No, sir.

60
00:02:57,926 --> 00:03:01,194
but the ambulance-- he didn't
even have his lights on.

Hmm. Yeah.
Yeah?

62
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,900
That's it? That's all
you're gonna give me?

63
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:08,668
That's a funny story, Tim.

64
00:03:08,737 --> 00:03:10,904
All you give me is "yeah"?

65
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:13,073
You've said two words
this morning.

66
00:03:13,142 --> 00:03:16,209
Yeah, sorry, I got...
I got a lot on my mind.

67
00:03:16,278 --> 00:03:18,879
Hey, listen, I'm here
if you want to talk.

68
00:03:18,947 --> 00:03:20,881
I appreciate that,
but, uh,

69
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:23,016
I don't really want
to get into it, you know.

70
00:03:23,085 --> 00:03:25,719
Besides, Bishop is,
like, right there, so...

71
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,087
(whispering):
What did she do?

72
00:03:27,156 --> 00:03:28,288
She didn't do anything.

73
00:03:31,727 --> 00:03:32,926
I'm getting a vasectomy.

74
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:35,762
Oh. Oh, oh.

75
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:37,531
Oh.

76
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,433
I'm sorry.

77
00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:41,568
No, don't be sorry.
It's a good thing.

78
00:03:41,637 --> 00:03:43,203
Getting surgery is
a good thing?

79
00:03:43,272 --> 00:03:44,704
Getting surgery down there...

80
00:03:44,773 --> 00:03:47,274
I know where
they do it, Nick.

81
00:03:47,342 --> 00:03:50,177
And you still said yes?
Yes.

82
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:52,012
Yeah, you know,
Delilah and I decided

83
00:03:52,081 --> 00:03:53,947
one set of twins is enough.

84
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:57,517
I mean, we-we had
a scare last month, so...

85
00:03:57,586 --> 00:03:58,919
Why can't she do it?

86
00:03:58,987 --> 00:04:01,254
I would never ask her
to do something like that.

87
00:04:01,323 --> 00:04:02,689
So she said no, huh?

88
00:04:02,758 --> 00:04:03,690
Decisively.

89
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,659
Damn. But what if they...

90
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,629
...like, snip on the wrong wire?

91
00:04:09,698 --> 00:04:11,364
It's not a bomb, Nick.

92
00:04:11,433 --> 00:04:13,133
Besides, there's
no knives involved.

93
00:04:13,202 --> 00:04:16,103
I chose the "no scalpel" option.

94
00:04:16,171 --> 00:04:19,206
How are they gonna cut
anything without a knife?

95
00:04:19,274 --> 00:04:21,608
I'm not sure.

96
00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:22,909
Science?

97
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:25,612
Bishop, grab your go bag.

98
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:27,547
F-18 went down
in the Atlantic.

99
00:04:27,616 --> 00:04:29,316
Helo's waiting.

100
00:04:29,384 --> 00:04:30,884
Uh, where to?

101
00:04:30,953 --> 00:04:32,319
The <i>Franklin Roosevelt.</i>

102
00:04:33,655 --> 00:04:36,389
You two stay here, dig up
all you can on the pilot.

103
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,058
Sir.

104
00:04:39,895 --> 00:04:42,762
Lieutenant Rebecca Weeks.

105
00:04:42,831 --> 00:04:46,333
MAY: <i>Lieutenant Weeks was</i>
<i>the best I had.</i>

106
00:04:46,401 --> 00:04:47,767
Brilliant pilot,
highly decorated,

107
00:04:47,836 --> 00:04:50,137
on a routine training mission
on a perfect day for flying.

108
00:04:50,205 --> 00:04:51,938
She wasn't able to eject?
No, ma'am.

109
00:04:52,007 --> 00:04:53,406
Any idea why?

110
00:04:53,475 --> 00:04:55,575
She had to be suffering
from hypoxia.

111
00:04:55,644 --> 00:04:56,743
Lack of oxygen?

112
00:04:56,812 --> 00:04:58,945
That's the only explanation
that makes sense.

113
00:04:59,014 --> 00:05:01,348
The onboard oxygen
generating system malfunctions,

114
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,517
things can go south fast.

115
00:05:03,585 --> 00:05:04,818
She make a distress call?

116
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,921
No, sir, but hypoxia
can make a pilot become

117
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,990
disoriented, confused
or unconscious.

118
00:05:10,058 --> 00:05:12,259
We understand that
she said "I'm sorry"

119
00:05:12,327 --> 00:05:13,360
before the accident,

120
00:05:13,428 --> 00:05:16,429
so she wasn't unconscious then.
Correct.

121
00:05:16,498 --> 00:05:18,331
Any other idea why
she might have apologized?

122
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,044
I know what you're thinking,
and I'll stop you right there.

123
00:05:20,068 --> 00:05:23,270
She was not the type of person
to commit suicide.

124
00:05:23,338 --> 00:05:26,106
I didn't know suicide
had a type.

125
00:05:26,175 --> 00:05:27,752
We'll need the cockpit
recording, Commander,

126
00:05:27,776 --> 00:05:29,442
and the telemetry.

127
00:05:29,511 --> 00:05:30,810
You got it.

128
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:33,613
Listen, Lieutenant Weeks
was not just my pilot,

129
00:05:33,682 --> 00:05:35,282
she was a family friend.

130
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,551
Anything you need,
just ask.

131
00:05:37,619 --> 00:05:39,352
Lieutenant Logan
is Weeks' bunkmate.

132
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:40,509
She'll take you
the rest of the way.

133
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:41,722
Yes, sir.

134
00:05:41,723 --> 00:05:42,889
Thank you, Commander.

135
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,858
Follow me, please.

136
00:05:46,395 --> 00:05:48,862
We're sorry about
what happened.

137
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:49,931
Thank you, ma'am.

138
00:05:49,965 --> 00:05:51,798
You have not been
in your quarters

139
00:05:51,867 --> 00:05:53,077
since the accident, Lieutenant?

140
00:05:53,101 --> 00:05:56,403
No, sir. Orders were to wait
until you arrived.

141
00:05:59,474 --> 00:06:01,041
(screams)

142
00:06:11,527 --> 00:06:14,528
MAY: Weeks, talk to me.
COMPUTER: Pull up. Pull up.

143
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:16,398
WEEKS:
I'm sorry.

144
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:18,232
MAY: Rebecca.
Pull up. Pull...

145
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,067
That's it?

146
00:06:20,136 --> 00:06:21,668
That's it.

147
00:06:21,737 --> 00:06:24,138
14 seconds later,
the F-18 hit the ocean.

148
00:06:24,206 --> 00:06:25,906
Have they found
the wreckage yet?

149
00:06:25,975 --> 00:06:27,975
Still looking.

150
00:06:28,044 --> 00:06:30,477
VANCE: What are you sorry about,
Lieutenant?

151
00:06:30,546 --> 00:06:33,414
Maybe the dead guy in her bunk?
Right.

152
00:06:33,482 --> 00:06:35,516
What do we know
about the victim?

153
00:06:35,584 --> 00:06:37,251
Well, Petty Officer First Class

154
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,153
Fisher Patrick.
21 years old,

155
00:06:39,221 --> 00:06:40,521
ship quartermaster.

156
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:43,123
Jimmy choppered him back
to NCIS this morning.

157
00:06:43,192 --> 00:06:44,436
Torres is talking
to his mother now.

158
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,960
Any connection between
him and Lieutenant Weeks?

159
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:48,495
Well, their duties
didn't overlap,

160
00:06:48,564 --> 00:06:49,964
so they wouldn't have
crossed paths,

161
00:06:50,032 --> 00:06:52,466
but they lived on
the same ship, so it's possible

162
00:06:52,535 --> 00:06:55,302
they knew each other.
Oh, they knew each other.

163
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:56,603
They were dating.

164
00:06:56,672 --> 00:06:58,972
His mom said they kept
their relationship a secret.

165
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,942
Ah, because officers dating
enlisted is prohibited.

166
00:07:02,011 --> 00:07:04,378
So are we talking
murder-suicide?

167
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,180
Or suicide-suicide.
(phone dings)

168
00:07:06,248 --> 00:07:07,881
Let's see what Palmer
has to say.

169
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,284
He's done with the autopsy.
Okay.

170
00:07:10,352 --> 00:07:12,052
JIMMY:
<i>I know, but</i>

171
00:07:12,121 --> 00:07:14,221
swollen glands are
completely normal.

172
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,834
I tell you what,
just pump her full of fluids

173
00:07:15,858 --> 00:07:18,792
and if she spikes above 103,
just give me a call.

174
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:20,794
Yeah, love you.

175
00:07:20,863 --> 00:07:23,497
Hey. Everything okay?
Yeah, Victoria's running a fever,

176
00:07:23,566 --> 00:07:25,466
and Breena's stressing out.

177
00:07:25,534 --> 00:07:27,512
She just wants to make sure
she's doing everything right.

178
00:07:27,536 --> 00:07:29,970
You know?
Yeah, I get it.

179
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:31,972
Good thing she's got
a doctor on call, huh?

180
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,874
(both chuckle)

181
00:07:33,943 --> 00:07:37,644
You guys ever-ever think about
giving her a younger sibling?

182
00:07:37,713 --> 00:07:39,847
You know, it's funny
you mention that.

183
00:07:39,915 --> 00:07:42,249
It's not like we're
advertising it or anything,

184
00:07:42,318 --> 00:07:44,218
but I think we're gonna
try for one more

185
00:07:44,286 --> 00:07:45,486
before I close up shop.

186
00:07:45,554 --> 00:07:49,389
Good for you.
That's great.

187
00:07:51,994 --> 00:07:53,760
Let me ask you, uh,
closing up shop--

188
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:56,363
is that as easy as,
uh, doctors say?

189
00:07:56,432 --> 00:07:58,699
You're thinking of doing it.

190
00:07:58,767 --> 00:08:00,212
Well, no, I'm not
just thinking about it,

191
00:08:00,236 --> 00:08:01,935
I'm actually...
I'm actually doing it.

192
00:08:04,473 --> 00:08:06,607
Had a conversation
with Torres earlier,

193
00:08:06,675 --> 00:08:08,842
and it kind of
made me fidgety.

194
00:08:08,911 --> 00:08:11,879
Oh, don't listen to Torres.
He probably read that clickbait

195
00:08:11,947 --> 00:08:15,749
horror story online about the
guy with the weird complication.

196
00:08:17,086 --> 00:08:19,286
What-what guy with
the weird complication?

197
00:08:19,355 --> 00:08:20,721
I wouldn't look it up.

198
00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:24,625
The point is male sterilization
is simple, and it is safe.

199
00:08:24,693 --> 00:08:27,427
I mean, you probably won't even
miss a full day of work, Tim.

200
00:08:27,496 --> 00:08:29,824
Oh, that's great. Great.
Thank you, Jimmy.

201
00:08:29,848 --> 00:08:30,932
Mm.

202
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:33,233
Um, when they say...
they say no scalpel,

203
00:08:33,302 --> 00:08:34,468
they mean no scalpel, right?

204
00:08:34,537 --> 00:08:35,702
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah.

205
00:08:35,771 --> 00:08:38,038
The doctors use
a clamp and a needle

206
00:08:38,107 --> 00:08:39,147
It's actually really neat.

207
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,785
I can show you...
No, I'm good, I'm good.

208
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:41,809
I'm good.

209
00:08:41,844 --> 00:08:44,878
No demonstration needed.
Thank you, though.

210
00:08:44,947 --> 00:08:47,092
Let's, uh, let's-let's talk
about this guy for a minute.

211
00:08:47,116 --> 00:08:49,449
Gladly, yes. Uh,

212
00:08:49,518 --> 00:08:51,051
Petty Officer Patrick

213
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,820
died of a cardiac arrest

214
00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:56,757
caused by a massive amount
of oxycodone.

215
00:08:56,825 --> 00:08:57,925
How massive?

216
00:08:57,993 --> 00:08:59,593
He had over 300 milligrams
in his system.

217
00:08:59,628 --> 00:09:00,827
That's a lot of pills.

218
00:09:00,896 --> 00:09:03,497
Yeah, that is way more
than a recreational dose.

219
00:09:03,566 --> 00:09:06,500
So what do you think,
suicide or homicide?

220
00:09:06,569 --> 00:09:07,801
See, that he is not
telling me.

221
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,837
But if I had to
venture a guess,

222
00:09:10,906 --> 00:09:12,272
I would lean towards homicide.

223
00:09:12,341 --> 00:09:14,708
Why is that?
His stomach contents.

224
00:09:14,777 --> 00:09:17,411
He had bacon, eggs,

225
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:20,781
avocado, potatoes
and cantaloupe.

226
00:09:20,849 --> 00:09:23,016
Well, maybe he just
wanted one last meal.

227
00:09:23,085 --> 00:09:24,818
Yeah, maybe, but...

228
00:09:24,887 --> 00:09:27,988
I've seen my share
of poison suicides down here,

229
00:09:28,057 --> 00:09:30,424
and they rarely eat beforehand.

230
00:09:31,493 --> 00:09:34,361
Interferes with the poison.

231
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,263
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

232
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,335
"Take one tablet every
four to six hours

233
00:09:41,403 --> 00:09:43,670
as needed for the pain."

234
00:09:43,739 --> 00:09:45,606
Well, we know where
he got the oxy from.

235
00:09:45,674 --> 00:09:46,940
His girlfriend.

236
00:09:48,544 --> 00:09:49,977
Those pills beige?

237
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,312
Yeah.
How'd you know that?

238
00:09:52,381 --> 00:09:54,548
Well, this was in her lockbox.

239
00:09:54,617 --> 00:09:58,018
Is that oxy in powder form?

240
00:09:59,955 --> 00:10:01,455
Same color powder on this.

241
00:10:01,523 --> 00:10:04,858
Makeshift pill crusher.
(knocking)

242
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,793
Uh, yeah, come on in.

243
00:10:06,862 --> 00:10:08,929
Excuse me.
You wanted to see me?

244
00:10:08,998 --> 00:10:11,231
Yeah, uh, Lieutenant,
we just, uh...

245
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,460
we have a few questions
to ask you about your bunkmate.

246
00:10:14,803 --> 00:10:16,470
Uh,

247
00:10:16,538 --> 00:10:19,006
I don't want
to say anything bad.

248
00:10:19,074 --> 00:10:21,141
What does that mean?

249
00:10:22,645 --> 00:10:24,177
I'm gonna go see the commander.
Okay.

250
00:10:24,246 --> 00:10:25,812
You two chat.

251
00:10:29,285 --> 00:10:30,817
Listen, Harper,

252
00:10:30,886 --> 00:10:34,321
we're just trying to figure out
what happened here.

253
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,722
We already know that Weeks

254
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,491
and Petty Officer Patrick
were dating.

255
00:10:39,128 --> 00:10:41,061
I would help her

256
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,063
sneak him in some nights.

257
00:10:43,132 --> 00:10:44,865
He's not allowed on O-1.

258
00:10:44,933 --> 00:10:46,833
Any problems
in their relationship?

259
00:10:46,902 --> 00:10:48,769
I didn't think so,

260
00:10:48,837 --> 00:10:51,505
not until they
broke up last week.

261
00:10:51,573 --> 00:10:53,040
Who ended it?

262
00:10:53,108 --> 00:10:56,443
He dumped her. Told her
she was too old for him.

263
00:10:56,512 --> 00:10:58,278
Oh, wow. Classy.

264
00:10:58,347 --> 00:11:00,414
She was...

265
00:11:00,482 --> 00:11:02,449
pretty pissed off.

266
00:11:02,518 --> 00:11:04,785
Pissed off enough to kill him?

267
00:11:06,088 --> 00:11:09,389
Wait, Fisher was murdered?

268
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,792
It's looking like that, yeah.

269
00:11:13,662 --> 00:11:16,530
What? Lieutenant,

270
00:11:16,598 --> 00:11:19,132
if you know something,
now is the time to say it.

271
00:11:20,169 --> 00:11:21,735
It's just, she told me

272
00:11:21,804 --> 00:11:23,537
that he was going to be

273
00:11:23,605 --> 00:11:25,706
very sorry for dumping her.

274
00:11:27,676 --> 00:11:31,211
They're en route to the crash
site. Awaiting your orders.

275
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,814
Okay, expand the search grid
three miles northeast.

276
00:11:33,882 --> 00:11:36,616
Yes, sir.

277
00:11:36,685 --> 00:11:38,585
Any luck finding
the wreckage?

278
00:11:38,654 --> 00:11:40,554
Yes.

279
00:11:40,622 --> 00:11:42,289
Parts of a wing.

280
00:11:42,358 --> 00:11:43,924
We've been combing
the ocean all day

281
00:11:43,992 --> 00:11:47,461
and the biggest piece we found
is 18 inches long.

282
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:49,830
That aircraft was obliterated.

283
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:52,432
Sorry.

284
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:54,101
You know,
in the back of my mind,

285
00:11:54,169 --> 00:11:55,669
I was holding out hope
that somehow

286
00:11:55,738 --> 00:11:57,504
Weeks survived the crash,

287
00:11:57,573 --> 00:12:00,574
but finding pieces that small...

288
00:12:02,544 --> 00:12:04,511
How's your investigation
going topside?

289
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,279
Coming along.

290
00:12:06,348 --> 00:12:09,850
The hell was he doing
in Weeks' bunk?

291
00:12:09,918 --> 00:12:12,285
You didn't know
they were a couple?

292
00:12:12,354 --> 00:12:13,787
No.

293
00:12:13,856 --> 00:12:17,591
Why was Weeks prescribed
oxycodone last month?

294
00:12:17,659 --> 00:12:19,359
She took a hard landing.

295
00:12:19,428 --> 00:12:21,428
Harness jammed
her shoulder real good.

296
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:25,665
Did the petty officer
OD on oxy?

297
00:12:27,102 --> 00:12:28,480
Could he have drugged Weeks
before her flight?

298
00:12:28,504 --> 00:12:30,036
That could explain the crash.

299
00:12:30,105 --> 00:12:33,440
Or it was the other way
around-- she drugged him.

300
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:35,475
If you're implying
Lieutenant Weeks

301
00:12:35,544 --> 00:12:37,811
killed that sailor,
you're way off-base.

302
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,280
I won't let you disparage
her good name, not in this room,

303
00:12:40,349 --> 00:12:42,983
and not on this ship.

304
00:12:43,051 --> 00:12:44,684
I have work to do.

305
00:12:49,858 --> 00:12:51,892
What's up?
Nick, look at this.

306
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,360
When a pilot ejects,

307
00:12:53,429 --> 00:12:55,662
they experience
the greatest g-forces

308
00:12:55,731 --> 00:12:57,564
ever felt by a human.

309
00:12:57,633 --> 00:12:59,699
Up to 22 times
the force of gravity.

310
00:12:59,768 --> 00:13:01,902
It's like hitting
a brick wall of air.

311
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,870
Ejecting can
break bones,

312
00:13:03,939 --> 00:13:06,306
it can injure spines,
it can damage lungs.

313
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,886
Yeah, it beats
the alternative, though.

314
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,743
Oh, exactly. Most pilots
survive ejection,

315
00:13:09,812 --> 00:13:10,977
which is all that matters.

316
00:13:11,046 --> 00:13:12,813
Hey, why are you
showing me this?

317
00:13:12,881 --> 00:13:14,581
Lieutenant Weeks didn't eject.

318
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,651
Right. No, she absolutely
did not eject.

319
00:13:18,754 --> 00:13:20,554
Except I think she did.

320
00:13:20,622 --> 00:13:22,522
What? Why?
Okay.

321
00:13:22,591 --> 00:13:24,891
In an F-18, when
a pilot ejects,

322
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,893
an electronic locator
starts transmitting,

323
00:13:26,962 --> 00:13:28,762
so rescuers can find them.

324
00:13:28,831 --> 00:13:30,530
No, the Navy said
that didn't happen.

325
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:33,433
It didn't because according
to the telemetry,

326
00:13:33,502 --> 00:13:36,870
she disengaged that transmitter
right before she crashed.

327
00:13:36,939 --> 00:13:38,572
You're saying she did that
on purpose?

328
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,842
Absolutely. She would've had to
cut a wire under her seat.

329
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,710
Why would she do that?

330
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:45,879
I can only think of one reason

331
00:13:45,948 --> 00:13:48,849
why she'd want to
eject below radar

332
00:13:48,917 --> 00:13:50,917
without anyone knowing.

333
00:13:52,955 --> 00:13:55,922
To fake her own death.

334
00:14:03,506 --> 00:14:06,940
Yo.
That water is ice-cold.

335
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:08,308
Well, yeah, it's winter.

336
00:14:08,377 --> 00:14:10,177
I don't know, man.

337
00:14:10,246 --> 00:14:12,346
It's a long way
for someone to swim

338
00:14:12,414 --> 00:14:13,580
in freezing water.

339
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:15,349
Well, she wouldn't
have had to swim.

340
00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:17,751
Ejection kits come
included with, uh,

341
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,520
one-man inflatable rafts,

342
00:14:19,588 --> 00:14:21,155
and SR-2 survival vests.

343
00:14:21,223 --> 00:14:23,957
Wow. The Navy
thinks of everything.

344
00:14:24,026 --> 00:14:25,993
Yup.

345
00:14:27,329 --> 00:14:31,098
Hey, man, I just
wanted to say, uh,

346
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:34,234
I'm sorry about making such
a big deal about your surgery.

347
00:14:35,871 --> 00:14:37,471
I'm sure it's
gonna be fine.

348
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,773
Appreciate that.

349
00:14:39,842 --> 00:14:43,310
I just think it's weird, man.
I'm just thinking about somebody

350
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:44,978
messing around down
there, you know?

351
00:14:45,047 --> 00:14:47,848
Remember that
movie, um...

352
00:14:47,917 --> 00:14:50,317
<i>Edward Scissorhands?</i>

353
00:14:50,386 --> 00:14:52,703
Why would you put that image
in my head?

354
00:14:52,704 --> 00:14:54,199
I'm just saying that's the image
in my head.

355
00:14:54,223 --> 00:14:55,489
Well, now it's
in my head, okay?

356
00:14:55,558 --> 00:14:57,858
What's in your head?

357
00:14:57,927 --> 00:14:59,827
Oh, great. (chuckles)
You guys made it.

358
00:14:59,895 --> 00:15:02,296
Yeah. Ship was in Norfolk,
we drove straight here.

359
00:15:02,364 --> 00:15:03,831
Talk to me, McGee.

360
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:05,966
Well, Navy pinpoints
the crash site at about

361
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:08,402
4.2 miles southeast
of here.

362
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,948
Kasie and I took a look
at the tide charts,

363
00:15:09,972 --> 00:15:12,406
guesstimate the
lieutenant came ashore

364
00:15:12,474 --> 00:15:13,994
right around this
stretch of the beach.

365
00:15:14,277 --> 00:15:16,745
Assuming she survived
the ejection.

366
00:15:16,813 --> 00:15:18,446
She survived.

367
00:15:24,588 --> 00:15:26,588
Something was dragged
through here.

368
00:15:39,803 --> 00:15:42,103
Yeah, here's the flight suit.

369
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,407
Oh, still damp.

370
00:15:45,475 --> 00:15:47,809
Here's a survival vest,

371
00:15:47,878 --> 00:15:50,979
flares,
smoke signals, unused.

372
00:15:51,047 --> 00:15:52,647
She didn't want
to attract attention.

373
00:15:52,716 --> 00:15:54,293
Yeah, which is why
she buried everything.

374
00:15:54,317 --> 00:15:55,884
Not everything.

375
00:15:55,952 --> 00:15:57,552
Supposed to be a Glock
in that vest.

376
00:15:57,621 --> 00:15:58,987
All right, now she's got a gun.

377
00:15:59,055 --> 00:16:01,222
Uh, I've got a map
of the area--

378
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:04,225
closest town is four miles away.

379
00:16:04,294 --> 00:16:06,294
Likely on foot.
Where's the nearest structure?

380
00:16:06,363 --> 00:16:08,296
Stand by.

381
00:16:08,365 --> 00:16:10,131
Okay, so there's
a bait and tackle shop

382
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,367
half a mile
up the road.

383
00:16:14,671 --> 00:16:16,771
Hey, Nick, you're with me.

384
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,675
McGee, Bishop,
check out the area.

385
00:16:20,744 --> 00:16:23,678
You got it, boss.

386
00:16:23,747 --> 00:16:26,347
Well, I don't see any
security cameras anywhere.

387
00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:30,652
What?

388
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,455
You okay?
Well, yeah. Why?

389
00:16:33,523 --> 00:16:35,690
I heard you and Torres

390
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,692
whispering about surgery.

391
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:39,327
Oh, geez. No.

392
00:16:39,396 --> 00:16:42,363
It's-it-it-it's so not
a big deal. It's nothing.

393
00:16:42,432 --> 00:16:45,033
I appreciate
your concern, Bishop,

394
00:16:45,101 --> 00:16:47,168
okay? But...
No buts, okay?

395
00:16:47,237 --> 00:16:50,071
You can't tell Torres and
not me. I've known you longer.

396
00:16:51,107 --> 00:16:53,107
You're right.

397
00:16:54,878 --> 00:16:58,313
I'm getting a procedure
done, okay?

398
00:16:58,381 --> 00:17:01,382
An elective operation...

399
00:17:03,186 --> 00:17:06,855
...to rectify a situation

400
00:17:06,923 --> 00:17:09,457
with, um...

401
00:17:11,027 --> 00:17:14,629
I'm gonna go look over there
for a second.

402
00:17:14,698 --> 00:17:17,999
Oh...

403
00:17:18,068 --> 00:17:19,200
Oh.

404
00:17:19,269 --> 00:17:21,836
Hey, McGee.

405
00:17:21,905 --> 00:17:23,638
MAN:
Yep. She was here, all right.

406
00:17:23,707 --> 00:17:26,374
You talk to her, Mr. Douglas?

407
00:17:26,443 --> 00:17:29,577
Ah, you call me Bobby Dale.
Uh, yeah, we spoke.

408
00:17:29,646 --> 00:17:31,746
Um, nice young lady.

409
00:17:31,815 --> 00:17:33,915
She... little
bit strange.

410
00:17:33,984 --> 00:17:37,252
Strange how?
Poor thing was cold and wet.

411
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,188
Said she went swimming
in the ocean, you believe that?

412
00:17:40,257 --> 00:17:41,723
This time of year.

413
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,157
She come alone?

414
00:17:43,226 --> 00:17:44,859
(clears throat)
Yep. Alone

415
00:17:44,928 --> 00:17:47,662
and on foot.
Told you, strange.

416
00:17:47,731 --> 00:17:49,208
I didn't know she was
military, otherwise

417
00:17:49,232 --> 00:17:50,598
I'd have given
her a discount.

418
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:51,933
What'd she buy?

419
00:17:52,002 --> 00:17:53,535
Oh, she bought herself a jacket,

420
00:17:53,603 --> 00:17:56,437
of course, and then,
um, some snacks,

421
00:17:56,506 --> 00:18:00,275
a local map, uh, couple other
things. Tell me, what'd she do

422
00:18:00,343 --> 00:18:02,911
to get herself
caught up in NCIS?

423
00:18:02,979 --> 00:18:05,246
That one.

424
00:18:05,315 --> 00:18:08,783
What else she buy?
Um, well, she bought herself

425
00:18:08,852 --> 00:18:10,552
a Flathead
screwdriver,

426
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,887
copper wire, and
electrical tape.

427
00:18:12,956 --> 00:18:14,856
Huh. Uh-oh.

428
00:18:14,925 --> 00:18:16,591
What, "uh-oh"?

429
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,192
You happen to drive
a motorcycle?

430
00:18:18,261 --> 00:18:21,062
Yeah, how the hell
did you know that?

431
00:18:21,131 --> 00:18:23,631
I caused a lot of trouble with
those three things as a kid.

432
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:33,107
Oh, come on, man.

433
00:18:33,176 --> 00:18:35,109
What'd we miss?

434
00:18:35,178 --> 00:18:36,878
Weeks was here.

435
00:18:38,315 --> 00:18:40,214
She hot-wired his motorcycle.

436
00:18:46,656 --> 00:18:50,091
Checkpoints at five-mile
intervals on Highway 12.

437
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,461
All bridges from the Outer Banks
to the mainland shut down.

438
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,930
Yes, sir.
Your fugitive is a murder suspect,

439
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:57,465
armed with a Glock

440
00:18:57,534 --> 00:19:00,101
and riding a red
Honda SR-400 motorcycle.

441
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,637
Her name is Lieutenant
Rebecca Weeks.

442
00:19:02,706 --> 00:19:04,172
Got it.
Sir? Secretary Leo.

443
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,608
I'll be with her in a moment.

444
00:19:06,676 --> 00:19:08,309
She's trapped
on an island, Colonel.

445
00:19:08,378 --> 00:19:10,144
I expect North Carolina
Highway Patrol

446
00:19:10,213 --> 00:19:11,679
to make sure she stays there.

447
00:19:11,748 --> 00:19:13,181
We'll find her.

448
00:19:13,249 --> 00:19:15,583
Madam Undersecretary,
thank you for waiting.

449
00:19:15,652 --> 00:19:18,786
Director.
I thought this pilot was dead.

450
00:19:18,855 --> 00:19:21,022
That's exactly what she
wanted us to think, ma'am.

451
00:19:21,091 --> 00:19:24,158
Turns out she ejected
before the plane crashed.

452
00:19:24,227 --> 00:19:27,362
Which means she used a
$60 million government warplane

453
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,963
as her personal getaway vehicle.

454
00:19:29,032 --> 00:19:30,431
It appears so.

455
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,701
Is this connected in any way
to the murdered petty officer

456
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:34,770
from the ship?

457
00:19:34,838 --> 00:19:36,504
She's our number-one
suspect, ma'am.

458
00:19:36,573 --> 00:19:38,373
Well, it's one big damn mess.

459
00:19:38,441 --> 00:19:41,376
And we'll clean it up, ma'am.
Our people are closing in.

460
00:19:41,444 --> 00:19:43,378
I should have her
in custody very soon.

461
00:19:44,547 --> 00:19:47,015
Call me the minute you do.
Will do.

462
00:19:48,551 --> 00:19:49,984
I like your
confidence, Leon.

463
00:19:50,053 --> 00:19:53,121
Fake it till you make it, Jack.
What do you got?

464
00:19:53,189 --> 00:19:56,190
The lieutenant's file. I think
I know where she's going next.

465
00:19:56,259 --> 00:19:57,525
Bring it.

466
00:19:57,594 --> 00:20:00,995
She needs an ally, right?
Someone she can trust.

467
00:20:01,064 --> 00:20:02,797
But she's from Tennessee,

468
00:20:02,866 --> 00:20:04,877
and she's trapped in the
Outer Banks of North Carolina.

469
00:20:04,901 --> 00:20:06,134
Right,

470
00:20:06,202 --> 00:20:08,302
but when she applied
for officer candidate school,

471
00:20:08,371 --> 00:20:11,205
she submitted a letter
of character from her godfather,

472
00:20:11,274 --> 00:20:14,375
a former Navy pilot himself.
And guess where he lives.

473
00:20:14,444 --> 00:20:17,311
The Outer Banks of
North Carolina. I'll call Gibbs.

474
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,480
I already did.

475
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:21,382
Well done, Jack.

476
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:39,400
Can I help you folks?
Where is she?

477
00:20:40,437 --> 00:20:43,171
Well, good afternoon
to you, too.

478
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:44,572
Not really.

479
00:20:44,641 --> 00:20:46,741
Maybe we should start
with introductions.

480
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:47,942
My name is Jack...

481
00:20:48,011 --> 00:20:50,011
Navy Lieutenant Commander
Jack Briggs,

482
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,345
retired.

483
00:20:51,414 --> 00:20:53,715
Special Agent Bishop,
this is Gibbs, McGee,

484
00:20:53,783 --> 00:20:55,383
and that is Torres.

485
00:20:55,452 --> 00:20:57,329
We have reason to believe
that your goddaughter,

486
00:20:57,353 --> 00:20:59,721
Lieutenant Rebecca Weeks,
is on your property.

487
00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:03,291
My, oh, my, you seem to
have brought the whole posse.

488
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,094
Well, you can search
the house, Th...

489
00:21:06,162 --> 00:21:09,297
there's fresh
lemonade in there.

490
00:21:09,365 --> 00:21:11,766
You can help yourself
to it if you've a mind.

491
00:21:11,835 --> 00:21:14,435
Commander Briggs.
Is she here or not?

492
00:21:14,504 --> 00:21:17,472
She was here.
Now she's gone.

493
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,973
Where?

494
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:22,777
I didn't ask.
And she didn't say.

495
00:21:22,846 --> 00:21:24,545
Well, she's not
gonna get far.

496
00:21:24,614 --> 00:21:26,247
Every road off this island

497
00:21:26,316 --> 00:21:27,482
is blocked.

498
00:21:28,551 --> 00:21:29,784
TORRES:
Hey, Gibbs?

499
00:21:29,853 --> 00:21:31,052
She's still here.

500
00:21:33,022 --> 00:21:35,389
You're not gonna
catch her, you know.

501
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,158
She's way too smart.

502
00:21:38,995 --> 00:21:40,495
Check the house.

503
00:21:42,198 --> 00:21:44,499
You know lying to federal agents
is a crime?

504
00:21:44,567 --> 00:21:47,835
Well, son, I'll tell you,
I don't give a hot damn.

505
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:50,304
She's innocent. She didn't
kill her boyfriend.

506
00:21:50,373 --> 00:21:53,241
And if you want to arrest me...

507
00:21:53,309 --> 00:21:54,375
then arrest me.

508
00:21:57,013 --> 00:21:58,913
(chuckles)
Great.

509
00:21:58,982 --> 00:22:01,349
I didn't have much else
to do today.

510
00:22:01,417 --> 00:22:02,417
Put him in the car.

511
00:22:04,154 --> 00:22:05,419
(engine starting)

512
00:22:05,488 --> 00:22:07,522
Uh, what is that?

513
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:10,625
(engine humming) That is why Rebecca
came here today.

514
00:22:10,693 --> 00:22:12,160
Stay with him.

515
00:22:39,867 --> 00:22:42,198
Yes, Madam Secretary,
we thought

516
00:22:42,199 --> 00:22:44,666
we had her surrounded.
Uh, she...

517
00:22:45,969 --> 00:22:48,069
Have we found the plane yet?

518
00:22:48,138 --> 00:22:50,272
Uh, not yet.
But, uh, she didn't exactly

519
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,007
leave a flight plan, so...

520
00:22:52,075 --> 00:22:55,810
You have a nice day, too.

521
00:22:55,879 --> 00:22:58,947
She didn't really say
"Have a nice day," did she?

522
00:22:59,016 --> 00:23:00,949
So where's our pilot,
Agent McGee?

523
00:23:01,018 --> 00:23:02,584
And please don't say
you don't know.

524
00:23:02,653 --> 00:23:05,587
Well, what we do know
is the maximum range

525
00:23:05,656 --> 00:23:08,623
of the aircraft, given a
full tank, is about 700 miles.

526
00:23:08,692 --> 00:23:11,426
So we're talking anywhere
from east of the Mississippi

527
00:23:11,495 --> 00:23:12,928
to where she grew up
in Tennessee?

528
00:23:12,996 --> 00:23:16,298
Yeah. We've notified
the FAA, put a BOLO out

529
00:23:16,366 --> 00:23:17,766
at all the private airfields,

530
00:23:17,834 --> 00:23:19,801
so when the plane
lands, we will know.

531
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,937
And her godfather isn't talking?

532
00:23:22,005 --> 00:23:23,972
Well, Gibbs and Bishop
decided to stay back

533
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:26,107
in North Carolina,
see what he has to say,

534
00:23:26,176 --> 00:23:28,443
but so far he just keeps saying
she's innocent.

535
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,378
Oh, innocent people
don't steal motorcycles

536
00:23:30,447 --> 00:23:31,780
and commandeer planes.

537
00:23:31,848 --> 00:23:33,481
If she didn't
kill her boyfriend,

538
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,116
why is she running?

539
00:23:35,185 --> 00:23:38,453
Yeah. All right,
is that it, Director?

540
00:23:39,523 --> 00:23:40,855
No.

541
00:23:40,924 --> 00:23:42,757
Please close the door.

542
00:23:50,033 --> 00:23:53,802
Agent McGee, um,
have you...

543
00:23:55,872 --> 00:23:58,506
Have you been discussing

544
00:23:58,575 --> 00:24:01,609
your private
medical decisions at work?

545
00:24:02,646 --> 00:24:04,846
W... Uh... once.

546
00:24:04,915 --> 00:24:06,581
I brought it up.

547
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:10,151
It was actually more
like three times. Um...

548
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,887
counting now.
This-This is the fifth time.

549
00:24:12,956 --> 00:24:14,756
Please don't bring it up again.

550
00:24:14,825 --> 00:24:18,159
Understood. Sorry.

551
00:24:18,228 --> 00:24:21,096
It's just, um...

552
00:24:23,066 --> 00:24:25,200
(chuckling): No...
(mutters)

553
00:24:25,268 --> 00:24:26,901
Agent McGee?

554
00:24:28,939 --> 00:24:30,405
You're gonna be fine.

555
00:24:30,474 --> 00:24:32,340
A little discomfort

556
00:24:32,409 --> 00:24:35,243
for a few days, but then
you'll be back in the saddle.

557
00:24:35,312 --> 00:24:37,612
Wait, you...

558
00:24:37,681 --> 00:24:39,014
Mm-hmm.

559
00:24:39,082 --> 00:24:41,282
Oh, my God, that is
such a relief to hear.

560
00:24:41,351 --> 00:24:43,051
Wow, did-did you do

561
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,387
the, the non-scalpel method
or-or with the scalpel?

562
00:24:45,455 --> 00:24:48,957
Both.
W... Y... Why'd you do it twice?

563
00:24:50,193 --> 00:24:52,394
My boys went down swinging.

564
00:24:52,645 --> 00:24:56,380
Oh, my. Wow, how'd you find out
it didn't work the first time?

565
00:24:56,449 --> 00:24:58,983
When Jackie got pregnant
with our son.

566
00:24:59,052 --> 00:25:01,652
Jared was an oops?
Yep.

567
00:25:01,721 --> 00:25:03,454
Best mistake we ever made.

568
00:25:06,693 --> 00:25:07,625
We found the plane.

569
00:25:07,694 --> 00:25:08,926
Where?
In Tennessee?

570
00:25:08,995 --> 00:25:11,629
Not even close.

571
00:25:11,698 --> 00:25:13,064
Fairfield, North Carolina,

572
00:25:13,132 --> 00:25:15,177
and she landed on a small
airstrip about an hour ago.

573
00:25:15,201 --> 00:25:16,300
Any sign of the lieutenant?

574
00:25:16,369 --> 00:25:18,002
A mechanic saw her land,

575
00:25:18,071 --> 00:25:20,605
but by the time he saw our
BOLO, she was long gone.

576
00:25:20,673 --> 00:25:22,106
All right, uh,
Fairfield--

577
00:25:22,175 --> 00:25:23,941
we can be there
in about an hour.

578
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,676
I'll tell the mechanic
you're on your way.

579
00:25:27,213 --> 00:25:29,146
So, she had a plane.

580
00:25:29,215 --> 00:25:30,648
She could have flown anywhere.

581
00:25:30,717 --> 00:25:32,250
Why a tiny town

582
00:25:32,318 --> 00:25:34,986
30 miles away
from where she took off?

583
00:25:35,054 --> 00:25:37,121
(phone rings)

584
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:39,523
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

585
00:25:39,592 --> 00:25:41,626
Hello?

586
00:25:41,694 --> 00:25:42,927
WEEKS:
Is this the agent

587
00:25:42,996 --> 00:25:45,930
I saw at my godfather's house?

588
00:25:47,734 --> 00:25:49,000
Weeks?

589
00:25:49,068 --> 00:25:50,534
Yeah.

590
00:25:52,338 --> 00:25:53,738
Thanks for not shooting me.

591
00:25:56,142 --> 00:25:58,209
I probably would've missed.

592
00:25:58,278 --> 00:26:00,177
How'd you get this number?

593
00:26:00,246 --> 00:26:02,546
I called your office.
They transferred me.

594
00:26:02,615 --> 00:26:04,982
I didn't kill Fisher.

595
00:26:05,051 --> 00:26:06,817
GIBBS:
Uh, okay.

596
00:26:06,886 --> 00:26:09,153
Tell me what happened.

597
00:26:09,222 --> 00:26:11,355
I got a couple things
to do first.

598
00:26:11,424 --> 00:26:13,624
In Fairfield?

599
00:26:13,693 --> 00:26:15,059
You found the plane.

600
00:26:16,296 --> 00:26:18,896
Well, you knew we would.

601
00:26:18,965 --> 00:26:20,431
What are you doing in Fairfield?

602
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,099
Your job.

603
00:26:23,736 --> 00:26:25,736
Yeah?
What job is that?

604
00:26:29,575 --> 00:26:31,008
Weeks?

605
00:26:31,077 --> 00:26:33,511
(sighs)
Hello. Weeks, you still here?

606
00:26:33,579 --> 00:26:36,080
Nah, she ended the call
before we could trace it.

607
00:26:37,383 --> 00:26:38,983
No, line's still open.
She never hung up.

608
00:26:41,921 --> 00:26:44,822
She wants us to trace the call.

609
00:26:44,891 --> 00:26:48,526
So I come back from dinner,
I find my front door

610
00:26:48,594 --> 00:26:50,194
bashed open,

611
00:26:50,263 --> 00:26:52,163
and my paperwork
all over the place.

612
00:26:52,231 --> 00:26:54,498
She didn't find
the cashbox,

613
00:26:54,567 --> 00:26:57,335
but she did find these keys
and took one.

614
00:26:57,403 --> 00:26:58,703
And she walked out the door.

615
00:26:58,771 --> 00:27:02,239
You want to see the
rest, uh, be my guest.

616
00:27:02,308 --> 00:27:04,342
Here.

617
00:27:05,478 --> 00:27:07,211
All right.
There she goes.

618
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,115
She gets into that car.
Puts it in reverse,

619
00:27:11,184 --> 00:27:13,017
and backs right into
my tow truck.

620
00:27:13,086 --> 00:27:14,518
Thanks very much, lady.

621
00:27:14,587 --> 00:27:16,187
Then she puts
it in drive,

622
00:27:16,255 --> 00:27:17,955
guns the engine,

623
00:27:18,024 --> 00:27:20,424
and crashes right
through my front gate.

624
00:27:20,493 --> 00:27:22,760
This kind of crap
is why I left New Jersey.

625
00:27:22,829 --> 00:27:24,562
Who's car was that?

626
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,297
Some guy with
too many parking tickets.

627
00:27:26,366 --> 00:27:27,565
I impounded it yesterday.

628
00:27:27,633 --> 00:27:30,267
Okay, I don't get it.

629
00:27:30,336 --> 00:27:33,070
She trades in her plane
for a car

630
00:27:33,139 --> 00:27:35,039
that she breaks into
a junkyard to steal,

631
00:27:35,108 --> 00:27:38,175
and then she leads us here?

632
00:27:38,244 --> 00:27:39,521
Hey, I-I didn't
touch that phone,

633
00:27:39,545 --> 00:27:41,323
if you're gonna dust for
fingerprints or something.

634
00:27:41,347 --> 00:27:43,547
Oh, no, thank you.
We-we already know who it is.

635
00:27:43,616 --> 00:27:44,949
You do?
Mm.

636
00:27:45,017 --> 00:27:46,884
Oh, you guys are good.

637
00:27:46,953 --> 00:27:49,053
Hey, tell her
to bring back that car.

638
00:27:49,122 --> 00:27:50,588
It's not about the Subaru.

639
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:54,492
Rewind the video. Find out what
else she did while she was here.

640
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,994
What? Breaking and entering
is not enough for you two?

641
00:27:57,063 --> 00:27:59,063
Right there.
Play it.

642
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:02,266
What's she doing?

643
00:28:02,335 --> 00:28:04,268
She's taking

644
00:28:04,337 --> 00:28:06,203
something from under the hood.

645
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,173
I can't make out
what it is.

646
00:28:09,242 --> 00:28:10,841
Whose car is that?

647
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:13,477
I don't know.
She stole the paperwork.

648
00:28:13,546 --> 00:28:14,578
Well, try
to remember.

649
00:28:15,681 --> 00:28:16,981
That's a junker.

650
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:18,315
Brought it in last month.

651
00:28:18,384 --> 00:28:21,085
Some driver wrapped it
around a tree. It's worthless.

652
00:28:21,154 --> 00:28:23,187
Not worthless to her.

653
00:28:23,256 --> 00:28:24,789
Hey. Are you guys
hearing me?

654
00:28:24,857 --> 00:28:28,025
I really don't care
about that piece of junk.

655
00:28:28,094 --> 00:28:30,494
What about the Subaru
that she drove off in?

656
00:28:30,563 --> 00:28:31,962
And the hole
in my gate?

657
00:28:32,031 --> 00:28:33,964
And what about the dent
in my tow truck?

658
00:28:34,033 --> 00:28:36,467
Get that car
back to NCIS.

659
00:28:36,536 --> 00:28:38,302
Find out what she took and why.

660
00:28:38,371 --> 00:28:41,539
Gladly, all we need's
a tow truck.

661
00:28:41,607 --> 00:28:44,041
You got to be
kidding me, right?

662
00:28:51,017 --> 00:28:52,650
Kasie?

663
00:28:52,718 --> 00:28:54,051
KASIE:
Under here.

664
00:28:58,791 --> 00:29:00,191
You find out what the pilot...

665
00:29:00,259 --> 00:29:01,725
Damn, what happened here?

666
00:29:01,794 --> 00:29:03,527
This is what happens
to a junkyard car.

667
00:29:03,596 --> 00:29:05,629
It's raided for parts.

668
00:29:05,698 --> 00:29:08,833
But what part did Weeks
actually steal?

669
00:29:08,901 --> 00:29:10,067
Exactly.

670
00:29:10,136 --> 00:29:12,703
But... I have persevered,

671
00:29:12,772 --> 00:29:15,139
and watched that surveillance
video 47 times,

672
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:18,042
and I think I figured it out.

673
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,877
She took the engine
control system.

674
00:29:19,946 --> 00:29:21,745
All right, pretend I
don't know what that is.

675
00:29:21,814 --> 00:29:22,913
Thought you were
a gearhead.

676
00:29:22,982 --> 00:29:25,149
Classic cars only.
Ah.

677
00:29:25,218 --> 00:29:28,018
Well, the ECS is the car's
onboard computer system.

678
00:29:28,087 --> 00:29:29,367
It allows its
various electronics

679
00:29:29,422 --> 00:29:30,654
to talk to each other.

680
00:29:30,723 --> 00:29:32,890
All right, but why would
a killer break into a junkyard

681
00:29:32,959 --> 00:29:34,892
to steal that?

682
00:29:34,961 --> 00:29:37,995
I don't know. But I know why
she was interested in this car.

683
00:29:38,064 --> 00:29:39,096
You ran the VIN number?

684
00:29:39,165 --> 00:29:41,665
I did. The last owner
was a Navy commander

685
00:29:41,734 --> 00:29:44,568
named Marshall May.

686
00:29:44,637 --> 00:29:45,836
That's Weeks' CO.

687
00:29:45,905 --> 00:29:47,204
The one and only.

688
00:29:47,273 --> 00:29:49,840
Well, he got into a terrible wreck.
Uh, wasn't him.

689
00:29:49,909 --> 00:29:51,820
He was deployed at the time
at the time of the accident.

690
00:29:51,844 --> 00:29:54,044
His wife Jill was driving.

691
00:29:54,113 --> 00:29:55,113
Is she okay?

692
00:29:55,181 --> 00:29:56,680
No. She died.

693
00:29:58,484 --> 00:30:01,952
McGEE: Oh, this is making
my head hurt. Okay.

694
00:30:02,021 --> 00:30:05,523
Why is Weeks digging into
her CO's wife's death?

695
00:30:05,591 --> 00:30:07,758
Well, when she called Gibbs

696
00:30:07,827 --> 00:30:09,226
and said she was
doing our job,

697
00:30:09,295 --> 00:30:11,729
maybe this is the job
she was talking about.

698
00:30:11,797 --> 00:30:13,097
Job's already done, though.

699
00:30:13,165 --> 00:30:15,065
We have a police report
in here that says

700
00:30:15,134 --> 00:30:16,767
the car crash
was an accident.

701
00:30:16,836 --> 00:30:18,369
Maybe Weeks doesn't agree.

702
00:30:18,437 --> 00:30:21,305
What is she doing, conducting
her own investigation?

703
00:30:21,374 --> 00:30:23,774
While she's already
on the run for murder?

704
00:30:23,843 --> 00:30:25,142
Well, what's
to investigate?

705
00:30:25,211 --> 00:30:27,978
"Driver lost control of
vehicle and sideswiped a tree,

706
00:30:28,047 --> 00:30:30,214
killing her instantly."

707
00:30:30,283 --> 00:30:33,117
It says it was
a one-car accident.

708
00:30:33,185 --> 00:30:35,786
That thing that Weeks
took from the car.

709
00:30:35,855 --> 00:30:37,922
The engine control system.
Yeah, wha-what

710
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,423
does that do, McGee?
Well, the ECS

711
00:30:39,492 --> 00:30:40,958
is the brains of the vehicle.

712
00:30:41,027 --> 00:30:43,093
It controls
everything electronic,

713
00:30:43,162 --> 00:30:46,163
the air conditioning,
radio, power steering.

714
00:30:46,232 --> 00:30:47,464
Power steering.

715
00:30:47,533 --> 00:30:49,099
What about the brakes?

716
00:30:49,168 --> 00:30:50,634
Sure. Why?

717
00:30:50,703 --> 00:30:54,171
In the police report,
it says there was no skid marks.

718
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,640
What are you thinking,
the ECS failed?

719
00:30:56,709 --> 00:30:58,509
Or someone made it fail.

720
00:30:58,578 --> 00:31:01,178
The ECS is a computer,
and computers can be hacked.

721
00:31:01,247 --> 00:31:02,813
So I saw
this thing

722
00:31:02,882 --> 00:31:05,583
online last week
where two high school students

723
00:31:05,651 --> 00:31:07,318
hacked their
principal's car

724
00:31:07,386 --> 00:31:09,086
and drove it onto
the football field.

725
00:31:09,155 --> 00:31:11,622
Maybe Weeks thinks the
commander's car got hacked.

726
00:31:11,691 --> 00:31:13,524
She took the ECS to prove it.

727
00:31:13,593 --> 00:31:16,126
Uh, uh, this
is all speculation.

728
00:31:16,195 --> 00:31:18,529
And let's not forget
we're talking about a woman

729
00:31:18,598 --> 00:31:19,598
who killed her boyfriend,

730
00:31:19,665 --> 00:31:21,131
crashed a plane

731
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,311
and then faked her own death.

732
00:31:22,335 --> 00:31:23,500
Let's go get her.

733
00:31:23,569 --> 00:31:24,635
Got a hit on the Subaru

734
00:31:24,704 --> 00:31:26,670
she stole from the junkyard.

735
00:31:26,739 --> 00:31:27,838
Where's it at, boss?

736
00:31:27,907 --> 00:31:30,140
Norfolk.
Pier 90.

737
00:31:30,209 --> 00:31:32,309
Wha... That's where the
aircraft carrier's docked.

738
00:31:32,378 --> 00:31:35,145
Why would a killer return
to the scene of the crime?

739
00:31:35,214 --> 00:31:36,981
Maybe she's not done killing.

740
00:31:37,049 --> 00:31:38,329
GIBBS:
McGee, notify the captain.

741
00:31:38,384 --> 00:31:40,384
Warn him about Weeks.

742
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:48,538
CAPTAIN:
<i>Agent Gibbs.</i>

743
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,672
Captain.
Any sign of Lieutenant Weeks?

744
00:31:50,741 --> 00:31:52,541
No. Thank you
for the warning,

745
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,221
but we don't believe
she boarded. This way.

746
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,856
TORRES: She could have boarded
before we called you.

747
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,646
Unlikely.
Her ID was tagged.

748
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:59,214
We would have been notified.

749
00:31:59,283 --> 00:32:01,884
Well, we've discovered
she's quite resourceful.

750
00:32:01,952 --> 00:32:03,392
Which is why
we locked down the ship.

751
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:05,031
All sailors are confined
to their quarters.

752
00:32:05,055 --> 00:32:06,388
No one on or off.

753
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:08,156
Do you have that list
we requested?

754
00:32:08,225 --> 00:32:10,459
Yes.
Everyone who swiped

755
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:12,127
their ID in the past 12 hours.

756
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:14,029
Thanks.
(knocking)

757
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,430
CAPTAIN:
Commander May.

758
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:18,400
He knows we want to talk to him?

759
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:20,302
I told him myself.

760
00:32:22,606 --> 00:32:24,373
Commander May,
this is the captain.

761
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:37,853
Are you sure he was in here?

762
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:39,599
I just talked to him.
He was sitting right there,

763
00:32:39,623 --> 00:32:40,923
working on his laptop.

764
00:32:40,991 --> 00:32:42,391
Now they're both gone.

765
00:32:42,459 --> 00:32:43,703
Hey, Gibbs, take a look at this.

766
00:32:43,727 --> 00:32:45,427
So Petty Officer
Sandra Stevens

767
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:48,564
boarded right before the ship
was locked down.

768
00:32:48,632 --> 00:32:50,165
I'm calling him.

769
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:52,114
She looks a lot like Weeks.
Which got me curious

770
00:32:52,169 --> 00:32:54,069
enough to look her up.

771
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:57,906
According to Stevens' ESR, she's
on medical leave in San Diego.

772
00:32:57,975 --> 00:32:59,508
McGEE:
Weeks posed as Stevens.

773
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:00,909
She's on board.

774
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:02,878
Call went straight
to voice mail.

775
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:05,581
We can find them. Officers can
search every compartment.

776
00:33:05,649 --> 00:33:07,249
We don't have that kind of time.

777
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,184
His laptop-- can you trace it?

778
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:12,254
The ship's Wi-Fi was shut down.
We need 20 minutes to reboot.

779
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,422
I know another way.

780
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,391
But it'll take an
electromagnetic sensor

781
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,671
configured to look
for a Bluetooth signal.

782
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:19,261
Do it.
Yep.

783
00:33:21,098 --> 00:33:22,842
WEEKS: Come on, Commander.
We're running out of time.

784
00:33:22,866 --> 00:33:24,933
MAY:
Weeks, please.

785
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:29,538
Weeks.

786
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:31,473
Hi, Agent Gibbs.

787
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:33,775
Don't do it.

788
00:33:33,844 --> 00:33:35,110
You're early.

789
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,979
I don't have his password yet.

790
00:33:40,217 --> 00:33:42,951
Lieutenant.
I need you to drop your weapon.

791
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,554
Not until I have his password.

792
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,291
Here's the engine control
system.

793
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,126
It proves that his
wife's car was hacked.

794
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,929
Now all I need is his password
to prove that he did it.

795
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:55,163
How dare you say that?

796
00:33:55,232 --> 00:33:56,331
Jill had an accident.

797
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,000
Then give me your damn password.

798
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:01,903
Get back.

799
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:06,141
Don't come any closer.

800
00:34:11,715 --> 00:34:13,982
I am putting my weapon down,
Lieutenant.

801
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:16,585
Gibbs.

802
00:34:18,555 --> 00:34:20,922
It's okay, McGee.

803
00:34:20,991 --> 00:34:23,392
It is okay.

804
00:34:25,162 --> 00:34:27,429
Got a predicament, Lieutenant.

805
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:29,531
You shoot me,

806
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,968
Agent McGee shoots you,

807
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:36,204
neither one of us are gonna know
what's on that laptop.

808
00:34:39,852 --> 00:34:41,852
It's your choice.

809
00:35:01,206 --> 00:35:02,739
MAY:
<i>She's lost it.</i>

810
00:35:02,808 --> 00:35:04,741
She's a lunatic.
You saw her.

811
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:07,077
I thought you said she
was your best pilot.

812
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,979
And a family friend.

813
00:35:09,048 --> 00:35:10,625
That was before she aimed
a gun at my head

814
00:35:10,649 --> 00:35:12,582
and accused me of murder.

815
00:35:12,651 --> 00:35:14,017
WEEKS:
Agent Gibbs,

816
00:35:14,086 --> 00:35:16,486
did you check
the commander's laptop?

817
00:35:18,891 --> 00:35:20,424
We're looking into it.

818
00:35:20,492 --> 00:35:23,260
He killed his wife.

819
00:35:23,328 --> 00:35:26,430
He took control of her car
and he crashed it.

820
00:35:26,498 --> 00:35:29,533
MAY:
<i>No. That's crazy.</i>

821
00:35:29,601 --> 00:35:32,402
Losing my wife
was the hardest thing

822
00:35:32,471 --> 00:35:34,004
I've had to live through.

823
00:35:34,073 --> 00:35:37,541
I did not kill her.

824
00:35:37,609 --> 00:35:39,843
Your laptop did.

825
00:35:39,912 --> 00:35:43,046
We tested it. You used it
to hack into your wife's car.

826
00:35:43,115 --> 00:35:44,581
No.
Yes.

827
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:46,890
You disabled the brakes, you
took control of the steering

828
00:35:46,919 --> 00:35:48,285
and drove her
into a tree.

829
00:35:48,353 --> 00:35:49,719
Why would I ever do that?

830
00:35:49,788 --> 00:35:52,756
They were having
marital problems. Big ones.

831
00:35:52,825 --> 00:35:54,758
Jill told me
so herself.

832
00:35:54,827 --> 00:35:57,094
We became friends
through the commander,

833
00:35:57,162 --> 00:36:00,097
and last month at dinner,
she confided in me that...

834
00:36:00,165 --> 00:36:03,733
he had been acting weird

835
00:36:03,802 --> 00:36:04,901
toward her.

836
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:06,303
She said,

837
00:36:06,371 --> 00:36:09,172
"If I wind up dead,
my husband did it."

838
00:36:11,009 --> 00:36:13,210
And I thought she was joking.

839
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,480
Until she ended up dead.

840
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:21,251
Why didn't you contact NCIS?

841
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,087
And accuse my CO of murder?

842
00:36:24,156 --> 00:36:26,923
He was on the ship
when she crashed.

843
00:36:26,992 --> 00:36:30,293
I thought it was
just an eerie coincidence.

844
00:36:30,362 --> 00:36:32,662
But then, the other night
on social media, I saw

845
00:36:32,731 --> 00:36:35,765
a group of high school kids
hacked their principal's car.

846
00:36:35,834 --> 00:36:37,834
I asked Fisher.

847
00:36:37,903 --> 00:36:40,570
Could the commander
have done something like that?

848
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,740
He said he'd call NCIS.

849
00:36:43,809 --> 00:36:46,409
TORRES: <i>You found out that Petty</i>
<i>Officer Patrick was gonna</i>

850
00:36:46,478 --> 00:36:48,278
report you to NCIS.

851
00:36:48,347 --> 00:36:50,447
So you had to kill him, too.

852
00:36:50,516 --> 00:36:53,917
No.
I didn't kill anyone.

853
00:36:53,986 --> 00:36:56,319
You knew Weeks was
prescribed oxycodone

854
00:36:56,388 --> 00:36:58,021
and kept it in her lockbox.

855
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,490
And as CO,
you had the combination.

856
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:01,958
This is insane.

857
00:37:02,027 --> 00:37:03,760
I never even met
the petty officer.

858
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:06,496
The first time I ever saw him
was dead in Weeks' bunk.

859
00:37:06,565 --> 00:37:08,465
I found him in my bunk

860
00:37:08,534 --> 00:37:10,967
and I freaked out.

861
00:37:11,036 --> 00:37:13,870
I couldn't think,
I just...

862
00:37:13,939 --> 00:37:17,507
I got in the cockpit
and I took off.

863
00:37:17,576 --> 00:37:20,177
I was convinced that when
I landed back on the ship,

864
00:37:20,245 --> 00:37:23,146
I'd be arrested or killed.

865
00:37:23,215 --> 00:37:26,850
So you ditched the airplane.

866
00:37:26,919 --> 00:37:29,920
At that point,
I couldn't call NCIS.

867
00:37:31,557 --> 00:37:34,691
Not until I proved my theory.

868
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,693
So I found Jill's car,

869
00:37:36,762 --> 00:37:39,196
I took her engine control
system, I tested it,

870
00:37:39,264 --> 00:37:41,031
and it was hacked.

871
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:44,334
And the hack traced back
to the ship's IP address.

872
00:37:44,403 --> 00:37:46,069
The commander.

873
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:48,505
I loved my wife.

874
00:37:48,574 --> 00:37:51,408
Sure, we were having problems,
but I would never...

875
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,413
Oh, my God.

876
00:37:56,481 --> 00:37:59,316
Something you want to share?

877
00:37:59,384 --> 00:38:01,651
Oh... oh, my God.

878
00:38:03,055 --> 00:38:05,188
Commander.

879
00:38:05,257 --> 00:38:07,824
She used my computer.

880
00:38:07,893 --> 00:38:11,228
And she knows Weeks'
lockbox combo.

881
00:38:12,564 --> 00:38:14,598
Who is she?

882
00:38:17,302 --> 00:38:18,602
Agent Bishop.

883
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,103
Am I interrupting?

884
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:22,005
Just work.
Come in.

885
00:38:22,074 --> 00:38:23,840
Of course.

886
00:38:23,909 --> 00:38:26,676
You're a weapons
systems officer.

887
00:38:26,745 --> 00:38:28,678
You can work
from anywhere.

888
00:38:28,747 --> 00:38:32,415
All you need is a laptop
and an Internet connection.

889
00:38:32,484 --> 00:38:35,185
Yeah, I guess.
Oh,

890
00:38:35,254 --> 00:38:38,021
don't be modest. I mean,
you program high tech avionics.

891
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:41,625
Compared to that, the engine
control system on cars

892
00:38:41,693 --> 00:38:45,195
must be pretty easy
to hack into.

893
00:38:45,264 --> 00:38:47,197
Silence is a good plan.

894
00:38:47,266 --> 00:38:50,133
We'll let your love texts
do all the talking.

895
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:52,135
"I don't want to
share you anymore."

896
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:55,238
'When are you ending
it with her?"

897
00:38:55,307 --> 00:38:56,706
You tried to cover your tracks

898
00:38:56,775 --> 00:38:59,109
by using a self-destructing
messaging app,

899
00:38:59,177 --> 00:39:01,177
but the commander saved a few.

900
00:39:02,814 --> 00:39:05,148
You know, he kept promising
he was gonna leave her.

901
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:07,450
They never do.

902
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:10,287
But he loves me.

903
00:39:10,355 --> 00:39:12,122
He wants me.

904
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:14,257
Not after he figured
out that you used

905
00:39:14,326 --> 00:39:16,259
his laptop to hack
into his wife's car

906
00:39:16,328 --> 00:39:18,295
and drive it into a tree.

907
00:39:20,365 --> 00:39:21,464
Captain?

908
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:24,601
I did this so that
we could be together.

909
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,102
And you were,

910
00:39:26,171 --> 00:39:29,339
until your bunkmate Weeks
got suspicious,

911
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:31,408
starting talking
to her boyfriend about it.

912
00:39:33,078 --> 00:39:35,245
So you poisoned him
and you framed her.

913
00:39:48,694 --> 00:39:50,327
Up here.

914
00:39:53,899 --> 00:39:56,132
Boss, someone here to see you.

915
00:39:56,201 --> 00:39:57,767
Lieutenant Weeks.

916
00:39:57,836 --> 00:39:58,968
WEEKS:
Agent Gibbs.

917
00:39:59,037 --> 00:40:01,304
I'm heading to my court-martial.

918
00:40:01,373 --> 00:40:02,706
I wanted to say thank you

919
00:40:02,774 --> 00:40:05,442
for offering to testify
on my behalf.

920
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:07,143
Hope it helps.

921
00:40:07,212 --> 00:40:10,113
Anything helps explain why
I dumped a government warplane

922
00:40:10,182 --> 00:40:11,715
into the ocean.

923
00:40:11,783 --> 00:40:14,417
I don't think "I'm sorry"
is going to cut it.

924
00:40:15,954 --> 00:40:18,455
All you can do is go in there
and tell the truth.

925
00:40:18,523 --> 00:40:21,358
Thank you.
I will.

926
00:40:22,427 --> 00:40:23,960
Hey, Weeks?

927
00:40:25,731 --> 00:40:28,398
Thanks for not shooting me.

928
00:40:29,568 --> 00:40:31,534
I probably would have missed.

929
00:40:42,981 --> 00:40:46,383
10:00, McGee.
Don't you have someplace to be?

930
00:40:47,419 --> 00:40:49,119
Boss, you know about that?

931
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:52,288
Hell, everybody
knows about that.

932
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:55,291
Well, then, I guess I better go.

933
00:40:57,129 --> 00:40:59,662
If I could, uh,
just get my feet to move.

934
00:40:59,731 --> 00:41:00,930
(chuckles)

935
00:41:01,967 --> 00:41:03,633
What are you worried about?

936
00:41:04,669 --> 00:41:07,737
Well, just...

937
00:41:07,806 --> 00:41:10,440
I don't know.
What if something goes wrong?

938
00:41:11,676 --> 00:41:13,243
No, Tim.

939
00:41:13,311 --> 00:41:16,012
What are you worried about?

940
00:41:16,081 --> 00:41:17,847
Come on, boss.
What are you, Sloane now?

941
00:41:17,916 --> 00:41:19,449
(chuckles)

942
00:41:23,688 --> 00:41:25,355
I just...

943
00:41:25,424 --> 00:41:28,691
What if life
throws me a curveball?

944
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,293
You know?

945
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:34,130
I think you know more than
anyone what I'm talking about.

946
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:37,100
I just... I don't want
to make a decision

947
00:41:37,169 --> 00:41:39,302
that I'm gonna regret
down the road.

948
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:42,305
You made a decision today.

949
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:44,707
Don't worry about tomorrow.

950
00:41:46,778 --> 00:41:49,112
It's easier to get past
than you think.

951
00:41:51,116 --> 00:41:53,316
Trust me.

952
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:56,553
Wait, boss, you're a member
of the cut club?

953
00:41:56,621 --> 00:41:58,388
Oh, hell no.

954
00:41:58,457 --> 00:42:00,457
I wish you luck, though.

955

1
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,811
<i>At that time...</i>

2
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,690
<i>I did not know what
they could do to us</i>

3
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,194
<i>or what we were capable of.</i>

4
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,961
<i>I had my brothers, and a family,</i>

5
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:12,466
<i>but I had not yet met
my sisters in arms.</i>

6
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,434
<i>I still can not believe</i>

7
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,937
<i>how fragile our happiness was</i>

8
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:29,983
<i>and how much this war
was about to change me.</i>

9
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,158
Keiro!

10
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,037
<i>It all began that morning...</i>

11
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,415
Hello.

12
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:55,050
Forget it.
Yazidi girls only marry Yazidis.

13
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:57,469
Go.

14
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,596
<i>Since the attack on Mosul,</i>

15
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:02,641
<i>soldiers were watching over our village.</i>

16
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,394
<i>They were only a few</i>

17
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:08,522
<i>and not prepared
for what was coming.</i>

18
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,200
Thank you dad!

19
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,537
- How did you get it?
- In English, darling.

20
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,956
How do you expect
to find work in the USA

21
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,557
if you don't practice your English?

22
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,170
It must have been very expensive.

23
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:33,755
Don't you worry about that.

24
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:42,306
<i>I was so exited to finish my painting...</i>

25
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,935
<i>I did not see how
worried my father was...</i>

26
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,690
<i>or the soldiers leaving.</i>

27
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,283
<i>I was just hearing my mother</i>

28
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,202
<i>singing her favorite song.</i>

29
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:05,795
It's beautiful!

30
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:07,781
Thank you.

31
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,011
Do you know who it is?

32
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,132
That's Malek Taous,
God's favorite angel.

33
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:20,052
And... why is it
his favorite angel?

34
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,388
Because he worships God

35
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:24,681
and only God.

36
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,725
I knew it!

37
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,185
It's not true.

38
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:30,187
I swear Juror, it's true!

39
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:33,565
Let's go.

40
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,046
Hold on.

41
00:04:35,071 --> 00:04:36,557
Yes.

42
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,613
Our religion forbids
us to spit on the ground.

43
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,823
I didn't really spit.

44
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:45,827
Keiro, it's even worse to lie.

45
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:47,204
- You understand?
- Yes.

46
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,292
There coming!

47
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:00,926
Quick, go upstairs!

48
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,825
Devil worshipers!

49
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,454
In his mercy,

50
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,164
the army of God,

51
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,249
Praise be to Almighty God...

52
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,257
gives you the chance

53
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,634
to redeem your apostasy.

54
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,554
Lay down your arms,

55
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,266
give your valuables

56
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,561
and nothing will happen to you.

57
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:45,614
They want the money.

58
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,240
Give it away, they will leave!

59
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:48,992
Especially not, they lie!

60
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,456
Don't do that.

61
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:12,641
I am Sunni! Sunni!

62
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:14,893
The devil is here!

63
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:50,803
Put it here!

64
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,855
Only men,

65
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,106
not women.

66
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:08,864
Where are you taking them?

67
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,408
Don't talk to Abu Mariam!

68
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:12,992
Dad!

69
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,938
We also take the old?

70
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,982
Yes, but on another bus.

71
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,483
Not with the fresh ones.

72
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:20,310
Devil worshipers,
convert to the true God.

73
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,562
Praise be to God.

74
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,522
Praise be to God!

75
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,151
Who are you to force us?

76
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:29,486
Your book says:

77
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:31,696
"No compulsion in religion."

78
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,917
Who are you to talk about the holy book?

79
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,963
You don't even have one!

80
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,014
So what?

81
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,058
Where's my yazidie?

82
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,560
I wish I could buy one

83
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:26,936
with blue eyes,

84
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,606
or two with brown eyes!

85
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,128
Don't move!

86
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,548
Please, not a woman.

87
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,634
Let a man kill me!

88
00:11:58,343 --> 00:11:59,344
Girls,

89
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:01,304
you see a man out here?

90
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,810
There is no men here.

91
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,521
They attacked all of our villages.

92
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,690
I saw lots of girls from school.

93
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:05,752
Age?

94
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,078
16 years old.

95
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:11,708
- Height? Weight?
- 1.70 M, 55 kg.

96
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,381
Age?

97
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,134
Height?

98
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:25,346
It's not your business!
Go to hell!

99
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,348
We're going to watch you!

100
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,101
Not in the face, you moron!
We have to sell her?

101
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,978
Do you know how much she is worth?

102
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,646
Take her for inspection!

103
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,191
By what right?

104
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,817
Holy war!

105
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,654
Age?

106
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,199
Height? Weight?

107
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,075
19 years old.

108
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:47,660
1.60 M.

109
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,620
Weight?

110
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,123
I don't know?

111
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,460
Virgin?

112
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,130
Is this your son?

113
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:08,514
Is this your mom?

114
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,600
No.

115
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,313
It's my sister.

116
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:40,462
Don't move!

117
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,069
Hello, Colonel Sharan.

118
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,236
Grégory Mendez.

119
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,573
Coalition office online.

120
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,039
Great shots.

121
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,293
Have they gone to the front yet?

122
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:01,668
Of course.

123
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,921
Jihadists men are terrified
when they see them.

124
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,088
Really?

125
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:08,426
They think that they
killed by a woman

126
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,845
keeps them from getting to Heaven.

127
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:14,515
and from getting virgins,
that come with it.

128
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:15,808
Fucking morons.

129
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,977
What would you do
when the war is over?

130
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,605
Will you live with the Arabs,
peacefully?

131
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:22,094
I mean...

132
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:24,707
you guy's didn't even managed
to do that between you Kurd's.

133
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:30,239
We dream of a Kurdistan that
respects every culture and religion.

134
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,742
- Do you really believe that yourself?
- Yes we do.

135
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:45,755
Who the spiders?

136
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:47,757
The Snake Brigade.

137
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,301
Special Forces.

138
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:51,468
How special?

139
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,305
Quite special indeed.

140
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:55,682
Can I interview them?

141
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:28,691
Hey don't use all the
water like last time!

142
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:31,110
It wasn't me,
it was already low when I got in!

143
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,487
Yeah right...

144
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:48,502
Have you showered?

145
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:49,962
Too hungry.

146
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,035
Bless Oh Lord this meal and
those who prepared it.

147
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:59,454
And give bread to those in need.
So be it. Amen.

148
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:03,359
What?

149
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,393
Nothing.

150
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,604
Eat! You said you were hungry.

151
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,194
The kitchen did a great job.

152
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:15,987
So finally!

153
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,115
You even found time
to put make-up on!

154
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,267
- Waterproof?
- Actually it is!

155
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:23,079
How do you say
"Yummy" in Kurdish?

156
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:24,455
Zero clue.

157
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,682
Come on you have a Kurdish father,
right?

158
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:29,710
Kurdish father,
English mum and I grew up in Zanzibar.

159
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,730
But why else would you think they
put me in the international brigade?

160
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:35,049
Chief how do you say
"Yummy" in Kurdish?

161
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,803
<i>God is dead.</i>

162
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:43,724
Whatever!

163
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:48,312
I heard you did well at the checkpoint.

164
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:49,814
No, there were too many of them.

165
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:52,358
But we managed to catch a
group that were lacking behind.

166
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:56,779
That's good. It will worry them.

167
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:05,179
You're alright?

168
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,747
It's just so hot.

169
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,166
It's even worse than back home.

170
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:13,170
Your the one who that should
have been born in England! Not me.

171
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:17,258
Hey come on,
let's clear our heads. We deserved it.

172
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:25,724
Welcome!

173
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:28,895
We were here before!

174
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,621
They are lieutenants of Abu Mariam.

175
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:55,004
This is our first choice.

176
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,806
She mutilated her face

177
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,725
but the rest...

178
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:09,309
is intact.

179
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:18,986
This one is very fresh.

180
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,988
Very, very fresh.

181
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,157
Look at her bright eyes.

182
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,410
And she has beautiful teeth.

183
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:27,870
Look.

184
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:30,789
Now I can see that.

185
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:37,171
But now I recognize her.

186
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,907
She was in the group
when we took Sinjar.

187
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,101
She must give us a good price.

188
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:52,687
Of course.

189
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:58,775
I'll take her.

190
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,038
Keiro!

191
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:19,380
He is my little brother!

192
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:22,299
Buy him and I will do
whatever you want!

193
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:26,262
No I can't.

194
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:27,138
Please!

195
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:28,388
Stop It!

196
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:44,780
Sit down!

197
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,471
What are we going to tell to my sister?

198
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,539
The truth.

199
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:54,749
What do you mean?

200
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,209
That's God's will.

201
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,295
And that's the way it is.

202
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:37,374
<i>By the law of God it is
forbidden to listen to music,</i>

203
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:41,295
<i>to smoke, to play cards,</i>

204
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:46,425
<i>to be alone in a room with
someone of the opposite sex.</i>

205
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,980
Were going to put her in your room,

206
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:03,559
it will be easier to keep her locked up.
You will sleep in the living room.

207
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,594
Tell me she's not staying?

208
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,654
Clean her up and
give her some clothes!

209
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:18,262
Repeat after me.

210
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,934
<i>There is no God but Allah.</i>

211
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,479
Repeat after me!

212
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:27,039
<i>Dramatic events here in Paris,</i>

213
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:29,662
<i>three terrorists seized
hostages at separate locations</i>

214
00:28:29,687 --> 00:28:32,819
<i>and triggered a wave of terror
right across the french capital.</i>

215
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:37,341
<i>This is the scene right now
at Arc de Triomphe in Paris,</i>

216
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:39,927
<i>a banner "Paris is Charlie",</i>

217
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:43,472
<i>in solidarity with</i>
Charlie Hebdo .<i></i>

218
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,602
They will pay for this.

219
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:56,984
At least

220
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:59,947
this time the whole world
will see what's happened.

221
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,592
You should have told me about it.

222
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:04,136
It's a good sign.
Our cause is becoming popular.

223
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,929
What's wrong?

224
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,598
New recruits.

225
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:08,932
Young?

226
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:10,434
Younger and younger.

227
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,980
I can't take sending coffins back to
countries I don't even know anymore.

228
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:19,026
Thank you so much.

229
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:25,616
Thank you.

230
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:30,870
Nice to meet you.

231
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:41,340
I’m Laura.

232
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:46,636
Welcome.

233
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,724
New comrades from France.

234
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:02,708
Our Kurdish people are very
grateful that you left your homes

235
00:31:02,733 --> 00:31:05,145
too come to fight with the
oppressed against our enemy.

236
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:07,824
Our revolution has no boundaries.

237
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:11,161
It is global, political,
social, ecological.

238
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:13,205
It Is a feminist revolution.
Right?

239
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,791
Yes, you are right it is
also a feminist revolution.

240
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,669
Our mothers have fought,
our daughters will fight

241
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:21,922
We want to free women.
This is our goal in life.

242
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:25,717
We want to create a new better society.

243
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:30,221
What is "Phew"?

244
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:31,640
They love it.

245
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,141
Really.

246
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,308
That's enough.

247
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,186
I can ask a question?

248
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:38,981
Yes.

249
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:41,775
Can we get our phone's back?

250
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:46,113
No phone's no sex,
no life. You are here to fight.

251
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,957
Here are your room.

252
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:58,834
Tomorrow, training.

253
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:01,169
I leave you with your comrade.

254
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:14,016
Long live free Kurdistan!

255
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:17,202
I don't get it?
Why can't we have our phone's back?

256
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,021
You'll get it back after a month.

257
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:22,232
When you get used
to living disconnected.

258
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,986
On mission,
you can take propaganda photos, selfies.

259
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,155
But without a SIM card.

260
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:30,157
Not to be spotted.

261
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:56,474
Smiling.

262
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:31,403
<i>By the law of God it is
forbidden to eat tomatoes</i>

263
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:35,365
<i>whose heart resembles a cross</i>

264
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:39,035
<i>and make love to a corpse</i>

265
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:42,330
<i>more than an hour after his death.</i>

266
00:34:58,805 --> 00:34:59,890
Bathroom.

267
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:02,684
Bathroom!

268
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:43,891
Wake up.

269
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:45,977
Stand up, comrades! Wake up.

270
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,022
Come on, practice.

271
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:52,859
I volunteered as a nurse.

272
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:54,444
Not to fight.

273
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,531
When these bastards want to catch you,

274
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,658
you'll be happy to have it.

275
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:02,035
Now he's your best friend.

276
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:08,458
My best friend is flat,
fits in my pocket

277
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:09,876
and you took it from me.

278
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,219
Six years in the army.

279
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:27,561
Eight months in guerrilla warfare.

280
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:28,979
Comrade Kurda!

281
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,526
Kurdish father.

282
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:36,027
Comrade Yael!

283
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:45,954
Military service in Israel.

284
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:49,874
Comrade Belkacem.

285
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,066
Silence!

286
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,167
A long time ago,

287
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:36,796
when Mesopotamia was not divided
between Persians, Kurds and Arabs,

288
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,090
men respected the Mother goddess.

289
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:43,887
It was with the arrival of
monotheism and capitalism

290
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:47,724
that the system of male
domination has imposed its laws.

291
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,684
You are not the first fighters.

292
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:52,187
Viking women,

293
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:54,522
our Kurdish grandmothers
against the Turks.

294
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,442
But when women rebel,

295
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,653
they are erased from history,

296
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:00,819
of the society.

297
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:02,238
And we send them home.

298
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:04,741
We send them home

299
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,451
to be slaves.

300
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:08,744
Not this time.

301
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:11,247
You are there to tell the world:

302
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:13,333
not this time.

303
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:45,364
What is that?

304
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:25,780
Where is your rage

305
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:41,921
You did it!

306
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:51,616
It's so far!

307
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:54,494
It's part of training.

308
00:40:56,371 --> 00:41:00,125
Why didn't we take one
of the all-terrain vehicles?

309
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,291
They looked great.

310
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:04,003
We used them for
Operation "Free Iraq".

311
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,840
The Americans gave
them to the Kurds.

312
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,800
But we don't have enough,

313
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,969
so we spin them.

314
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:15,890
Since we are talking about it...

315
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:17,475
you Americans

316
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:19,894
what a mess you screwed in Iraq.

317
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:24,149
We're going to sleep here.

318
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,069
Finally.

319
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:33,324
Bless us Lord

320
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,161
and bless this food. Amen.

321
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:40,331
Seriously? After
walking for hours?

322
00:41:43,877 --> 00:41:44,961
Thank you.

323
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,797
Sometimes we don't eat

324
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:49,132
during many days.

325
00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:51,134
But you are not trained enough...

326
00:41:51,968 --> 00:41:53,428
What luck!

327
00:41:55,889 --> 00:41:57,849
Why do you say we screwed up?

328
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:00,101
It’s not America that fucked up,

329
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:02,103
it's that fucking religion.

330
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:08,735
Sooner or later,
all religions screw up on shit.

331
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:10,653
No. Not all.

332
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:15,033
You just have to see the Crusades,
the Inquisition...

333
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,410
You say that because
you are Muslim.

334
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:19,829
No, because I am French.

335
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:21,456
"French secularism"!

336
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:23,958
Yes and so...

337
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:25,627
Did you lost your mind?

338
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,296
Are you serious?

339
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:29,464
Snake.

340
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:30,840
What snake?

341
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:33,467
Shit!

342
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,721
Are there really snakes nearby?

343
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:38,890
I don't sleep here!

344
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:41,517
No way!

345
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:45,438
<i>By the law of God it is forbidden</i>

346
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:49,484
<i>to eat cucumbers recalling
the masculine attribute in public.</i>

347
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:06,209
If you go away,
I warn the virtue committee.

348
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,218
Hello my sister.

349
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:17,804
I am Nadia El Frankaoui.

350
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:21,224
Married to El Britani.

351
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:23,725
Nadia El Britani?

352
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,310
Long live the caliphate.

353
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:28,523
Pass.

354
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,119
God bless you

355
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:43,454
of this unfaithful.

356
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:45,415
This dog

357
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:47,208
is not a brother,

358
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:48,751
he is a traitor.

359
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:51,296
He reads forbidden books,

360
00:43:51,713 --> 00:43:53,798
he lives like an apostate,

361
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:56,759
he serves the enemies of God,

362
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,553
just like these books.

363
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:00,680
Only fire

364
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:02,849
can purify it.

365
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,772
The almond beats the rose bud.

366
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:52,523
Whatever!

367
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,193
So why was the date
beating the almond?

368
00:44:56,361 --> 00:45:00,031
Because it smothers it with its honey.

369
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:04,827
She's there!

370
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:06,954
Hide everything.

371
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,768
You'll see. You will have looked for it!

372
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:32,647
Why did you let her out?

373
00:45:32,939 --> 00:45:34,816
To wear shopping.

374
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:36,818
It's your job.

375
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:38,569
You have to punish her.

376
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:41,114
Stop telling me what to do.

377
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:42,240
Punish her!

378
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:43,574
What did I say?

379
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:05,262
My uncle?

380
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:08,057
<i>Zara,
is that you? Where are you?</i>

381
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:10,309
With a foreign commander
in the city center.

382
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:14,397
<i>I'm going to exfiltrate you
but you have to escape first.</i>

383
00:46:14,564 --> 00:46:16,649
I can not.

384
00:46:16,816 --> 00:46:19,110
<i>Listen. Get out of this house.</i>

385
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:23,156
<i>Hide and then call me.</i>

386
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,322
<i>Promise me.</i>

387
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:25,616
Promised.

388
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:28,035
<i>You have to know,</i>

389
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,663
<i>your brother is alive.</i>

390
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:34,417
<i>And we were able to buy your mother.</i>

391
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,420
<i>Don't worry, everything will be fine.</i>

392
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:48,889
SLEEPING TABLETS

393
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,936
That's enough, hurry up.

394
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:30,555
Eat.

395
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:35,436
It's better than your cooking.

396
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:54,056
Hold on!

397
00:48:54,223 --> 00:48:56,142
Do you really want me to stay?

398
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,315
Standing! She ran away!

399
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:47,359
Shit!

400
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:13,678
I lost myself.

401
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,806
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- On the market place, I think.

402
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:18,099
<i>Calm down.</i>

403
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:22,395
<i>The smuggler will take
you outside the city.</i>

404
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:25,064
<i>Follow the main
street and wait for it.</i>

405
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:27,065
Okay.

406
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:04,520
Zara?

407
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:12,820
You took some time.

408
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:13,987
Go up!

409
00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:50,399
Do you see the hill?

410
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:53,110
The free zone is behind.

411
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:55,279
Other refugees are heading there.

412
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:56,530
Join them.

413
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:59,408
You are supposed to take
me there. My uncle paid.

414
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:00,659
You are too late.

415
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:03,245
It is too dangerous.

416
00:52:03,412 --> 00:52:04,412
Get out!

417
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:12,755
Get out!

418
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:20,364
Run!

419
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:36,130
Go for it!

420
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:00,029
Protect the refugees, we attack!

421
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:06,367
Take shelter!

422
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:29,349
Warning!

423
00:54:42,905 --> 00:54:44,156
They killed our guys!

424
00:54:52,957 --> 00:54:53,957
Let's go!

425
00:54:58,504 --> 00:54:59,630
I got it!

426
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:01,423
El Tounsi!

427
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:04,550
Fight!

428
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:06,719
Shit!

429
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,103
Faster!

430
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:16,146
They're rushing at the refugees!

431
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:18,273
Pass me Snoopy!

432
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:52,725
Come on!

433
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,325
What is that?

434
00:56:11,744 --> 00:56:12,536
Mad Max.

435
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:13,871
A suicide tank.

436
00:56:44,568 --> 00:56:45,652
Give!

437
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:50,199
Fire!

438
00:56:58,749 --> 00:56:59,749
Shit!

439
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:03,879
The phone!

440
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:06,673
Now!

441
00:57:10,511 --> 00:57:11,553
Run!

442
00:57:13,806 --> 00:57:14,973
I Don'tsee it.

443
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,392
Go for it! What are you waiting for?

444
00:57:20,229 --> 00:57:21,230
Come on...

445
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:44,878
Look at the!

446
00:58:57,826 --> 00:58:59,369
This is why we are here.

447
01:00:03,225 --> 01:00:05,269
They took us all...

448
01:00:05,686 --> 01:00:07,187
on top of the mountain

449
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:08,897
to execute us.

450
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:14,403
I felt

451
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:18,073
the ball cross my body.

452
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:24,037
When they left...

453
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,581
I was still breathing.

454
01:00:57,029 --> 01:00:58,530
The chief arrives.

455
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:07,414
Are you okay, chief?

456
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:11,626
A sip?

457
01:01:13,128 --> 01:01:14,713
Come on, for once!

458
01:01:15,547 --> 01:01:16,882
Come on, take a sip.

459
01:01:23,472 --> 01:01:24,514
She's going!

460
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:29,186
Its good!

461
01:02:44,803 --> 01:02:45,929
Keiro...

462
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:00,609
Your husband?

463
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:03,738
Yes.

464
01:03:06,158 --> 01:03:07,534
Let me guess...

465
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:09,661
He is also in the army.

466
01:03:10,871 --> 01:03:11,872
He was.

467
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:14,166
He died 5 years ago.

468
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:16,835
An ambush in Iraq.

469
01:03:18,587 --> 01:03:20,130
Shit, Snipe.

470
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:21,798
Sorry.

471
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:23,175
I did not know.

472
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:24,509
worry.

473
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:03,924
<i>"My beloved brother,</i>

474
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,053
<i>"forgive me.</i>

475
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:13,975
<i>"I'm leaving to avenge
our father and find Keiro.</i>

476
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:16,728
<i>"It must.</i>

477
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:18,522
<i>"I need it.</i>

478
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:22,776
<i>"Otherwise, I will go mad.</i>

479
01:04:25,904 --> 01:04:27,072
<i>"Take care of mom.</i>

480
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:29,324
<i>"Take her to Germany.</i>

481
01:04:30,242 --> 01:04:32,744
<i>"I need to know you are safe.</i>

482
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,801
<i>"One day,</i>

483
01:04:47,968 --> 01:04:51,137
<i>"maybe,
if God and the angels are with us,</i>

484
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:54,057
<i>"I will find you and
we will live as before.</i>

485
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:03,190
<i>"I love you.</i>

486
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:06,361
<i>"Like no sister has
ever loved her brother."</i>

487
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:50,572
What's your name?

488
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:51,905
Zara.

489
01:05:52,032 --> 01:05:53,325
Me, it's Laura.

490
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:55,410
Here I am called Mother Sun.

491
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:57,621
We all have a code name.

492
01:05:57,787 --> 01:05:59,664
She is Lady Kurda.

493
01:05:59,831 --> 01:06:00,831
Welcome aboard.

494
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Our chef

495
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:05,420
is known as the Lioness of Kobane.

496
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:08,214
The one driving
is American Sniper,

497
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:10,050
but it's called Snipe.

498
01:06:10,884 --> 01:06:15,180
Why, Yael and I,
we don't have cool names like you?

499
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:16,388
It will come.

500
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:17,599
Sure?

501
01:06:18,058 --> 01:06:19,058
Top.

502
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:21,561
In the meantime, my name is Yael.

503
01:06:22,562 --> 01:06:24,105
And me, Kenza.

504
01:06:24,689 --> 01:06:26,191
I am French. We are...

505
01:06:26,358 --> 01:06:29,402
And that is Dushka, our goddess!

506
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:16,199
Zara, you will see,
after training,

507
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:18,618
we always walk for hours

508
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:20,620
and you never know where you're going.

509
01:07:22,122 --> 01:07:23,832
We're going to the front.

510
01:07:24,499 --> 01:07:25,709
OK, comrades?

511
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:32,966
We all need to rest.
Can we stop here?

512
01:07:33,133 --> 01:07:34,217
Yes, let's rest.

513
01:07:38,138 --> 01:07:39,139
Girls!

514
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:41,307
Come see, we can soak!

515
01:07:42,934 --> 01:07:45,603
For once,
she won't take all the water.

516
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:53,528
- She is good?
- Too much!

517
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:56,364
Admit it is frozen.

518
01:07:56,531 --> 01:07:57,741
Frozen!

519
01:07:58,366 --> 01:07:59,909
You don't want to go there?

520
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:04,247
We can just dip our feet.

521
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:07,374
Zara!

522
01:08:08,752 --> 01:08:09,961
Are you ready?

523
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:48,541
She's crazy.

524
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:51,753
You are not married?

525
01:08:52,921 --> 01:08:54,339
It's the only stupidity

526
01:08:54,506 --> 01:08:56,007
that I managed to avoid.

527
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:02,514
But I have a boyfriend waiting for me.

528
01:09:40,635 --> 01:09:41,886
A cemetery?

529
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:45,056
Do they go after the dead now?

530
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:48,518
These tombstones
belong to the Yezidi temple.

531
01:09:49,352 --> 01:09:51,354
The jihadists destroyed it.

532
01:09:53,481 --> 01:09:56,067
They hate you even
more than the Jews.

533
01:09:58,069 --> 01:09:59,112
Really?

534
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:01,281
Still not.

535
01:10:02,824 --> 01:10:05,952
This is the 74th time that my
people have suffered genocide.

536
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:10,456
Still...

537
01:10:10,874 --> 01:10:15,211
Turks and Arabs have been
trying to eliminate them for centuries.

538
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:16,629
Even some Kurds...

539
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:18,089
Not all Kurds.

540
01:10:18,798 --> 01:10:20,592
Don't start confusing them.

541
01:11:17,565 --> 01:11:18,565
Perhaps.

542
01:11:23,321 --> 01:11:24,405
Comrades!

543
01:11:24,948 --> 01:11:27,158
Come! We found a place to camp!

544
01:11:27,951 --> 01:11:28,952
Now!

545
01:11:42,674 --> 01:11:44,342
In fact, we are the same.

546
01:11:44,509 --> 01:11:45,509
To know?

547
01:11:47,387 --> 01:11:48,387
But if...

548
01:11:49,263 --> 01:11:51,224
cool Muslim, cool Muslim.

549
01:11:56,187 --> 01:11:57,730
Do you see these mountains?

550
01:11:58,898 --> 01:12:00,817
It's my only religion.

551
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:15,540
Your parents angry with God

552
01:12:15,707 --> 01:12:16,833
by worshiping the devil.

553
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:18,501
That is why

554
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:21,754
your false angel
did not protect you.

555
01:12:22,255 --> 01:12:23,506
Now,

556
01:12:24,549 --> 01:12:27,343
you are His army

557
01:12:28,553 --> 01:12:30,388
and you will fight His enemies.

558
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:54,537
Well done,

559
01:12:55,747 --> 01:12:57,373
you deserved the key

560
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,085
for paradise.

561
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:15,725
comrades

562
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:18,811
it's time to choose
your war names.

563
01:13:20,271 --> 01:13:21,439
Comrade Belkacem?

564
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:23,232
"Kahina".

565
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:30,364
A very, very long time ago,

566
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:32,325
maybe a thousand years,

567
01:13:32,492 --> 01:13:34,952
it was the name of a
Berber warrior queen

568
01:13:36,704 --> 01:13:39,123
overlapping

569
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:41,793
to terrorize his enemies.

570
01:13:42,794 --> 01:13:44,253
Comrade Kahina,

571
01:13:45,004 --> 01:13:46,255
Welcome to you.

572
01:13:46,631 --> 01:13:48,424
May this name protect you.

573
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:55,640
And you, Comrade Cohen?

574
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:56,932
"Sashka".

575
01:14:04,732 --> 01:14:05,732
Sashka?

576
01:14:06,609 --> 01:14:10,071
It was my grandmother's nickname.

577
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:14,575
She was deported
when she was your age,

578
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:16,744
She died

579
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,955
just before I join you.

580
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:22,625
Sashka,

581
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:27,130
that this name gives you
the strength to save the world.

582
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:34,303
What about you, Zara?

583
01:14:36,556 --> 01:14:37,682
"Red Snake".

584
01:14:39,142 --> 01:14:40,142
The Red

585
01:14:40,268 --> 01:14:42,770
is an important
color for yazidis

586
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:47,108
and you, the Serpent Brigade,

587
01:14:50,153 --> 01:14:51,445
you saved me.

588
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:57,493
Welcome, Red Snake.

589
01:14:58,452 --> 01:14:59,579
Welcome.

590
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:04,667
Always keep one
last ball for yourself.

591
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:07,962
So as not to fall into enemy hands.

592
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:14,218
It seems that you are drawing.

593
01:15:15,261 --> 01:15:17,597
If you give me a drawing,
I can tattoo it for you.

594
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:22,894
I haven't drawn since...

595
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,357
Did you stay there for a long time?

596
01:15:31,569 --> 01:15:32,945
Too long.

597
01:15:34,989 --> 01:15:36,365
My little brother...

598
01:15:43,623 --> 01:15:45,166
He is always with them,

599
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:46,792
somewhere.

600
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:51,379
What's his name?

601
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:53,883
Keiro.

602
01:15:57,303 --> 01:15:58,346
We'll find it.

603
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:29,543
It's my sister.

604
01:16:30,878 --> 01:16:31,963
Katia.

605
01:16:36,217 --> 01:16:37,551
She died before I was born.

606
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:44,100
In the 90s in Algeria,

607
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:48,354
jihadists warned that
they would kill any woman

608
01:16:48,521 --> 01:16:50,898
going to school without a veil.

609
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:55,444
She refused.

610
01:16:57,196 --> 01:16:58,364
My father

611
01:16:58,823 --> 01:17:02,076
found her lying
in her own blood.

612
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:06,497
Our neighbors had killed her.

613
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:31,624
We've been circling
them for weeks.

614
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:35,669
But we lack reinforcements.

615
01:18:39,507 --> 01:18:40,507
Stand back.

616
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:51,142
Nice shot.

617
01:18:53,854 --> 01:18:55,898
<i>The infidels attack from the south</i>

618
01:18:56,065 --> 01:18:57,608
<i>Pray, my brothers.</i>

619
01:18:59,693 --> 01:19:02,196
You can still pray. We arrive!

620
01:19:10,996 --> 01:19:12,289
And now?

621
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:15,292
We wait.

622
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:18,920
What?

623
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:20,840
<i>Sugar delivery!</i>

624
01:19:24,885 --> 01:19:26,178
It.

625
01:19:32,685 --> 01:19:34,854
Are we going to bomb the village?

626
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:37,148
There are lots of civilians.

627
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:11,432
Be the first to.

628
01:20:41,378 --> 01:20:42,880
What a smell!

629
01:20:43,547 --> 01:20:45,424
Jihadist barbecue...

630
01:20:45,758 --> 01:20:46,758
Stop.

631
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:01,315
The bastard couldn't
set off his bomb.

632
01:21:20,626 --> 01:21:22,378
Don't touch it! They trap toys.

633
01:21:23,003 --> 01:21:25,047
See the yellow
thread? It is a mine.

634
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:40,896
They even erase the image
of women on shampoos?

635
01:21:54,285 --> 01:21:56,537
I have my first aid kit.

636
01:21:56,829 --> 01:21:59,290
We are not there to
save their supporters.

637
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:02,126
What supporter, Rosalyn?

638
01:22:02,293 --> 01:22:03,669
He's a kid.

639
01:22:05,796 --> 01:22:06,922
What are you doing?

640
01:22:19,393 --> 01:22:20,394
Do something!

641
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:27,234
Where are you going?

642
01:22:27,401 --> 01:22:29,403
In your opinion?
I'm going to take her!

643
01:22:37,494 --> 01:22:38,662
Covered!

644
01:22:51,425 --> 01:22:52,425
Lower yourself!

645
01:22:59,058 --> 01:23:00,058
You see it?

646
01:23:01,935 --> 01:23:02,935
I Don'tsee him.

647
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:04,520
I Don'tsee him.

648
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:07,982
Bend down!

649
01:23:10,069 --> 01:23:11,236
Do you want to kill us?

650
01:23:14,448 --> 01:23:16,200
Stay down.

651
01:25:16,195 --> 01:25:17,237
It's over for me.

652
01:25:19,031 --> 01:25:20,240
<i>It's finish.</i>

653
01:25:21,909 --> 01:25:23,577
<i>I love you, my sisters.</i>

654
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:30,143
We share but I go first.

655
01:27:27,743 --> 01:27:28,743
Don'tmove!

656
01:27:38,337 --> 01:27:40,088
I got it. Let's go.

657
01:28:43,443 --> 01:28:44,443
Hide yourself!

658
01:29:05,465 --> 01:29:06,465
Search the houses!

659
01:29:08,218 --> 01:29:09,428
Come on! Come on!

660
01:29:50,135 --> 01:29:52,220
Chief, this one is alive!

661
01:29:58,852 --> 01:30:00,395
It's El Britani.

662
01:30:03,273 --> 01:30:04,273
It's him.

663
01:30:10,489 --> 01:30:11,489
He's an officer.

664
01:30:12,574 --> 01:30:14,159
We need to make him talk.

665
01:31:19,266 --> 01:31:20,934
Our code of honor prohibits us

666
01:31:21,101 --> 01:31:22,352
to torture.

667
01:31:22,519 --> 01:31:24,354
Not like you, bunch of animals.

668
01:31:25,397 --> 01:31:26,773
Too bad.

669
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:29,568
In your place, I will enjoy myself.

670
01:31:35,824 --> 01:31:37,033
I know where Abu Mariam is.

671
01:31:37,617 --> 01:31:40,453
I'll tell a man if he
swears to kill me for you.

672
01:31:41,538 --> 01:31:45,292
How do you know where Abu Mariam
is? It changes hiding all the time.

673
01:31:46,084 --> 01:31:47,460
There will be a ceremony

674
01:31:47,627 --> 01:31:50,046
to offer her slaves this Thursday.

675
01:31:50,672 --> 01:31:52,424
I had to bring him your heads.

676
01:31:55,093 --> 01:31:56,344
Your brother will be there.

677
01:31:58,263 --> 01:31:59,263
What?

678
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:01,349
What are you talking about?

679
01:32:01,683 --> 01:32:03,059
I'll tell a man,

680
01:32:03,226 --> 01:32:05,687
if he swears to kill me afterwards.

681
01:32:09,399 --> 01:32:10,399
You'll have it.

682
01:32:11,151 --> 01:32:13,028
But only if you tell the truth.

683
01:32:13,612 --> 01:32:14,654
If not,

684
01:32:14,821 --> 01:32:17,157
I'll cut your throat myself.

685
01:32:52,275 --> 01:32:55,445
I feel it inside me all the time.

686
01:32:55,946 --> 01:32:57,614
His smell...

687
01:32:58,156 --> 01:33:00,158
His face disgusts me...

688
01:33:00,617 --> 01:33:01,701
You'll get out of it.

689
01:33:03,328 --> 01:33:04,955
But it takes time.

690
01:33:06,831 --> 01:33:07,916
Believe me.

691
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:16,424
I was 16 when it happened to me.

692
01:33:18,551 --> 01:33:21,596
It took me years to understand
that it was not my fault.

693
01:33:24,557 --> 01:33:26,434
And it wasn't my fault.

694
01:33:30,146 --> 01:33:31,481
It's a war.

695
01:33:33,066 --> 01:33:34,776
If it's a war,

696
01:33:37,112 --> 01:33:40,240
why am I so ashamed

697
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:45,203
When men come back from the front,

698
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:47,539
they show their wounds,

699
01:33:47,706 --> 01:33:49,833
we look at them as heroes.

700
01:33:50,834 --> 01:33:52,794
Whereas I...

701
01:33:53,962 --> 01:33:55,880
I'm so ashamed.

702
01:33:56,673 --> 01:33:58,675
Zara, you are so brave.

703
01:33:59,926 --> 01:34:00,927
Look at me.

704
01:34:03,179 --> 01:34:04,681
The invasion you suffered

705
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:06,641
is deeper

706
01:34:07,142 --> 01:34:09,394
and more cruel than bullets.

707
01:34:09,769 --> 01:34:11,271
And yet you are there.

708
01:34:11,896 --> 01:34:12,896
Standing.

709
01:34:12,981 --> 01:34:14,024
You are fighting.

710
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:16,693
You are strong.

711
01:34:18,778 --> 01:34:21,906
Wars have always been
waged on the bodies of women.

712
01:34:23,658 --> 01:34:25,452
But there, for once,

713
01:34:25,744 --> 01:34:27,329
they fear us.

714
01:34:28,747 --> 01:34:30,623
This fear is our strength.

715
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:47,640
Finally, we hold the laptop
of a lieutenant of Abu Mariam.

716
01:34:47,807 --> 01:34:50,560
We know that it never circulates...

717
01:34:51,102 --> 01:34:53,438
without guards or human shields.

718
01:34:53,605 --> 01:34:57,025
But we will be able to track it.

719
01:35:14,042 --> 01:35:15,042
You will not dare.

720
01:35:15,752 --> 01:35:16,752
Where is my brother

721
01:35:18,254 --> 01:35:19,547
It's a lion cub now.

722
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:21,966
Abou Mariam transformed him.

723
01:35:22,467 --> 01:35:25,345
It is his favorite.
Always by his side.

724
01:35:25,512 --> 01:35:27,097
One day he will be a martyr.

725
01:35:27,722 --> 01:35:29,766
He will explode in a
crowd of disbelievers.

726
01:35:30,225 --> 01:35:31,267
No!

727
01:35:31,434 --> 01:35:33,186
- You lie!
- Not at all.

728
01:35:33,353 --> 01:35:35,105
There is a video online.

729
01:35:35,271 --> 01:35:37,816
It's enormous. Go see
if you don't believe me.

730
01:35:40,068 --> 01:35:41,277
You will not do it.

731
01:35:49,577 --> 01:35:51,830
You are weak. Like your father.

732
01:35:52,622 --> 01:35:55,667
He was screaming when Abu
Mariam shot him in the head.

733
01:35:55,834 --> 01:35:58,753
He was screaming like you,
when I entered you.

734
01:36:00,964 --> 01:36:02,590
You liked it, right?

735
01:36:02,757 --> 01:36:04,134
Come on, admit it.

736
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:06,261
Women enjoy when you force them.

737
01:36:06,428 --> 01:36:08,054
I felt you enjoy a hundred times!

738
01:38:07,632 --> 01:38:09,092
This gift

739
01:38:09,259 --> 01:38:10,260
is for you.

740
01:38:17,517 --> 01:38:18,517
Following!

741
01:38:19,310 --> 01:38:20,310
Keiro...

742
01:38:28,945 --> 01:38:32,156
This gift is for you.

743
01:39:33,676 --> 01:39:34,719
Cover me!

744
01:39:46,439 --> 01:39:47,439
I advance!

745
01:39:47,523 --> 01:39:48,523
I've got your back!

746
01:39:54,030 --> 01:39:55,030
Free way!

747
01:39:55,156 --> 01:39:56,156
I arrive!

748
01:40:49,877 --> 01:40:51,254
Your brother! Go!

749
01:41:07,061 --> 01:41:08,146
Come on, little lion.

750
01:41:08,312 --> 01:41:10,148
You're ready.

751
01:41:10,398 --> 01:41:11,149
Come on!

752
01:41:11,315 --> 01:41:13,901
You can do it. Join the Lord!

753
01:41:22,577 --> 01:41:23,703
Damn it!

754
01:41:30,460 --> 01:41:32,420
Slowly slowly...

755
01:41:45,725 --> 01:41:47,059
Bring back Abu Mariam.

756
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:49,103
Okay.

757
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:10,540
Whore!

758
01:42:16,506 --> 01:42:17,506
It's okay?

759
01:42:24,472 --> 01:42:25,640
Keiro.

760
01:42:27,725 --> 01:42:28,851
Look at me.

761
01:42:31,103 --> 01:42:32,104
It's me.

762
01:42:34,524 --> 01:42:35,817
Look at me.

763
01:43:05,972 --> 01:43:07,098
He is mine.

764
01:43:51,934 --> 01:43:53,227
Don't smile.

765
01:43:54,312 --> 01:43:56,397
There will be no paradise for you.

766
01:44:06,991 --> 01:44:07,991
Zara!

767
01:45:45,756 --> 01:45:47,008
What do you have?

768
01:45:50,511 --> 01:45:52,346
The Coalition abandons us.

769
01:45:52,513 --> 01:45:55,391
It will not support
our independence.

770
01:45:57,226 --> 01:45:58,853
We will create an independent Kurdistan

771
01:45:59,020 --> 01:46:00,271
without them.

772
01:46:14,326 --> 01:46:15,453
Kiss Me.

773
01:46:16,078 --> 01:46:16,829
Here?

774
01:46:16,996 --> 01:46:17,996
You are crazy?

775
01:46:22,835 --> 01:46:23,835
So what?

776
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:27,465
We didn't fight
to live like them.

777
01:46:27,882 --> 01:46:29,216
Come on, kiss me.

778
01:47:03,709 --> 01:47:05,044
I want to show you something.

779
01:47:05,544 --> 01:47:06,587
Come.

780
01:47:29,693 --> 01:47:32,071
I wanted to finish it before you leave.

781
01:47:33,948 --> 01:47:36,826
Like that, Kenza will always be there.

782
01:47:59,014 --> 01:48:00,349
It's beautiful.

783
01:48:00,516 --> 01:48:02,101
You are a real artist.

784
01:48:03,978 --> 01:48:04,978
Zara,

785
01:48:05,146 --> 01:48:07,273
who is the woman in the drawing?

786
01:48:09,024 --> 01:48:11,569
An angel who shows us the future.

787
01:48:12,611 --> 01:48:13,946
Are you sure?

788
01:48:14,321 --> 01:48:15,573
It's a girl.

789
01:48:17,116 --> 01:48:19,326
Juror, spitting.

790
01:52:16,855 --> 01:52:18,899
Subtitling: Clog.

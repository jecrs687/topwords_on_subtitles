1
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:32,670
Oh, my God!

2
00:01:08,053 --> 00:01:09,924
Over here, over here!

3
00:01:10,055 --> 00:01:11,012
There's somebody in the water.

4
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:15,060
There's somebody in the water.

5
00:01:26,506 --> 00:01:27,638
Serious head trauma.

6
00:01:27,768 --> 00:01:30,684
Get me the CAT-scan results.

7
00:01:30,815 --> 00:01:33,382
Has her breathing stabilized?

8
00:01:33,513 --> 00:01:35,602
Check her vitals.

9
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:38,474
Checking pulse.

10
00:01:38,605 --> 00:01:40,868
We may need some more
sutures on that laceration.

11
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:44,829
Lots of blood loss here.

12
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:46,221
Get me the CAT-scan results.

13
00:01:46,352 --> 00:01:48,876
Pupils are dilated.

14
00:01:49,007 --> 00:01:51,618
Pupils are reacting, Marilyn,
get me the blood pressure.

15
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:53,141
Marilyn, get me
the CAT-scan results.

16
00:01:53,272 --> 00:01:54,273
Lots of blood loss here.

17
00:01:54,403 --> 00:01:55,709
Pupils are dilated.

18
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,971
What happened to her?
Serious head trauma.

19
00:01:57,102 --> 00:01:58,190
Marilyn, get me
the blood pressure.

20
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,670
Fishermen pulled her
out of the ocean.

21
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,150
Boating accident?

22
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:03,978
Any change in her condition?

23
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:06,328
Umm...

24
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,636
Stabilized, but no change.

25
00:02:09,767 --> 00:02:10,985
Anyone come to ID her yet?

26
00:02:11,116 --> 00:02:12,160
Not yet.

27
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:13,945
We still don't know who she is.

28
00:02:18,645 --> 00:02:20,038
Yeah, I'm looking for my fiancée.

29
00:02:20,168 --> 00:02:21,082
Her name is Brooke Harris.

30
00:02:21,213 --> 00:02:22,605
I'm Dr. Kaplan, can I help you?
Yes.

31
00:02:22,736 --> 00:02:24,129
He's looking for his fiancée.
Her name was Brooke Harris.

32
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:25,957
She was on a boat
late last night,

33
00:02:26,087 --> 00:02:27,523
and I think she might
have fallen overboard.

34
00:02:27,654 --> 00:02:28,829
And who are you?

35
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,613
My name is Michael Coleman,
I'm her fiancé.

36
00:02:30,744 --> 00:02:32,137
Now, I've been to
three hospitals already

37
00:02:32,267 --> 00:02:34,922
and your receptionist said that
you had a Jane Doe here.

38
00:02:35,053 --> 00:02:36,445
Is that her?

39
00:02:36,576 --> 00:02:37,795
Yes.

40
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:39,013
We were beginning to
think nobody would come,

41
00:02:39,144 --> 00:02:40,711
there was no identification,
nothing on the news.

42
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:42,234
Where is she?
Can I see her?

43
00:02:42,364 --> 00:02:43,583
Of course.

44
00:02:43,714 --> 00:02:44,802
Please, have a seat.

45
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:46,542
Get me her file.
Yes, Doctor.

46
00:02:46,673 --> 00:02:47,718
Is she okay?

47
00:02:47,848 --> 00:02:48,980
I mean, tell me she's all right.

48
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,590
Mr. Coleman, I know
it's been a long night.

49
00:02:50,721 --> 00:02:52,984
Doctor, please, just tell
me she's all right.

50
00:02:53,114 --> 00:02:56,074
Your fiancée has suffered
from some severe trauma.

51
00:02:56,204 --> 00:02:58,554
We need to run a couple more
tests before you can see her.

52
00:02:58,685 --> 00:03:00,165
Okay.

53
00:03:00,295 --> 00:03:01,644
I promise, as soon
as I run those tests,

54
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:03,864
I'll take you to her, okay?

55
00:03:03,995 --> 00:03:05,170
I'll be right back.

56
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,263
Fluids are low, increase the drip.

57
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,658
Blood pressure has stabilized.

58
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:18,749
Lacerations around the scalp.

59
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,577
Her legs seem to look good.

60
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:24,493
Should heal nicely with
minimal scarring, if any.

61
00:03:27,758 --> 00:03:30,195
Pupils are reactive.

62
00:03:30,325 --> 00:03:32,197
Marilyn, did you get
the CAT-scan results yet?

63
00:03:32,327 --> 00:03:33,981
Yeah.

64
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,465
The swelling has
gone down considerably.

65
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:41,815
I don't think we're looking
at any permanent damage.

66
00:03:49,518 --> 00:03:50,781
Do you see these?

67
00:03:50,911 --> 00:03:52,695
You can tell by
the purplish colors

68
00:03:52,826 --> 00:03:55,568
that these are more recent,
the ones from last night.

69
00:03:55,698 --> 00:03:58,310
The others, the greenish ones...

70
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,965
What do you see?

71
00:04:01,095 --> 00:04:04,969
These bruises were sustained
before the boating accident?

72
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:07,623
File a report with the police
just to be on the safe side.

73
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,543
Mr. Coleman.

74
00:04:14,674 --> 00:04:16,502
Doctor, how is she?

75
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:18,896
Can I see her now?

76
00:04:40,178 --> 00:04:41,701
Oh.

77
00:04:53,365 --> 00:04:56,107
That's everything she had
on her when she was found.

78
00:05:04,463 --> 00:05:07,901
That's funny, I don't
remember seeing that before.

79
00:05:08,032 --> 00:05:09,990
Wouldn't leave
the house without it.

80
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:15,082
Brooke, baby, can you hear me?

81
00:05:20,348 --> 00:05:22,568
It's me, it's Michael.

82
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,665
I'm here now, baby,
everything's gonna be okay.

83
00:05:37,844 --> 00:05:39,454
I'm gonna take you home.

84
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:43,545
I need a moment with you.

85
00:05:59,387 --> 00:06:01,955
Your fiancée suffered a
heavy blunt-force trauma

86
00:06:02,086 --> 00:06:03,478
to the head in the accident.

87
00:06:03,609 --> 00:06:05,698
She's in a coma.
What?

88
00:06:05,828 --> 00:06:08,527
She has a severe concussion.

89
00:06:08,657 --> 00:06:11,791
Her brain is swollen,
putting pressure on the spine.

90
00:06:11,922 --> 00:06:14,054
The good news is that the
inflammation is going down,

91
00:06:14,185 --> 00:06:15,969
so I don't perceive...

92
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:23,455
Umm...

93
00:06:23,585 --> 00:06:27,111
Is there anything
that can be done?

94
00:06:27,241 --> 00:06:30,331
The only thing we can do
right now is wait.

95
00:06:30,462 --> 00:06:32,290
There's no telling
how long it may last.

96
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,769
It could be a day, a week.

97
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,381
There's really no guarantees.

98
00:06:36,511 --> 00:06:38,209
She's in the best care here.

99
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:41,603
We'll be watching
her round the clock.

100
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,344
But there's something else.

101
00:06:43,475 --> 00:06:44,955
We found bruises on her
that appeared to have

102
00:06:45,085 --> 00:06:47,392
occurred before the accident.

103
00:06:47,522 --> 00:06:49,350
From what?

104
00:06:49,481 --> 00:06:52,484
I was hoping maybe
you could tell me.

105
00:06:52,614 --> 00:06:55,139
Brooke's a pretty athletic girl.

106
00:06:55,269 --> 00:06:59,099
She... she plays
tennis, goes hiking.

107
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:02,233
I suppose it could be from
any one of those.

108
00:07:02,363 --> 00:07:03,843
You should be aware that
it's hospital policy

109
00:07:03,974 --> 00:07:07,673
to report any
suspicious injuries.

110
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:09,066
What?
What are you saying?

111
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:11,633
Not that I'm accusing
anyone of anything.

112
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,071
What, no, you think
that I hit her?

113
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:15,855
That I abuse her?
No.

114
00:07:15,986 --> 00:07:17,248
I'm not saying that at all.

115
00:07:17,378 --> 00:07:20,468
I'm just saying I have
to fill out the report.

116
00:07:23,558 --> 00:07:26,170
I understand.

117
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,086
Look, I need you to be strong
for her right now, okay?

118
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,427
She's awake!

119
00:08:06,558 --> 00:08:09,213
Somebody, she's awake!

120
00:08:09,343 --> 00:08:11,824
She's in shock, she doesn't
know where she is.

121
00:08:11,954 --> 00:08:13,391
Can you hear me?

122
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:14,435
Can you understand?

123
00:08:14,566 --> 00:08:16,089
Can you hear me?

124
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,960
Give me a sign
that you can hear me.

125
00:08:21,051 --> 00:08:23,140
You're at County Hospital.

126
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,489
You were brought here
for treatment.

127
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:27,666
I'm Dr. Kaplan.

128
00:08:27,796 --> 00:08:29,494
Michael's here.

129
00:08:29,624 --> 00:08:31,322
He's been by your side
the entire time.

130
00:08:31,452 --> 00:08:34,194
I'm right here, sweetheart.

131
00:08:34,325 --> 00:08:36,196
Do you know
what happened to you?

132
00:08:39,939 --> 00:08:41,549
Everything will be fine.

133
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,421
You're safe here.

134
00:08:47,033 --> 00:08:49,992
Okay, shh...

135
00:08:50,123 --> 00:08:54,954
Tell me if you can
understand, okay?

136
00:08:55,085 --> 00:08:57,348
You had a serious accident.

137
00:08:57,478 --> 00:08:59,393
You were in a coma
for almost two days.

138
00:08:59,524 --> 00:09:02,831
You're lucky to be alive.

139
00:09:02,962 --> 00:09:05,007
Do you remember your name?

140
00:09:05,138 --> 00:09:06,922
Brooke.

141
00:09:09,142 --> 00:09:11,405
That's good.

142
00:09:11,536 --> 00:09:13,364
Do you remember the accident?

143
00:09:13,494 --> 00:09:15,409
Anything about how you got here?

144
00:09:20,197 --> 00:09:22,982
Everything's gonna be fine.

145
00:09:23,113 --> 00:09:24,026
You rest now.

146
00:09:24,157 --> 00:09:25,767
We'll continue later.

147
00:09:39,303 --> 00:09:41,740
What's going on?
Why is she like this?

148
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,917
I know this is
very difficult for you.

149
00:09:45,047 --> 00:09:47,180
The concussion has caused
swelling of the lobes,

150
00:09:47,311 --> 00:09:49,051
which puts
pressure on the spine.

151
00:09:49,182 --> 00:09:51,924
The brain is bruised.

152
00:09:52,054 --> 00:09:54,144
The injuries she sustained
caused damage to

153
00:09:54,274 --> 00:09:57,538
the area
responsible for her memory.

154
00:09:57,669 --> 00:09:58,931
Like amnesia?

155
00:09:59,061 --> 00:10:00,150
What, is it permanent?

156
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,760
Most cases, the memory
does come back,

157
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,892
it just takes some time.

158
00:10:04,023 --> 00:10:05,981
How much time?

159
00:10:06,112 --> 00:10:07,592
It varies on the patient.

160
00:10:07,722 --> 00:10:10,029
It depends on
the extent of the damage.

161
00:10:12,553 --> 00:10:14,947
What can be done?

162
00:10:15,077 --> 00:10:17,254
Just be patient with her.

163
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:18,646
It's gonna take
some getting used to,

164
00:10:18,777 --> 00:10:21,040
but she will get better.

165
00:10:21,171 --> 00:10:22,215
Just be there for her.

166
00:10:22,346 --> 00:10:24,217
If she's struggling, help her.

167
00:10:24,348 --> 00:10:26,350
People, places.

168
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,221
She's gonna rely on you to
help cope with her memory.

169
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,663
Okay, when can I take her home?

170
00:10:35,794 --> 00:10:37,361
A couple of days.

171
00:10:37,491 --> 00:10:40,277
I need to run a few
more tests first.

172
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:42,148
Okay.

173
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:44,498
Now she needs her rest.

174
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:46,413
Okay, it's important she
isn't subjected to

175
00:10:46,544 --> 00:10:49,851
anything too stressful...
physically, emotionally.

176
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,158
She's had enough
excitement for today.

177
00:10:52,289 --> 00:10:53,986
Okay, I understand.

178
00:10:59,687 --> 00:11:03,387
Please don't worry if
you can't remember anything.

179
00:11:03,517 --> 00:11:04,692
Bits and pieces will come back

180
00:11:04,823 --> 00:11:06,303
and then, I promise,

181
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,348
everything will fall into
place eventually.

182
00:11:16,835 --> 00:11:19,359
I was so worried when
I found you here like this.

183
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,755
I mean, if something
happened to you...

184
00:11:27,846 --> 00:11:29,413
...I really
don't know what I'd do.

185
00:11:37,595 --> 00:11:39,466
You don't remember me
at all, do you?

186
00:12:08,147 --> 00:12:10,758
I know how hard this is for you.

187
00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:12,151
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:12,282 --> 00:12:14,022
No.

189
00:12:14,153 --> 00:12:16,242
Don't you be.

190
00:12:23,684 --> 00:12:25,425
The most important thing is
that you're all right.

191
00:12:29,734 --> 00:12:33,651
And I promise you,
I'm gonna help you

192
00:12:33,781 --> 00:12:35,957
and we're gonna get
through this, okay?

193
00:12:39,874 --> 00:12:41,572
They're gonna let us get
out of here in a couple days,

194
00:12:41,702 --> 00:12:44,444
and...

195
00:12:44,575 --> 00:12:46,968
I wanna take you to
our vacation house.

196
00:12:50,276 --> 00:12:52,322
It's... it's quiet
and it's peaceful,

197
00:12:52,452 --> 00:12:55,194
no one to bother us.

198
00:12:55,325 --> 00:12:57,501
You can rest there.

199
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:02,549
And then when you're
feeling better,

200
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,813
we'll go to our
place in the city.

201
00:13:05,944 --> 00:13:07,641
Okay?

202
00:13:07,772 --> 00:13:09,208
How's that sound?

203
00:13:12,864 --> 00:13:14,474
Sounds nice.

204
00:13:39,978 --> 00:13:41,022
Sedatives.

205
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,415
I want you to rest.

206
00:13:44,765 --> 00:13:46,506
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

207
00:13:46,637 --> 00:13:49,553
Thank you for everything,
Doctor.

208
00:13:49,683 --> 00:13:51,381
Ready to go?
Yeah.

209
00:14:13,403 --> 00:14:14,621
It's so beautiful.

210
00:14:14,752 --> 00:14:17,058
How could I forget this view?

211
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:17,972
You're right about that.

212
00:14:18,103 --> 00:14:20,322
It is beautiful.

213
00:14:20,453 --> 00:14:22,455
And that's a great start.

214
00:14:25,066 --> 00:14:26,503
I'm gonna get a coffee,
you want anything?

215
00:14:29,331 --> 00:14:30,463
I'll be right back.

216
00:14:48,481 --> 00:14:50,352
Honey!

217
00:14:50,483 --> 00:14:52,093
I, um, was just looking for you

218
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,923
because I, uh, missed you.

219
00:14:56,054 --> 00:14:57,664
Well, we're gonna be there soon.

220
00:14:57,795 --> 00:15:01,276
We should probably
get going, okay?

221
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,349
Let's go.

222
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,133
...on the lower deck.

223
00:15:40,446 --> 00:15:41,969
So is it just us?

224
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,580
Yeah.

225
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,583
So no family, I don't have
anybody else?

226
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:48,193
Uh...

227
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:49,455
Well, there's Courtney,
your sister.

228
00:15:49,586 --> 00:15:51,675
She lives down in Kent.

229
00:15:51,805 --> 00:15:53,546
Oh, well, maybe we
should call her.

230
00:15:53,677 --> 00:15:54,852
She might be worried.

231
00:15:54,982 --> 00:15:57,028
No, I called her when you
were in the hospital.

232
00:15:57,158 --> 00:16:00,248
What did she say?

233
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:02,990
You two haven't
spoken in a while.

234
00:16:03,121 --> 00:16:05,645
Really?

235
00:16:05,776 --> 00:16:07,038
Don't worry.

236
00:16:07,168 --> 00:16:08,343
We've got each other.

237
00:16:10,694 --> 00:16:11,999
Listen, before we head home,

238
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,697
we should probably pick a few
things up at the market.

239
00:16:32,498 --> 00:16:35,109
What is it, what's wrong?

240
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,850
I don't know if this is
such a good idea.

241
00:16:36,981 --> 00:16:38,330
Maybe I should
go sit in the car.

242
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,637
If it's about the little girl,
she's just being a kid.

243
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:41,942
Okay?

244
00:16:42,073 --> 00:16:43,509
Okay.

245
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,816
I... I really, I really don't
feel comfortable in here.

246
00:16:45,946 --> 00:16:47,600
Sweetheart, okay, we'll just
grab a couple things,

247
00:16:47,731 --> 00:16:49,733
we'll be off in a second, okay?

248
00:16:49,863 --> 00:16:52,257
Okay, can you make it fast?
You got it.

249
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:53,301
Now, I'm just
gonna go grab something.

250
00:16:53,432 --> 00:16:55,739
Are you okay to stand here

251
00:16:55,869 --> 00:16:57,654
while I do that?

252
00:16:57,784 --> 00:17:00,482
I'll be back before you miss me.

253
00:17:00,613 --> 00:17:01,788
Hurry.

254
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:04,574
Okay.

255
00:17:04,704 --> 00:17:06,401
You're gonna be okay, I promise.

256
00:17:26,508 --> 00:17:28,467
Oh, my God!

257
00:17:28,598 --> 00:17:30,425
There you are!

258
00:17:30,556 --> 00:17:32,340
You have no idea

259
00:17:32,471 --> 00:17:34,604
how worried I've been about you.

260
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:37,215
I'm sorry, do I...

261
00:17:37,345 --> 00:17:38,738
I don't know.

262
00:17:38,869 --> 00:17:40,131
You don't...

263
00:17:40,261 --> 00:17:42,960
It's me, Melissa.

264
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,223
Mel?

265
00:17:45,353 --> 00:17:46,659
Melissa.

266
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,617
I heard about what
happened to you.

267
00:17:47,747 --> 00:17:50,576
Are... are you okay?

268
00:17:50,707 --> 00:17:52,360
I'm sorry, I don't remember you.

269
00:17:52,491 --> 00:17:53,884
Oh, sweetheart.

270
00:17:54,014 --> 00:17:54,972
Where did you go?

271
00:17:55,102 --> 00:17:56,190
I was looking for you.

272
00:17:56,321 --> 00:17:57,888
Hi, Melissa.

273
00:17:58,018 --> 00:17:59,585
What happened to her?

274
00:17:59,716 --> 00:18:01,326
We're not sure, exactly.

275
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:04,938
She went out on the boat
and somehow fell overboard.

276
00:18:05,069 --> 00:18:07,158
I always warn
her about the boat.

277
00:18:07,288 --> 00:18:10,727
Thank goodness you're alive.

278
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:13,686
It's okay, honey,
this is Melissa.

279
00:18:13,817 --> 00:18:15,732
You guys are best friends.

280
00:18:19,126 --> 00:18:22,652
You really don't
remember me, do you?

281
00:18:22,782 --> 00:18:26,220
I'm sorry, I'm sure
it'll come back to me.

282
00:18:26,351 --> 00:18:28,179
Can we go now?
Yeah.

283
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:29,789
Are you guys gonna be
in town for a while?

284
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,486
Yeah, we're just gonna go
up to the cabin and hang out

285
00:18:31,617 --> 00:18:33,445
until things get back to normal.

286
00:18:33,575 --> 00:18:34,576
Is there anything I can do?

287
00:18:34,707 --> 00:18:36,535
No, we just need some
healing time.

288
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,668
Okay.

289
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:40,408
Take care of yourself, okay?

290
00:19:08,741 --> 00:19:10,134
Anything familiar?

291
00:19:12,702 --> 00:19:14,704
Mmm, I don't know, sort of.

292
00:19:14,834 --> 00:19:17,054
It's like I've
seen it all before,

293
00:19:17,184 --> 00:19:20,448
but I don't know where or when.

294
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:22,450
That's a pretty good sign.

295
00:19:22,581 --> 00:19:23,495
Sounds like there's a few things

296
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:26,019
rattling around in
there trying to get out.

297
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,586
I was thinking it might be
a good idea for you to

298
00:19:27,717 --> 00:19:28,892
spend some time with Melissa,

299
00:19:29,022 --> 00:19:31,024
maybe bring back some memories.

300
00:19:47,693 --> 00:19:49,216
Welcome home.

301
00:19:49,347 --> 00:19:52,959
This is our vacation house?

302
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,569
You decorated it.

303
00:20:14,894 --> 00:20:17,070
How do we afford this place?

304
00:20:17,201 --> 00:20:20,291
Oh, it was practically a steal.

305
00:20:20,421 --> 00:20:21,814
A lot of blood, sweat and tears

306
00:20:21,945 --> 00:20:24,469
went into this place, but...

307
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:27,211
yeah, I do all right.

308
00:20:27,341 --> 00:20:28,342
Do I work?

309
00:20:28,473 --> 00:20:29,996
Yeah, tech support.

310
00:20:30,127 --> 00:20:33,652
You work from home, helping
your clients by remote.

311
00:20:33,783 --> 00:20:37,177
I hope that memory comes back.

312
00:20:37,308 --> 00:20:38,831
I'm just gonna grab
the groceries and the bag

313
00:20:38,962 --> 00:20:41,312
out of the car.

314
00:20:41,442 --> 00:20:43,401
Yeah, I'd like to roam around
a little bit by myself.

315
00:20:43,531 --> 00:20:45,185
That's a good idea.

316
00:20:45,316 --> 00:20:47,318
Holler if you need
anything, okay?

317
00:22:14,187 --> 00:22:15,667
Hi.

318
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,325
I was thinking,
it's a beautiful day outside.

319
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,113
Might be a good idea
to go for a walk.

320
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,514
How you doing?

321
00:22:36,644 --> 00:22:39,952
I feel great.

322
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:43,173
I kinda thought this
would make you feel better.

323
00:22:43,303 --> 00:22:45,958
It's beautiful, I wanna
take in every little detail.

324
00:22:46,089 --> 00:22:47,046
Really?

325
00:22:47,177 --> 00:22:48,700
I was kinda hoping we
could pick up the pace

326
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,397
for the last mile.

327
00:22:50,528 --> 00:22:51,877
Yeah, go ahead.

328
00:22:52,008 --> 00:22:52,965
Really?

329
00:22:53,096 --> 00:22:55,098
No problem,
I'll meet you at home.

330
00:22:55,228 --> 00:22:56,447
Okay, well, just...

331
00:22:56,577 --> 00:22:59,145
You follow the path until it
gets you to the base, okay?

332
00:22:59,276 --> 00:23:01,104
You sure?
Yeah, go ahead.

333
00:23:27,478 --> 00:23:30,133
Michael?

334
00:23:30,263 --> 00:23:32,787
Michael!

335
00:23:32,918 --> 00:23:34,833
Michael!

336
00:23:34,964 --> 00:23:35,965
Hello?

337
00:23:38,402 --> 00:23:39,664
Hello?

338
00:23:46,323 --> 00:23:47,498
Are you okay?

339
00:23:47,628 --> 00:23:48,455
I heard shouting.

340
00:23:48,586 --> 00:23:50,109
I...

341
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,328
I got lost.

342
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:53,678
I... didn't know where I was.
Honey!

343
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:54,984
I told you to follow the trail.

344
00:23:55,114 --> 00:23:58,552
It would have taken you
straight back to the base.

345
00:23:58,683 --> 00:24:00,598
Oh, sweetheart, sweetheart,
I'm so sorry.

346
00:24:00,728 --> 00:24:02,208
I never should have left you.

347
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:07,735
Can we go home now?

348
00:24:07,866 --> 00:24:09,085
Of course.

349
00:24:20,096 --> 00:24:21,880
Need any help?

350
00:24:22,011 --> 00:24:24,056
Drink and chop.

351
00:24:24,187 --> 00:24:26,058
Could you wash these for me?

352
00:24:26,189 --> 00:24:27,755
Thank you.

353
00:24:42,988 --> 00:24:45,425
That was delicious.

354
00:24:45,556 --> 00:24:48,080
I'm glad to see your
taste buds haven't changed.

355
00:24:48,211 --> 00:24:50,517
You know, I...

356
00:24:50,648 --> 00:24:52,128
made that the very
first time I cooked for you.

357
00:24:52,258 --> 00:24:53,651
That is your favorite.

358
00:24:53,781 --> 00:24:55,566
Well, you certainly
are a good cook.

359
00:24:55,696 --> 00:24:58,830
And you said that the first
time I cooked for you, too.

360
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,527
Really, tell me about it.

361
00:25:00,658 --> 00:25:02,399
Oh, God.

362
00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:04,444
Um...

363
00:25:04,575 --> 00:25:06,229
Well, it was Valentine's Day

364
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:08,579
and we were supposed to
go out for dinner,

365
00:25:08,709 --> 00:25:11,712
but some jackass
forgot to make reservations.

366
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,758
Ouch!

367
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:15,151
Yeah, well, I can't be expected
to remember everything.

368
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:17,283
I had candy and I
had the flowers, so...

369
00:25:17,414 --> 00:25:18,502
What were they?

370
00:25:18,632 --> 00:25:19,851
Orchids.

371
00:25:19,981 --> 00:25:22,984
You love orchids.

372
00:25:23,115 --> 00:25:26,858
And I also got you
a little bear.

373
00:25:26,988 --> 00:25:30,035
Oh, you got me a bear?

374
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:32,820
So I just went to
the pantry and got out

375
00:25:32,951 --> 00:25:36,346
what I had and...
there it was.

376
00:25:36,476 --> 00:25:38,478
Very nice.

377
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,325
What's wrong?

378
00:25:59,456 --> 00:26:01,240
I just need a little time.

379
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,289
Take all the time you need.

380
00:26:56,687 --> 00:26:57,601
Brooke?

381
00:27:44,213 --> 00:27:45,649
Brooke, you okay?

382
00:27:53,961 --> 00:27:55,267
Look out, look out,
look out, look out!

383
00:28:03,884 --> 00:28:05,016
I'm sorry.

384
00:28:05,146 --> 00:28:08,411
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

385
00:28:08,541 --> 00:28:10,891
I was trying to
make you breakfast.

386
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,676
Pancakes?

387
00:28:14,982 --> 00:28:16,897
That's all I could remember.

388
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,247
Sweetheart, it's all right,
it's all right.

389
00:28:18,377 --> 00:28:20,292
Was there somebody at the door?

390
00:28:20,423 --> 00:28:22,729
I didn't get there in time.

391
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,078
I'm so sorry.

392
00:28:24,209 --> 00:28:26,646
Honey, honey, it's okay.

393
00:28:26,777 --> 00:28:29,170
Okay, how about I take you
out for breakfast, okay?

394
00:28:31,608 --> 00:28:32,913
Okay.

395
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,741
Okay, why don't you get dressed

396
00:28:34,872 --> 00:28:36,308
and I'll be right up.

397
00:28:44,534 --> 00:28:46,492
I was looking at
the pictures in the hallway.

398
00:28:50,975 --> 00:28:52,716
Oh.

399
00:28:52,846 --> 00:28:55,284
Yeah, you were rearranging
them before the accident.

400
00:28:55,414 --> 00:28:57,155
I don't know where you
put them, so I just left it.

401
00:29:00,332 --> 00:29:03,857
I'm sorry, I just feel alone.

402
00:29:03,988 --> 00:29:04,858
I understand.

403
00:29:04,989 --> 00:29:06,382
I'm sorry about Courtney.

404
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:11,952
Why aren't we talking?

405
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,214
I don't really know.

406
00:29:13,345 --> 00:29:14,390
You two just
haven't gotten along

407
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,131
since your parents died.

408
00:29:17,262 --> 00:29:21,484
I was hoping that maybe when
things calmed down a bit,

409
00:29:21,614 --> 00:29:23,660
you could invite
her up to the house.

410
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,575
Do you think she'd come?

411
00:29:25,705 --> 00:29:27,316
I don't know, but we can try.

412
00:29:43,201 --> 00:29:46,030
I think that car
is following us.

413
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,553
What?

414
00:29:47,684 --> 00:29:50,600
The car behind us, they were
following us last night.

415
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:52,906
Sweetheart, there's
nobody following us.

416
00:29:53,037 --> 00:29:54,255
Who is it?

417
00:29:54,386 --> 00:29:56,214
Maybe if I just
make a turn up here.

418
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,111
I'm Detective Wagner.

419
00:30:24,242 --> 00:30:25,852
This is Detective Hanson.

420
00:30:25,983 --> 00:30:27,114
We're with the PD.

421
00:30:27,245 --> 00:30:28,507
Okay, how can I help you?

422
00:30:28,638 --> 00:30:29,900
Yeah, can we see some
identification?

423
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:32,250
Sure.
Why didn't you pull over?

424
00:30:32,381 --> 00:30:33,382
Well, that's 'cause I didn't
know you guys

425
00:30:33,512 --> 00:30:35,035
were police officers.
Sure.

426
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,472
Step out of the car.

427
00:30:38,865 --> 00:30:39,997
It's okay.

428
00:30:43,043 --> 00:30:44,480
That way.

429
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:48,919
Listen, my fiancée
just had an accident.

430
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:50,007
We're a little on edge here.

431
00:30:50,137 --> 00:30:51,617
I see a strange car
following us,

432
00:30:51,748 --> 00:30:53,880
and I don't know what to think.

433
00:30:54,011 --> 00:30:55,404
Uh-huh.

434
00:30:58,885 --> 00:31:00,452
You mind telling me
what this is all about?

435
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:04,238
Where were you the night
your fiancée

436
00:31:04,369 --> 00:31:05,979
disappeared, Mr. Coleman?

437
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,546
Home.

438
00:31:07,677 --> 00:31:09,548
And I was waiting
for her to come home.

439
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,202
Did you speak with
anybody during that time?

440
00:31:11,332 --> 00:31:13,117
Anybody that can corroborate
that you were there?

441
00:31:13,247 --> 00:31:14,727
No, I didn't.

442
00:31:14,858 --> 00:31:15,989
Are you implying that I had
something to do with that?

443
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,383
Any phone calls?

444
00:31:18,514 --> 00:31:20,777
No, I didn't speak with anybody.

445
00:31:20,907 --> 00:31:22,474
You have any idea why she would
have been on that boat?

446
00:31:22,605 --> 00:31:24,650
Well, we use it a lot.

447
00:31:24,781 --> 00:31:26,522
She likes to go out on it
sometimes and clear her head.

448
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:27,610
It's peaceful.

449
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,915
In the middle of the night?

450
00:31:29,046 --> 00:31:30,003
Well, maybe the storm
came up after she left.

451
00:31:30,134 --> 00:31:31,265
I really don't know.

452
00:31:31,396 --> 00:31:32,223
Listen, you're
welcome to speak with her,

453
00:31:32,353 --> 00:31:34,443
but I'm not sure how much

454
00:31:34,573 --> 00:31:35,705
she's gonna be able to tell you...
We heard.

455
00:31:35,835 --> 00:31:38,838
We already spoke with
Dr. Kaplan at County.

456
00:31:38,969 --> 00:31:40,927
Okay, well, then you guys
know as much as everyone.

457
00:31:41,058 --> 00:31:42,668
One more thing,
Mr. Coleman.

458
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,541
Dr. Kaplan mentioned
something about some bruises.

459
00:31:47,934 --> 00:31:49,893
Okay, I will tell you
exactly what I told her.

460
00:31:50,023 --> 00:31:51,895
Tennis.

461
00:31:52,025 --> 00:31:53,897
Brooke is outdoors a lot.

462
00:31:54,027 --> 00:31:55,812
Have you ever hit your
fiancée, Mr. Coleman?

463
00:31:55,942 --> 00:31:57,944
No, I haven't.

464
00:31:58,075 --> 00:32:00,251
And I wouldn't do
anything to hurt her.

465
00:32:00,381 --> 00:32:04,124
Well, please call
us if you have any...

466
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,953
useful information,
anything at all.

467
00:32:07,084 --> 00:32:08,172
I got it.

468
00:32:08,302 --> 00:32:11,131
Number's on the card.

469
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,959
All right, thank you.

470
00:32:24,144 --> 00:32:25,668
What did they want?

471
00:32:25,798 --> 00:32:26,973
They were just following up
on the accident.

472
00:32:27,104 --> 00:32:28,322
Procedure.

473
00:32:28,453 --> 00:32:29,715
It's nothing.

474
00:32:33,502 --> 00:32:34,981
What were we sitting here for?

475
00:32:44,643 --> 00:32:46,384
Hello, Brooke.

476
00:32:46,515 --> 00:32:50,083
I hear we had a little accident.

477
00:32:50,214 --> 00:32:52,782
Do you remember me at all?

478
00:32:52,912 --> 00:32:54,871
You look familiar.

479
00:32:55,001 --> 00:32:56,350
Well, that's a good start.

480
00:32:56,481 --> 00:32:57,700
I'm Dr. Richard Alvarez.

481
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,745
I'm an old friend of Michael's.

482
00:32:59,876 --> 00:33:00,920
The best thing about amnesia

483
00:33:01,051 --> 00:33:03,662
is you're always
meeting new friends.

484
00:33:03,793 --> 00:33:06,752
Well, I'm glad you haven't
lost your sense of humor.

485
00:33:06,883 --> 00:33:08,580
Now, I don't want
you to feel embarrassed

486
00:33:08,711 --> 00:33:11,757
or ashamed of your condition.

487
00:33:11,888 --> 00:33:14,020
We're all here to
get you through this.

488
00:33:14,151 --> 00:33:16,370
Get you back to where
you belong.

489
00:33:16,501 --> 00:33:18,459
Now, Michael tells me you've
been experiencing nightmares.

490
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:22,159
Want to tell me about those?

491
00:33:22,289 --> 00:33:24,378
There are little
flashes of memories.

492
00:33:24,509 --> 00:33:27,512
They don't make much sense.

493
00:33:29,122 --> 00:33:30,776
Just kind of random, really.

494
00:33:30,907 --> 00:33:34,475
Oh, believe me,
they're anything but.

495
00:33:34,606 --> 00:33:35,999
What I think is going on here

496
00:33:36,129 --> 00:33:39,002
is your brain is trying to
piece together a puzzle

497
00:33:39,132 --> 00:33:41,613
to help you understand
what happened that night.

498
00:33:41,744 --> 00:33:43,397
And that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

499
00:33:43,528 --> 00:33:46,444
I'm gonna help you take
details out of these flashes,

500
00:33:46,575 --> 00:33:48,577
help you put the pieces together

501
00:33:48,707 --> 00:33:49,969
so you can get back to normal

502
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,972
and you two can get on
with your lives.

503
00:33:53,103 --> 00:33:54,408
Thank you.

504
00:33:57,803 --> 00:33:59,631
So, Brooke, can you tell me
about these flashes?

505
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,418
I'm running.

506
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:06,551
Scared, I...

507
00:34:09,467 --> 00:34:11,164
Being chased by somebody.

508
00:34:11,295 --> 00:34:13,558
Who?

509
00:34:13,689 --> 00:34:14,733
I don't know.

510
00:34:14,864 --> 00:34:17,823
Somebody... I can't
really see who it is.

511
00:34:21,174 --> 00:34:23,002
There's nobody...

512
00:34:23,133 --> 00:34:24,830
there to help me.

513
00:34:29,052 --> 00:34:31,445
Whenever I get to a safe place,

514
00:34:31,576 --> 00:34:33,143
he's there and he stops me.

515
00:34:36,102 --> 00:34:37,756
It's like he's...

516
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:42,892
...always there,
waiting for me.

517
00:34:50,116 --> 00:34:52,641
He hits me and...

518
00:34:55,513 --> 00:34:56,688
...there's a girl.

519
00:34:56,819 --> 00:35:01,127
She's running
through the woods and...

520
00:35:01,258 --> 00:35:05,044
she's scared and, uh...

521
00:35:05,175 --> 00:35:07,525
she's...

522
00:35:07,656 --> 00:35:09,396
she's hiding from somebody.

523
00:35:09,527 --> 00:35:12,051
I... I don't know.

524
00:35:18,405 --> 00:35:19,711
I don't know.

525
00:35:19,842 --> 00:35:22,932
I know this is hard for you.

526
00:35:23,062 --> 00:35:27,197
The mind works in strange ways.

527
00:35:27,327 --> 00:35:28,807
Some memories rise to
the surface

528
00:35:28,938 --> 00:35:30,766
while others just dissipate.

529
00:35:33,943 --> 00:35:36,946
These childhood memories, it's...

530
00:35:37,076 --> 00:35:40,253
it's your subconscious trying
to tell you something.

531
00:35:40,384 --> 00:35:42,516
Next time you
have one of these visions,

532
00:35:42,647 --> 00:35:43,735
try not to focus on what it is,

533
00:35:43,866 --> 00:35:46,738
but try to
understand what it's about.

534
00:35:46,869 --> 00:35:49,654
Look for small details.

535
00:35:49,785 --> 00:35:51,482
What's in the background?

536
00:35:51,612 --> 00:35:52,962
What people are wearing,
a hat, a handbag,

537
00:35:53,092 --> 00:35:54,311
things like that.

538
00:35:54,441 --> 00:35:56,792
The place you're in.

539
00:35:56,922 --> 00:35:58,315
It's these small details

540
00:35:58,445 --> 00:36:00,970
that are the key to
you remembering

541
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,973
who you are,
the people around you

542
00:36:04,103 --> 00:36:07,150
and what happened that night.

543
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,109
Any one thing can
bring on a flood of memories.

544
00:36:13,286 --> 00:36:14,723
That make any sense to you?

545
00:36:19,902 --> 00:36:22,948
Thank you, Doctor.

546
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:25,690
Call me Richard.

547
00:36:25,821 --> 00:36:27,257
Well, thank you, Richard.

548
00:36:27,387 --> 00:36:29,085
Any time.

549
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:38,790
That wasn't so bad, was it?

550
00:36:38,921 --> 00:36:39,965
Maybe he's right.

551
00:36:40,096 --> 00:36:42,489
Maybe I'm looking at things
in the wrong way.

552
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,882
Listen, I'm gonna have to
drop you off at home.

553
00:36:44,013 --> 00:36:45,754
I'm late,
I've gotta meet a client.

554
00:36:47,843 --> 00:36:48,887
Oh.

555
00:36:49,018 --> 00:36:50,802
Someone's gotta
pay the mortgage.

556
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:55,285
What is it you do again?

557
00:36:55,415 --> 00:36:57,026
Marketing.

558
00:36:57,156 --> 00:36:58,418
And if I can get this bid,

559
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,680
we're gonna be set for a while.

560
00:36:59,811 --> 00:37:01,073
Okay.

561
00:37:01,204 --> 00:37:03,380
You know, maybe I should
go back to work, too.

562
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:06,296
That's not a bad idea.

563
00:37:06,426 --> 00:37:08,994
If I could remember enough.

564
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:11,344
I really don't wanna leave you.

565
00:37:14,391 --> 00:37:15,435
That's okay.

566
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:16,523
I'll... I'll visit Melissa.

567
00:37:16,654 --> 00:37:18,395
I should have her number.

568
00:37:18,525 --> 00:37:20,005
That's not a bad idea.

569
00:37:20,136 --> 00:37:22,399
I won't be long.

570
00:37:22,529 --> 00:37:23,966
I love you.

571
00:37:43,986 --> 00:37:46,727
How's the recovery?

572
00:37:46,858 --> 00:37:48,729
Taking it moment to moment.

573
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,384
So you don't remember anything?

574
00:37:54,213 --> 00:37:55,824
Little things, like...

575
00:37:55,954 --> 00:37:57,608
I see something and I know it's

576
00:37:57,738 --> 00:38:01,525
supposed to mean something
to me, but it just doesn't.

577
00:38:01,655 --> 00:38:02,787
Like my sister.

578
00:38:02,918 --> 00:38:04,528
Michael says we don't get along,

579
00:38:04,658 --> 00:38:06,878
but I have no idea why.

580
00:38:07,009 --> 00:38:08,140
You're...

581
00:38:08,271 --> 00:38:10,186
you're really lucky to
have someone like him.

582
00:38:10,316 --> 00:38:11,317
Yeah, he's really great.

583
00:38:11,448 --> 00:38:13,929
He, um...

584
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:16,105
But, you know, I don't
even remember how we met.

585
00:38:16,235 --> 00:38:18,759
It's like living with
a complete stranger.

586
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:20,196
The video store.

587
00:38:20,326 --> 00:38:21,675
What?

588
00:38:21,806 --> 00:38:23,242
That's how you guys met,
the video store.

589
00:38:23,373 --> 00:38:27,246
You guys were fighting
over the last copy of some DVD,

590
00:38:27,377 --> 00:38:30,206
and he suggested that you
guys watch it together.

591
00:38:30,336 --> 00:38:31,207
You're kidding.

592
00:38:31,337 --> 00:38:32,643
No, no.

593
00:38:32,773 --> 00:38:34,993
Love works in mysterious ways.

594
00:38:44,002 --> 00:38:46,700
You okay?

595
00:38:46,831 --> 00:38:48,789
Brooke?

596
00:38:53,446 --> 00:38:55,144
Are you okay?

597
00:38:59,757 --> 00:39:02,238
Come on, let's go.

598
00:39:02,368 --> 00:39:04,240
Where are we going?

599
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,983
Brooke, what are you doing?
I'm sorry, excuse me.

600
00:39:08,113 --> 00:39:08,897
I'm sorry.

601
00:39:09,027 --> 00:39:11,682
Mind your own business.

602
00:39:11,812 --> 00:39:13,162
Brooke!

603
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:22,084
Who was that guy?

604
00:39:22,214 --> 00:39:23,737
I don't know.

605
00:39:23,868 --> 00:39:25,696
He gives me the creeps.

606
00:39:25,826 --> 00:39:27,828
Then let's just go.

607
00:39:31,528 --> 00:39:33,269
Is that the boat?

608
00:39:33,399 --> 00:39:34,661
Yeah, it is.

609
00:39:34,792 --> 00:39:36,663
I heard they towed it
in this morning.

610
00:39:36,794 --> 00:39:38,317
You're lucky it
didn't hit the banks.

611
00:39:41,538 --> 00:39:43,496
What is it?

612
00:39:43,627 --> 00:39:45,107
It's nothing.

613
00:39:47,326 --> 00:39:49,981
I just hope you
won't go out alone again.

614
00:39:50,112 --> 00:39:51,852
You know you can always call me.

615
00:39:57,641 --> 00:40:00,513
What was I doing
here that night?

616
00:40:00,644 --> 00:40:02,080
Clearing your head?

617
00:40:11,872 --> 00:40:13,526
I don't think I was alone.

618
00:40:16,703 --> 00:40:18,357
What are you talking about?

619
00:40:26,191 --> 00:40:27,801
There was somebody here
with me that night.

620
00:40:27,932 --> 00:40:28,977
Who?

621
00:40:29,107 --> 00:40:30,239
Who else was here?

622
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:34,286
Who else was there?

623
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,465
I don't know.

624
00:40:51,521 --> 00:40:53,262
Brooke!

625
00:40:53,392 --> 00:40:55,177
Brooke, I can't help you
unless you tell me.

626
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:15,762
I just need to get
a hold of myself.

627
00:41:15,893 --> 00:41:17,590
I can't work.

628
00:41:17,721 --> 00:41:18,939
I can't work.

629
00:41:20,941 --> 00:41:22,813
tta get a hold of myself.

630
00:41:22,943 --> 00:41:25,076
I've gotta... calm down.

631
00:41:28,427 --> 00:41:29,559
If just...

632
00:41:29,689 --> 00:41:31,996
I gotta just relax.

633
00:42:13,646 --> 00:42:15,170
Where would I have put them?

634
00:42:34,493 --> 00:42:36,278
God, sweetheart!

635
00:42:36,408 --> 00:42:38,758
I'm so sorry, I wasn't...
I wasn't thinking.

636
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:41,500
Oh, baby, oh,
I'm sorry I scared you.

637
00:42:45,722 --> 00:42:48,290
It's okay.

638
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,075
It's okay.

639
00:42:51,206 --> 00:42:54,557
How was your day with Melissa?

640
00:42:54,687 --> 00:42:57,037
It was good, we had a nice chat.

641
00:42:59,301 --> 00:43:01,041
That's good.

642
00:43:01,172 --> 00:43:04,871
We took a walk in town.

643
00:43:05,002 --> 00:43:06,699
We saw the boat.

644
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:08,701
Good.

645
00:43:08,832 --> 00:43:11,095
Spark any memories?

646
00:43:11,226 --> 00:43:13,010
Anything come back to you?

647
00:43:13,141 --> 00:43:15,447
Not really.

648
00:43:15,578 --> 00:43:16,579
I tried to do some work,

649
00:43:16,709 --> 00:43:19,147
but I guess I'm not really
ready to go back yet.

650
00:43:19,277 --> 00:43:21,801
Well, we'll work on that.

651
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:24,935
There was one thing.

652
00:43:25,065 --> 00:43:26,719
While I walked past the store,

653
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:30,636
something about a bag.

654
00:43:30,767 --> 00:43:34,292
A bag?
What kind of bag?

655
00:43:34,423 --> 00:43:36,599
It was a suitcase.

656
00:43:36,729 --> 00:43:39,079
Hmm, I wonder what that means.

657
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:43,910
Do you wanna talk to
Richard about it?

658
00:43:44,041 --> 00:43:46,609
Remember what he said
about the small details?

659
00:43:46,739 --> 00:43:47,871
It could be important.

660
00:43:48,001 --> 00:43:50,134
I don't think Richard's
interested in my subconscious

661
00:43:50,265 --> 00:43:52,223
telling me I need to go
on a shopping spree.

662
00:43:52,354 --> 00:43:55,879
No, no, remember what
Dr. Alvarez said.

663
00:43:56,009 --> 00:43:58,490
The answers are in the details.

664
00:43:58,621 --> 00:44:02,712
You focus on an object, even
if it seems insignificant.

665
00:44:02,842 --> 00:44:06,019
You start there and you
work your way backwards.

666
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:07,630
It's just a suitcase.

667
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,066
No, no, that must be your mind

668
00:44:09,197 --> 00:44:10,633
trying to tell you something.

669
00:44:10,763 --> 00:44:14,376
Come on, just tell
me about the suitcase.

670
00:44:14,506 --> 00:44:16,508
I'd rather not do this now.

671
00:44:21,905 --> 00:44:23,472
Brooke, this could be important.

672
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,825
Come on.

673
00:44:28,955 --> 00:44:30,174
Tell me about the suitcase.

674
00:44:30,305 --> 00:44:32,872
Close your eyes.

675
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:36,528
What color is it?

676
00:44:36,659 --> 00:44:37,921
It's brown.

677
00:44:40,576 --> 00:44:41,968
It has...

678
00:44:42,099 --> 00:44:45,450
big... buckles.

679
00:44:45,581 --> 00:44:48,061
They're large.

680
00:44:48,192 --> 00:44:49,933
Gold.

681
00:44:50,063 --> 00:44:52,022
What's inside?

682
00:44:52,152 --> 00:44:54,285
Clothes.

683
00:44:54,416 --> 00:44:56,026
It's dark, it's hard to see.

684
00:44:56,156 --> 00:44:57,506
What else is inside?

685
00:44:57,636 --> 00:44:58,594
I don't know.

686
00:44:58,724 --> 00:45:00,204
It's...

687
00:45:00,335 --> 00:45:02,511
It's...

688
00:45:02,641 --> 00:45:04,861
I can't see...
Concentrate.

689
00:45:09,169 --> 00:45:10,867
I don't remember anymore.

690
00:45:10,997 --> 00:45:12,260
It's okay.

691
00:45:14,697 --> 00:45:15,915
I thought we were having
a breakthrough there,

692
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,787
I just didn't
want to lose momentum.

693
00:45:20,703 --> 00:45:21,878
Maybe later.

694
00:45:22,008 --> 00:45:23,619
Okay.

695
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:29,625
I was thinking that maybe later

696
00:45:29,755 --> 00:45:32,105
we could get a bottle of wine

697
00:45:32,236 --> 00:45:33,846
and sit by the fire.

698
00:45:33,977 --> 00:45:38,198
We could talk more about
this if you want to.

699
00:45:38,329 --> 00:45:42,594
I don't really
wanna do that tonight.

700
00:45:42,725 --> 00:45:44,379
It's been a long day.

701
00:45:56,304 --> 00:45:58,175
I'm just gonna go upstairs
and curl up in bed.

702
00:46:36,996 --> 00:46:39,477
I'm sorry, I just need
a little time.

703
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:45,614
Take all the time you need.

704
00:47:39,798 --> 00:47:42,192
I had another
weird dream last night.

705
00:47:42,322 --> 00:47:43,411
Really?

706
00:47:43,541 --> 00:47:45,935
What was it about?

707
00:47:46,065 --> 00:47:47,284
I don't know, but I'd really
like to talk to

708
00:47:47,415 --> 00:47:49,808
Dr. Alvarez about it.

709
00:47:49,939 --> 00:47:52,158
Um... yeah,
I'm sorry.

710
00:47:52,289 --> 00:47:53,725
I forgot to tell you.

711
00:47:53,856 --> 00:47:55,292
I spoke with Richard yesterday.

712
00:47:55,423 --> 00:47:58,513
He's going out of town
for a few days.

713
00:47:58,643 --> 00:47:59,818
Oh.

714
00:48:02,865 --> 00:48:04,519
More work?

715
00:48:04,649 --> 00:48:05,868
Yeah, I gotta go back into town.

716
00:48:05,998 --> 00:48:08,174
This client is
really busting my hump.

717
00:48:08,305 --> 00:48:09,175
Can I come with you?

718
00:48:09,306 --> 00:48:12,657
I could really use
some fresh air.

719
00:48:12,788 --> 00:48:14,529
Sure.

720
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:48,911
Well, something tells me
you haven't forgotten

721
00:48:49,041 --> 00:48:52,958
how to use a credit card.

722
00:48:53,089 --> 00:48:54,699
I'll be back to pick you up
in about an hour.

723
00:48:54,830 --> 00:48:56,266
Okay.

724
00:50:06,205 --> 00:50:07,337
Anything she remembers.

725
00:50:07,467 --> 00:50:08,425
She could remember everything.

726
00:50:08,556 --> 00:50:10,209
She remembered the bag.

727
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,602
Look, I'm gonna be out of
town for a few days.

728
00:50:11,733 --> 00:50:12,734
Just be careful.

729
00:50:12,864 --> 00:50:15,040
I'm doing everything I can.

730
00:50:15,171 --> 00:50:17,695
Look, I need to show you
something.

731
00:50:17,826 --> 00:50:19,349
Come out to the car.
No, it's late.

732
00:50:19,479 --> 00:50:21,699
It's gonna take a second.

733
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:22,700
You hear something?

734
00:50:22,831 --> 00:50:24,093
Hmm?

735
00:50:24,223 --> 00:50:25,747
Come on.

736
00:50:37,236 --> 00:50:39,064
What was it?

737
00:50:39,195 --> 00:50:42,415
Nothing, I guess.

738
00:50:42,546 --> 00:50:44,200
I gotta go anyway,
I got an appointment.

739
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:45,680
I'll talk to you later.

740
00:50:57,517 --> 00:50:59,171
Detective Wagner.

741
00:50:59,302 --> 00:51:01,043
Hi, it's Brooke Harris.

742
00:51:01,173 --> 00:51:02,479
How can I help you,
Ms. Harris?

743
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:03,698
I think something's going on.

744
00:51:03,828 --> 00:51:05,874
I was wondering
if I could see you?

745
00:51:06,004 --> 00:51:07,092
Where are you?

746
00:51:07,223 --> 00:51:10,139
I'm outside a store,
it's called Highland Books.

747
00:51:10,269 --> 00:51:12,228
Okay.

748
00:51:12,358 --> 00:51:14,186
Meet me down by the docks
in ten minutes.

749
00:51:14,317 --> 00:51:15,579
Okay, thanks.

750
00:51:20,453 --> 00:51:21,498
How's your head?

751
00:51:21,629 --> 00:51:23,543
Well, the pain is gone,

752
00:51:23,674 --> 00:51:26,938
but my memory is still
a little hazy.

753
00:51:27,069 --> 00:51:28,287
So what's going on?

754
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:30,420
Why were you following us
yesterday?

755
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:31,726
Why do you wanna know?

756
00:51:31,856 --> 00:51:34,598
Just tell me.

757
00:51:34,729 --> 00:51:37,427
We're just trying to
solve the case.

758
00:51:37,557 --> 00:51:40,735
Is my fiancé a suspect?

759
00:51:40,865 --> 00:51:43,085
Michael is a person
of interest, but...

760
00:51:45,348 --> 00:51:48,046
But what?

761
00:51:48,177 --> 00:51:50,614
How much do you remember about
your relationship with him?

762
00:51:50,745 --> 00:51:53,008
Not much.

763
00:51:53,138 --> 00:51:54,400
Why?

764
00:51:54,531 --> 00:51:56,576
Do you think he did it?

765
00:51:56,707 --> 00:51:58,230
He doesn't have a solid alibi,

766
00:51:58,361 --> 00:52:00,493
and it wouldn't be
the first time.

767
00:52:00,624 --> 00:52:02,408
And there is something else.

768
00:52:02,539 --> 00:52:04,802
We asked around about
your engagement,

769
00:52:04,933 --> 00:52:09,328
and no one seems
to remember anything.

770
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,069
What the...

771
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,897
Our house, the ring.

772
00:52:13,028 --> 00:52:14,507
Dr. Kaplan said
she didn't see a ring

773
00:52:14,638 --> 00:52:18,033
in all your possessions.

774
00:52:18,163 --> 00:52:20,775
That's crazy, I mean,
what about Dr. Alvarez?

775
00:52:20,905 --> 00:52:22,428
What about... what about him?
Who?

776
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,430
He... Richard Alvarez,
my psychiatrist.

777
00:52:24,561 --> 00:52:26,432
He knows about it.

778
00:52:26,563 --> 00:52:29,827
We'll look into it, okay?

779
00:52:29,958 --> 00:52:32,395
I know how hard it is.

780
00:52:32,525 --> 00:52:35,180
Now, you mentioned
something was going on.

781
00:52:35,311 --> 00:52:38,488
Did you see anything
or hear anything?

782
00:52:38,618 --> 00:52:40,316
What's going on,
Ms. Harris?

783
00:52:40,446 --> 00:52:41,709
It's nothing.

784
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:45,495
Ms. Harris.

785
00:52:45,625 --> 00:52:47,410
I think that Michael

786
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:50,152
is keeping some things from me.

787
00:52:50,282 --> 00:52:51,631
Some things?

788
00:52:51,762 --> 00:52:54,460
Missing pictures,
stuff like that.

789
00:52:54,591 --> 00:52:56,767
I need you to think back
before the accident.

790
00:52:56,898 --> 00:52:59,727
Is there anything
you can think of?

791
00:52:59,857 --> 00:53:01,206
Like what?

792
00:53:01,337 --> 00:53:02,120
Abuse.

793
00:53:02,251 --> 00:53:05,080
No, what are you talking about?

794
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:07,473
Okay, I'm gonna be honest
with you, Ms. Harris.

795
00:53:07,604 --> 00:53:09,171
Unless you say otherwise,

796
00:53:09,301 --> 00:53:12,957
this is probably gonna end up
being filed under "accident."

797
00:53:13,088 --> 00:53:16,439
There are no
witnesses, you're not dead,

798
00:53:16,569 --> 00:53:18,876
and nothing's been stolen,
as far as we know.

799
00:53:19,007 --> 00:53:21,270
So the only person
who knows what happened

800
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,533
on that boat is you.

801
00:54:11,189 --> 00:54:12,147
Michael.

802
00:54:12,277 --> 00:54:14,714
Michael!

803
00:54:14,845 --> 00:54:15,803
You forgot this.

804
00:54:15,933 --> 00:54:16,978
Oh.

805
00:54:17,108 --> 00:54:19,371
Melissa, thank you.

806
00:54:40,566 --> 00:54:41,785
Sorry!

807
00:54:41,916 --> 00:54:43,439
Sorry!

808
00:54:52,491 --> 00:54:54,493
Oh, my God!

809
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,234
Oh, my God!

810
00:54:56,365 --> 00:54:57,975
Oh, my God,
Brooke, are you okay?

811
00:55:00,891 --> 00:55:02,980
Get in the car,
I'll take you home.

812
00:55:17,516 --> 00:55:19,214
You wanna talk about it?

813
00:55:19,344 --> 00:55:20,824
Not really.

814
00:55:24,741 --> 00:55:27,526
Look at you, you're shaking.

815
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:31,617
Okay, okay, I'I'sorry.

816
00:55:31,748 --> 00:55:34,272
Brooke...

817
00:55:34,403 --> 00:55:36,405
I know you don't remember
everything that happened

818
00:55:36,535 --> 00:55:38,624
and that you're going through
a rough time right now,

819
00:55:38,755 --> 00:55:41,932
but... we're best friends

820
00:55:42,063 --> 00:55:45,414
and we tell each other
everything.

821
00:55:45,544 --> 00:55:47,764
I just wanted to
get back to that.

822
00:55:47,895 --> 00:55:51,507
Is there something you'd
like to tell me?

823
00:55:51,637 --> 00:55:53,074
About what?

824
00:56:03,084 --> 00:56:05,651
What's going on
with you and Michael?

825
00:56:05,782 --> 00:56:07,175
Are you serious?

826
00:56:07,305 --> 00:56:08,611
There's nothing going on
between Michael and I.

827
00:56:08,741 --> 00:56:10,004
I saw you guys this afternoon.

828
00:56:10,134 --> 00:56:11,527
Brooke, I swear!

829
00:56:11,657 --> 00:56:13,485
There's nothing going...

830
00:56:13,616 --> 00:56:14,617
You're my best friend!

831
00:56:14,747 --> 00:56:16,401
Save it.

832
00:56:18,447 --> 00:56:20,753
Brooke!

833
00:56:20,884 --> 00:56:21,580
Brooke, what's going on?

834
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,234
You tell me what's going on.

835
00:56:27,282 --> 00:56:28,848
What happened?

836
00:56:32,374 --> 00:56:34,028
Oh, God.

837
00:56:38,423 --> 00:56:40,251
Sweetheart, where have you been?

838
00:56:40,382 --> 00:56:42,123
I've been worried
sick about you.

839
00:56:45,082 --> 00:56:47,563
Are you having fun with her?

840
00:56:47,693 --> 00:56:48,956
Her who?

841
00:56:49,086 --> 00:56:49,913
What are you talking about?

842
00:56:50,044 --> 00:56:51,915
Don't insult my intelligence!

843
00:56:52,046 --> 00:56:54,700
I saw you and Melissa together.

844
00:56:54,831 --> 00:56:56,659
You and my supposed best friend

845
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:58,617
that I don't even know.

846
00:56:58,748 --> 00:56:59,792
It isn't like that.

847
00:56:59,923 --> 00:57:02,186
Then what was it like?

848
00:57:02,317 --> 00:57:03,883
Have dinner with me tonight.

849
00:57:04,014 --> 00:57:05,711
Tonight, Le Bistro Provence.

850
00:57:05,842 --> 00:57:06,799
Just have dinner with me tonight

851
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:09,759
and I will explain everything.

852
00:57:09,889 --> 00:57:11,326
The Bistro Provence,
you love that place.

853
00:57:11,456 --> 00:57:13,371
Just have dinner
with me tonight,

854
00:57:13,502 --> 00:57:16,287
and I'll explain everything.

855
00:57:16,418 --> 00:57:17,985
Oh, God.

856
00:57:18,115 --> 00:57:21,901
Give me one reason to trust you.

857
00:57:22,032 --> 00:57:24,165
I'll give you plenty of
reasons if you just say yes.

858
00:57:29,213 --> 00:57:31,607
Please.

859
00:57:31,737 --> 00:57:33,043
Oh, God, okay.

860
00:57:55,109 --> 00:57:58,373
Brooke, sweetheart, we gotta go.

861
00:57:58,503 --> 00:57:59,852
Coming!

862
00:57:59,983 --> 00:58:02,377
Come on, honey, we're late.

863
00:58:02,507 --> 00:58:04,161
I'm coming!

864
00:58:27,489 --> 00:58:28,533
Thank you.

865
00:58:28,664 --> 00:58:30,057
Thank you.

866
00:58:39,979 --> 00:58:42,982
Tell me what's bothering you.

867
00:58:43,113 --> 00:58:46,551
I talked to Detective Wagner.

868
00:58:46,682 --> 00:58:48,553
Okay, what did she have to say?

869
00:58:48,684 --> 00:58:50,077
She said that nobody
she interviewed

870
00:58:50,207 --> 00:58:52,514
knew about our engagement

871
00:58:52,644 --> 00:58:56,300
and that Dr. Kaplan didn't
find a ring in my possessions.

872
00:58:56,431 --> 00:59:00,870
Do you have anything to
say about that?

873
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,263
Dr. Kaplan was right,

874
00:59:02,393 --> 00:59:03,525
there wasn't a ring
in your possessions.

875
00:59:03,655 --> 00:59:04,917
Okay.

876
00:59:05,048 --> 00:59:06,093
There wasn't a ring there

877
00:59:06,223 --> 00:59:09,226
because you weren't wearing one.

878
00:59:09,357 --> 00:59:10,706
You see, we'd had some problems

879
00:59:10,836 --> 00:59:14,188
and things weren't going all
that well, to be honest.

880
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:15,885
We had a fight
and you just took off.

881
00:59:16,015 --> 00:59:19,758
A fight about what?

882
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,804
I've learned over the past
couple of days

883
00:59:21,934 --> 00:59:25,677
that none of that matters.

884
00:59:25,808 --> 00:59:28,071
The only important thing
is that you're alive

885
00:59:28,202 --> 00:59:29,333
and that we're together.

886
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:38,473
Do you remember the last time
you wore that dress?

887
00:59:38,603 --> 00:59:41,128
It was the night I proposed
to you a year and a half ago.

888
00:59:41,258 --> 00:59:42,694
We were spending a weekend
in the city

889
00:59:42,825 --> 00:59:45,480
and we had dinner at this

890
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:51,007
rooftop restaurant
that was way too expensive.

891
00:59:51,138 --> 00:59:53,009
I love you so much.

892
00:59:56,055 --> 00:59:58,362
When you had your accident,

893
00:59:58,493 --> 00:59:59,885
I thought for the first time

894
01:00:00,016 --> 01:00:03,715
what life might be
like without you.

895
01:00:03,846 --> 01:00:06,762
You can ask Richard, I was...

896
01:00:06,892 --> 01:00:10,374
I was terrified.

897
01:00:10,505 --> 01:00:11,593
It was like I had
taken you for granted

898
01:00:11,723 --> 01:00:14,335
and I was gonna lose you.

899
01:00:31,265 --> 01:00:33,223
Please, will you take a look?

900
01:00:46,236 --> 01:00:47,585
I don't wanna wait anymore.

901
01:00:47,716 --> 01:00:50,893
I can't wait anymore.

902
01:00:51,023 --> 01:00:53,069
And Melissa thought
you'd like it.

903
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:53,939
A wedding ring.

904
01:00:54,070 --> 01:00:55,550
Oh, my God.

905
01:00:58,030 --> 01:01:01,382
I know we've never
set a date before,

906
01:01:01,512 --> 01:01:03,949
but I don't wanna risk
losing you ever again.

907
01:01:07,953 --> 01:01:09,085
I don't care if
it's just you and me

908
01:01:09,216 --> 01:01:11,479
on a beach somewhere.

909
01:01:15,439 --> 01:01:17,746
I feel like we've been
given a second chance

910
01:01:17,876 --> 01:01:20,183
at a life together...

911
01:01:20,314 --> 01:01:22,098
and I want you to be my wife.

912
01:01:25,188 --> 01:01:26,972
Brooke, will you be my wife?

913
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:33,240
I just...

914
01:01:33,370 --> 01:01:34,806
I don't know what to say.

915
01:01:34,937 --> 01:01:38,810
All this time I thought
that you and Melissa...

916
01:01:38,941 --> 01:01:41,422
She helped me pick it out.

917
01:01:41,552 --> 01:01:43,641
And believe me,
she spared no expense.

918
01:01:43,772 --> 01:01:45,252
No.

919
01:01:45,382 --> 01:01:46,731
She must think I'm horrible.

920
01:01:46,862 --> 01:01:47,993
You are.

921
01:01:48,124 --> 01:01:49,168
You're a horrible,
horrible person.

922
01:01:49,299 --> 01:01:52,998
That's exactly why I love you.

923
01:01:53,129 --> 01:01:55,653
I spoke to the minister,
and we can do it tomorrow

924
01:01:55,784 --> 01:01:57,481
at our house.

925
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,272
What do you say?

926
01:02:08,623 --> 01:02:12,148
Yes.

927
01:02:12,279 --> 01:02:13,758
Yes.

928
01:02:18,154 --> 01:02:18,981
I'll make all the arrangements.

929
01:02:19,111 --> 01:02:21,244
Nothing fancy, I promise.

930
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:28,382
Sweetheart, what's wrong?

931
01:02:36,259 --> 01:02:38,740
I just wish that
my sister would come.

932
01:02:42,396 --> 01:02:45,268
Let's...

933
01:02:45,399 --> 01:02:47,183
let's not worry about the past.

934
01:02:49,185 --> 01:02:52,362
A toast.

935
01:02:52,493 --> 01:02:55,539
To a prosperous
and beautiful future.

936
01:03:06,028 --> 01:03:08,160
Could you excuse me
for a minute?

937
01:03:25,003 --> 01:03:25,917
I couldn't help but overhear.

938
01:03:26,048 --> 01:03:27,832
Congratulations!

939
01:03:27,963 --> 01:03:29,094
Thank you very much.

940
01:03:29,225 --> 01:03:31,532
I always thought
you made a good couple.

941
01:03:31,662 --> 01:03:33,838
Oh, I'm sorry, do I know you?

942
01:03:33,969 --> 01:03:36,145
Oh, that's right,
I forgot about that...

943
01:03:36,275 --> 01:03:37,538
You know?

944
01:03:37,668 --> 01:03:38,887
That's all right.

945
01:03:39,017 --> 01:03:40,497
I work at the coffee shop.

946
01:03:40,628 --> 01:03:43,761
Double-shot hazelnut latte
with room for extra cream.

947
01:03:43,892 --> 01:03:44,936
That's very good.

948
01:03:45,067 --> 01:03:46,982
Ha-ha, like an elephant.

949
01:03:47,112 --> 01:03:48,810
I remember when my husband
and I got engaged,

950
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:51,160
I was terrified.

951
01:03:51,290 --> 01:03:52,814
We were already engaged.

952
01:03:52,944 --> 01:03:55,556
Oh.

953
01:03:55,686 --> 01:03:59,821
Yeah, we're just making
plans for the date.

954
01:03:59,951 --> 01:04:01,431
You two were engaged?

955
01:04:01,562 --> 01:04:04,434
Wow, I... I had no idea.

956
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:41,732
I never want either
of us to forget

957
01:04:41,863 --> 01:04:43,430
how much we love each other.

958
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,656
Are you sure you wanna do this?

959
01:04:52,787 --> 01:04:54,266
I'm sure.

960
01:05:12,676 --> 01:05:14,156
Go get 'em.

961
01:07:10,881 --> 01:07:12,187
Hello, I'd like to speak
to someone in your

962
01:07:12,317 --> 01:07:16,234
marketing department.

963
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:17,801
Where might I find it?

964
01:07:21,457 --> 01:07:25,330
In your Tucson office, huh?

965
01:07:25,461 --> 01:07:26,505
No, it's okay.

966
01:07:26,636 --> 01:07:28,507
I'll call directly, thank you.

967
01:07:35,732 --> 01:07:36,864
Detective.

968
01:07:47,352 --> 01:07:49,485
He told me he was in marketing.

969
01:07:49,616 --> 01:07:53,054
I don't... I don't know.

970
01:07:53,184 --> 01:07:56,274
Am I crazy?

971
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:59,016
Look, I'll run these for prints

972
01:07:59,147 --> 01:08:01,149
and I'll also check employee
records for the company

973
01:08:01,279 --> 01:08:04,979
and we should be able to
get a positive ID, okay?

974
01:08:05,109 --> 01:08:06,241
What about Dr. Alvarez?

975
01:08:06,371 --> 01:08:07,938
Have you talked to him yet?
No.

976
01:08:08,069 --> 01:08:09,984
His answering service
said he was out of town.

977
01:08:10,114 --> 01:08:11,333
We left a message.

978
01:08:14,684 --> 01:08:15,990
Y'know, we just had
this wonderful dinner

979
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:19,558
and...

980
01:08:19,689 --> 01:08:21,822
everything is going so well.

981
01:08:26,522 --> 01:08:27,871
I guess I'd be silly

982
01:08:28,002 --> 01:08:30,308
to hope that I'm wrong
about all this.

983
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:32,223
No.

984
01:08:32,354 --> 01:08:33,877
I would, too.

985
01:08:44,148 --> 01:08:46,324
Sorry to hear about your accident.

986
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:47,499
Thank you.

987
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:49,850
Now, to answer your question,

988
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:52,983
I don't see mention of an
engagement on the account.

989
01:08:53,114 --> 01:08:55,986
Now, unless the account holder
specifically adds a non-spouse

990
01:08:56,117 --> 01:08:59,033
as beneficiary to the account,
they'd have no access.

991
01:09:02,297 --> 01:09:05,343
What about direct deposit?

992
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:08,695
Is there anything you can
show me with income?

993
01:09:08,825 --> 01:09:10,131
Whose?

994
01:09:10,261 --> 01:09:12,916
Michael.

995
01:09:13,047 --> 01:09:15,136
Like I told you, Michael
would need to be added.

996
01:09:18,443 --> 01:09:21,708
But it's his account.

997
01:09:21,838 --> 01:09:23,492
No, ma'am, it's your account.

998
01:09:25,799 --> 01:09:28,105
Ms. Harris,
this money is yours.

999
01:09:28,236 --> 01:09:29,890
You inherited it from
your parents.

1000
01:09:33,328 --> 01:09:37,114
Are there any
other accounts that...

1001
01:09:37,245 --> 01:09:39,247
Not with us.

1002
01:09:39,377 --> 01:09:40,335
You're sure he said...

1003
01:09:40,465 --> 01:09:44,295
Yes, he said Emerald Savings
& Trust, I'm sure.

1004
01:09:44,426 --> 01:09:46,733
I'm very, very sure about that.

1005
01:09:46,863 --> 01:09:49,083
So what you're saying is

1006
01:09:49,213 --> 01:09:51,302
that he can't get
access to this money

1007
01:09:51,433 --> 01:09:53,957
without my permission.

1008
01:09:54,088 --> 01:09:56,307
Not unless he was married to
you and something happened.

1009
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:03,967
Out of curiosity,

1010
01:10:04,098 --> 01:10:06,143
how much money
is in the account?

1011
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:05,899
What's wrong with you?

1012
01:11:06,029 --> 01:11:07,770
This isn't your car.
What do you want?

1013
01:11:07,901 --> 01:11:09,032
What I want?

1014
01:11:09,163 --> 01:11:12,079
It's me, Reynolds.

1015
01:11:12,209 --> 01:11:13,950
Your trainer.

1016
01:11:14,081 --> 01:11:15,169
I had an accident.

1017
01:11:15,299 --> 01:11:17,040
I'm having a difficult
time with faces.

1018
01:11:17,171 --> 01:11:18,302
Is that why you've been
running away from me?

1019
01:11:18,433 --> 01:11:21,784
You thought...

1020
01:11:21,915 --> 01:11:24,613
you thought I was
trying to hurt you?

1021
01:11:24,743 --> 01:11:27,485
You came to my house.

1022
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:29,009
We had an appointment.

1023
01:11:32,316 --> 01:11:36,625
I'm sorry, you must think
I'm losing my mind.

1024
01:11:36,755 --> 01:11:38,235
Hey, don't worry about it.

1025
01:11:38,366 --> 01:11:39,584
I'm...

1026
01:11:39,715 --> 01:11:42,196
I'm sorry I didn't know.

1027
01:11:42,326 --> 01:11:44,285
Hey.

1028
01:11:44,415 --> 01:11:46,809
Here.

1029
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:47,897
Call me when you're feeling up

1030
01:11:48,028 --> 01:11:50,465
to start working out
again, okay?

1031
01:12:20,538 --> 01:12:21,757
Hello?

1032
01:12:21,888 --> 01:12:23,585
Courtney?

1033
01:12:23,715 --> 01:12:26,153
Who is this?

1034
01:12:26,283 --> 01:12:29,286
Brooke.

1035
01:12:29,417 --> 01:12:32,072
I know that we haven't
talked in a while,

1036
01:12:32,202 --> 01:12:34,726
but I had an
accident on the boat.

1037
01:12:34,857 --> 01:12:36,206
Oh, Brooke.

1038
01:12:36,337 --> 01:12:40,080
Please, I can't remember...

1039
01:12:40,210 --> 01:12:43,561
I can't remember my house,

1040
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:45,172
my fiancé, Michael.

1041
01:12:45,302 --> 01:12:47,914
I can't remember why
you and I are fighting...

1042
01:12:48,044 --> 01:12:49,480
Wait a second, you didn't
actually get engaged

1043
01:12:49,611 --> 01:12:51,787
to that deadbeat, did you?

1044
01:12:51,918 --> 01:12:54,311
And I bet you didn't
get a prenup either.

1045
01:12:54,442 --> 01:12:57,358
Isn't marriage based on trust?

1046
01:12:57,488 --> 01:12:59,186
You cannot get engaged to a guy

1047
01:12:59,316 --> 01:13:01,928
that you have only
known a couple of months.

1048
01:13:02,058 --> 01:13:04,278
We've been engaged for
longer than that.

1049
01:13:04,408 --> 01:13:05,453
Listen, Brooke.

1050
01:13:05,583 --> 01:13:06,758
When Mom and Dad
gave us their estate,

1051
01:13:06,889 --> 01:13:08,586
they put their trust in us.

1052
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:11,676
I'll call you back.

1053
01:13:11,807 --> 01:13:13,113
Who was that on the phone?

1054
01:13:13,243 --> 01:13:15,463
Oh, it was just a wrong number.

1055
01:13:25,777 --> 01:13:27,649
Oh, check you out.

1056
01:13:30,217 --> 01:13:31,348
Hi.

1057
01:13:31,479 --> 01:13:32,349
Hi.

1058
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:33,698
I'm early for my appointment,

1059
01:13:33,829 --> 01:13:34,961
so I thought I'd come in

1060
01:13:35,091 --> 01:13:38,094
and check in
on the blushing bride.

1061
01:13:38,225 --> 01:13:39,791
Thanks for the company.

1062
01:13:39,922 --> 01:13:43,230
He is gonna be so happy.

1063
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,145
I was feeling the red,
what do you think?

1064
01:13:45,275 --> 01:13:48,017
I think go with it.

1065
01:13:48,148 --> 01:13:49,018
You know, I was thinking,

1066
01:13:49,149 --> 01:13:51,586
since you're gonna be
the only other girl,

1067
01:13:51,716 --> 01:13:54,067
you're gonna get the bouquet.

1068
01:13:54,197 --> 01:13:56,765
Yeah, yeah, I'd rather cut off
both my arms than catch it.

1069
01:13:58,375 --> 01:14:00,334
Oh, wait, y'know what,
I'm sorry, one second.

1070
01:14:00,464 --> 01:14:01,770
Maybe that's him.

1071
01:14:05,426 --> 01:14:07,297
Hello?

1072
01:14:07,428 --> 01:14:09,082
I had the station run those prints

1073
01:14:09,212 --> 01:14:10,779
and got a positive ID.

1074
01:14:10,909 --> 01:14:12,476
Michael Taylor.

1075
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:14,174
Born 1974.

1076
01:14:14,304 --> 01:14:16,915
Permanent residence
listed in Reno, Nevada.

1077
01:14:17,046 --> 01:14:18,917
And are you ready for this?

1078
01:14:19,048 --> 01:14:20,267
I found three restraining orders

1079
01:14:20,397 --> 01:14:22,312
against him from prior
girlfriends.

1080
01:14:22,443 --> 01:14:23,966
Really?

1081
01:14:24,097 --> 01:14:26,360
And he works for
the Bevlyn Bottling Company,

1082
01:14:26,490 --> 01:14:29,058
and according to the people
I spoke to,

1083
01:14:29,189 --> 01:14:32,583
you two were never engaged.

1084
01:14:32,714 --> 01:14:34,237
I'm sorry, Brooke.

1085
01:14:34,368 --> 01:14:37,284
Look, I'm on my way over now.

1086
01:14:37,414 --> 01:14:38,850
That's okay.

1087
01:14:38,981 --> 01:14:40,678
Didn't you hear
what I just said?

1088
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:43,072
The man could be dangerous.

1089
01:14:43,203 --> 01:14:46,510
I will take care
of that, thank you.

1090
01:14:46,641 --> 01:14:49,470
Brooke?

1091
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:50,775
Who was that?

1092
01:14:50,906 --> 01:14:54,301
Oh, it's just a wedding gift
that I was getting Michael.

1093
01:14:56,825 --> 01:14:57,565
What was that?

1094
01:14:57,695 --> 01:14:59,045
She hung up.

1095
01:14:59,175 --> 01:15:00,307
Does she have any idea
what kind of trouble

1096
01:15:00,437 --> 01:15:01,569
she's looking at?

1097
01:15:04,876 --> 01:15:05,573
I think I'm gonna go.

1098
01:15:05,703 --> 01:15:08,184
Wait.

1099
01:15:08,315 --> 01:15:11,840
I wanted to ask you a question.

1100
01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:13,624
A year and a half ago,

1101
01:15:13,755 --> 01:15:17,585
when Michael asked me
to marry him,

1102
01:15:17,715 --> 01:15:20,762
what did I say?

1103
01:15:20,892 --> 01:15:23,939
You said it was
the happiest day of your life.

1104
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:27,595
See ya.

1105
01:16:26,828 --> 01:16:29,178
Sweetheart, Brooke?

1106
01:16:32,050 --> 01:16:34,096
Honey, what's going on?

1107
01:16:34,227 --> 01:16:36,054
Oh, wow.

1108
01:16:36,185 --> 01:16:37,752
The minister's
gonna be here soon.

1109
01:16:37,882 --> 01:16:38,666
What's the hurry, honey?

1110
01:16:38,796 --> 01:16:40,407
It's just us.

1111
01:16:57,598 --> 01:16:59,817
Sweetheart, the minister's
gonna be here any minute.

1112
01:16:59,948 --> 01:17:02,168
He's not coming.
Why?

1113
01:17:02,298 --> 01:17:05,214
Come on, let's just do this
privately, you and I.

1114
01:17:05,345 --> 01:17:07,651
I like your thinking.

1115
01:17:07,782 --> 01:17:09,784
First, you know,
we should make a toast.

1116
01:17:09,914 --> 01:17:11,568
Don't you think?

1117
01:17:11,699 --> 01:17:12,961
Okay.

1118
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:20,055
To the future
Mr. and Mrs. Coleman.

1119
01:17:20,186 --> 01:17:22,449
I'll drink to that.

1120
01:17:22,579 --> 01:17:24,277
Mmm.

1121
01:17:24,407 --> 01:17:28,324
You remembered
my favorite label.

1122
01:17:28,455 --> 01:17:30,761
Yeah, I'm remembering
a lot of things.

1123
01:17:30,892 --> 01:17:33,982
What else do you remember?

1124
01:17:34,112 --> 01:17:36,289
Well, I went to the bank today

1125
01:17:36,419 --> 01:17:38,552
and, you know, they
told me the funniest thing.

1126
01:17:38,682 --> 01:17:40,031
Huh?
Yeah.

1127
01:17:40,162 --> 01:17:42,077
The money,
it turns out it's all mine.

1128
01:17:42,208 --> 01:17:42,991
You mean ours.

1129
01:17:43,121 --> 01:17:44,427
No, I mean mine.

1130
01:17:44,558 --> 01:17:46,690
But don't worry,
I've transferred it all

1131
01:17:46,821 --> 01:17:48,649
to an offshore account.
What?

1132
01:17:48,779 --> 01:17:50,390
Just to be safe.

1133
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:52,783
I thought that was
a really good idea.

1134
01:17:52,914 --> 01:17:54,655
Why would you do that?

1135
01:17:54,785 --> 01:17:55,743
Maybe for the same reason

1136
01:17:55,873 --> 01:17:58,311
you doctored every
photo in this house.

1137
01:17:58,441 --> 01:17:59,529
What?

1138
01:17:59,660 --> 01:18:02,315
For the reason you put
a ring on my finger

1139
01:18:02,445 --> 01:18:05,274
and made me believe
that we were engaged.

1140
01:18:05,405 --> 01:18:07,450
Sweetheart, I already
explained that.

1141
01:18:13,064 --> 01:18:16,372
Did you ever love me?

1142
01:18:16,503 --> 01:18:19,157
Let me tell you a little
story about a woman

1143
01:18:19,288 --> 01:18:22,117
who inherits
a large sum of money

1144
01:18:22,248 --> 01:18:24,075
from her parents.

1145
01:18:24,206 --> 01:18:25,338
She's a little lonely, you know,

1146
01:18:25,468 --> 01:18:28,341
she doesn't get out very
often, she works from home,

1147
01:18:28,471 --> 01:18:32,606
which makes her vulnerable.

1148
01:18:32,736 --> 01:18:37,350
And one day, along comes
a nice, handsome man.

1149
01:18:39,439 --> 01:18:43,747
But it turns
out he's not so nice.

1150
01:18:43,878 --> 01:18:47,316
She thinks that he loves her,

1151
01:18:47,447 --> 01:18:49,318
but all he really
wants is her money.

1152
01:18:49,449 --> 01:18:52,190
He wants to marry her,
but she refuses.

1153
01:18:52,321 --> 01:18:53,496
And when he becomes violent,

1154
01:18:53,627 --> 01:18:55,324
she tries to run away.

1155
01:18:55,455 --> 01:18:57,195
The next thing you know,

1156
01:18:57,326 --> 01:18:59,328
she wakes up in a hospital room,

1157
01:18:59,459 --> 01:19:01,678
without any of her
memories at all!

1158
01:19:01,809 --> 01:19:05,595
But he, he does everything
he can in his power...

1159
01:19:05,726 --> 01:19:10,034
to make her forget
how hard it all really was.

1160
01:19:10,165 --> 01:19:12,341
I mean, he goes so far,

1161
01:19:12,472 --> 01:19:13,908
he even gets a friend

1162
01:19:14,038 --> 01:19:16,606
to pretend to be
her psychiatrist.

1163
01:19:16,737 --> 01:19:18,565
I mean, what was his angle?

1164
01:19:18,695 --> 01:19:20,175
Was he gonna get
a cut of the money, too?

1165
01:19:24,310 --> 01:19:25,876
It's hard to build
a relationship

1166
01:19:26,007 --> 01:19:28,705
based on lies, isn't it?

1167
01:19:31,055 --> 01:19:32,622
Brooke?

1168
01:19:35,277 --> 01:19:36,757
Just in time.

1169
01:19:36,887 --> 01:19:38,236
She knows.

1170
01:19:38,367 --> 01:19:39,107
What?

1171
01:19:39,237 --> 01:19:40,674
She transferred the money.

1172
01:19:40,804 --> 01:19:42,240
Where?

1173
01:19:42,371 --> 01:19:43,720
Somewhere you can't touch it.

1174
01:19:43,851 --> 01:19:45,156
Offshore!

1175
01:19:45,287 --> 01:19:46,593
What's wrong with him?

1176
01:19:46,723 --> 01:19:47,681
Well, I guess
the sedatives I gave him

1177
01:19:47,811 --> 01:19:49,726
didn't mix well with
the champagne.

1178
01:19:49,857 --> 01:19:51,554
Where is it?

1179
01:19:51,685 --> 01:19:53,556
So you were the one
following me all the time

1180
01:19:53,687 --> 01:19:56,646
just waiting for the right
moment to make your move.

1181
01:19:57,821 --> 01:19:59,127
Where?

1182
01:19:59,257 --> 01:20:00,694
Go ahead and shoot me,
but unless we're married,

1183
01:20:00,824 --> 01:20:01,999
he's not gonna get a dime,

1184
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:03,871
which means you're not
gonna get a dime.

1185
01:20:04,001 --> 01:20:05,351
I should have killed you
the first time.

1186
01:20:05,481 --> 01:20:07,744
Oh, yeah, what were
you gonna do?

1187
01:20:07,875 --> 01:20:10,094
Kill me after the wedding
and live happily ever after

1188
01:20:10,225 --> 01:20:11,661
on all of my money?

1189
01:20:14,925 --> 01:20:19,060
Let me ask you a question.

1190
01:20:19,190 --> 01:20:20,366
Did he ever hit you?

1191
01:20:24,413 --> 01:20:25,632
Because there are
three women out there

1192
01:20:25,762 --> 01:20:29,462
with restraining orders
against him.

1193
01:20:29,592 --> 01:20:33,640
Is that the kind of guy
that you wanna be with?

1194
01:20:33,770 --> 01:20:36,120
I mean, it takes a real man
to hit a woman,

1195
01:20:36,251 --> 01:20:37,861
you know what I'm saying?

1196
01:20:37,992 --> 01:20:39,863
You know, I mean,
you really wanna be

1197
01:20:39,994 --> 01:20:40,821
with a real man...

1198
01:20:43,476 --> 01:20:46,174
You tell me how to
access the account.

1199
01:20:46,304 --> 01:20:47,567
You don't have a choice.

1200
01:20:47,697 --> 01:20:48,655
You think you're so smart, huh?

1201
01:20:48,785 --> 01:20:51,135
You think you got everything
figured out!

1202
01:20:51,266 --> 01:20:52,049
Let me kill her.

1203
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:53,355
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1204
01:20:53,486 --> 01:20:54,965
She's gonna tell us
where the money is.

1205
01:20:55,096 --> 01:20:56,837
You know what your
problem's always been?

1206
01:20:56,967 --> 01:20:58,752
You're too stubborn.

1207
01:20:58,882 --> 01:21:00,101
No.

1208
01:21:00,231 --> 01:21:01,668
She's not gonna tell
you anything.

1209
01:21:01,798 --> 01:21:03,539
Oh, yes she is.

1210
01:21:03,670 --> 01:21:05,541
She's gonna tell me
everything I wanna know

1211
01:21:05,672 --> 01:21:07,804
because she knows there's not
gonna be any second chances.

1212
01:21:22,602 --> 01:21:24,081
Brooke!

1213
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:25,692
Brooke!

1214
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:04,905
Brooke!

1215
01:22:05,035 --> 01:22:07,037
Brooke, baby!

1216
01:22:07,168 --> 01:22:08,386
Just tell me where
the accounts are,

1217
01:22:08,517 --> 01:22:09,823
you'll never see me again!

1218
01:22:11,868 --> 01:22:13,304
Brooke!

1219
01:23:57,626 --> 01:24:00,281
Now, where's my money?

1220
01:24:03,719 --> 01:24:06,156
The honeymoon's never quite
how you envisioned it, is it?

1221
01:24:20,170 --> 01:24:21,258
Yeah, it's over there.

1222
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:22,912
No weapons?

1223
01:24:23,043 --> 01:24:24,610
No, I'm just gonna bag this
and head back down.

1224
01:24:24,740 --> 01:24:26,089
Well, that's fine.

1225
01:24:26,220 --> 01:24:28,570
Let me get...

1226
01:24:28,701 --> 01:24:29,832
You're lucky.

1227
01:24:29,963 --> 01:24:33,096
A neighbor heard gunshots
and called it in.

1228
01:24:33,227 --> 01:24:35,229
We picked up
his friend, Dr. Alvarez,

1229
01:24:35,359 --> 01:24:38,928
trying to get out of town.

1230
01:24:39,059 --> 01:24:41,148
Who was he?

1231
01:24:41,278 --> 01:24:44,847
Some doctor that thought being
a con artist paid better.

1232
01:24:44,978 --> 01:24:46,153
He and Michael did this

1233
01:24:46,283 --> 01:24:49,243
to another girl
down in Portland,

1234
01:24:49,373 --> 01:24:50,940
but I think he's gonna
cut a deal,

1235
01:24:51,071 --> 01:24:52,855
help us put him away.

1236
01:24:52,986 --> 01:24:56,816
Hopefully he'll never
hurt anyone again...

1237
01:24:56,946 --> 01:24:59,862
thanks to you.

1238
01:24:59,993 --> 01:25:01,342
So what are you gonna do now?

1239
01:25:01,472 --> 01:25:03,257
Start over.

1240
01:25:03,387 --> 01:25:07,261
Rebuild my life.

1241
01:25:07,391 --> 01:25:10,046
Well... we're ready
to take your statement

1242
01:25:10,177 --> 01:25:11,961
when you're up to it, okay?

1243
01:25:12,092 --> 01:25:13,267
Thank you.

1244
01:25:13,397 --> 01:25:14,660
You're welcome.

1245
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:19,273
Brooke.

1246
01:25:19,403 --> 01:25:20,840
Are you okay?

1247
01:25:20,970 --> 01:25:24,278
I was so worried
after you called me.

1248
01:25:24,408 --> 01:25:26,193
Finding out about
the engagement...

1249
01:25:26,323 --> 01:25:28,499
You were right.

1250
01:25:28,630 --> 01:25:32,025
He just wanted the money.

1251
01:25:34,897 --> 01:25:37,595
And all this time, I just
thought you were jealous.

1252
01:25:37,726 --> 01:25:40,511
Maybe I was.

1253
01:25:40,642 --> 01:25:43,732
But not because of Michael.

1254
01:25:43,863 --> 01:25:46,909
'Cause I thought you had
something I've always wanted.

1255
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:48,302
I should have listened to you.

1256
01:25:48,432 --> 01:25:50,957
You were in love.

1257
01:25:51,087 --> 01:25:54,134
Sometimes that
makes us do crazy things.

1258
01:25:54,264 --> 01:25:56,702
I should have been
more supportive.

1259
01:25:56,832 --> 01:26:00,270
I was overly protective
about Mom and Dad's estate.

1260
01:26:00,401 --> 01:26:03,099
It almost cost me
my only sister.

1261
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:05,362
Can I come stay with you
for a couple of days?

1262
01:26:15,285 --> 01:26:16,286
I love you, sis.

1263
01:26:16,417 --> 01:26:17,810
I love you, too.

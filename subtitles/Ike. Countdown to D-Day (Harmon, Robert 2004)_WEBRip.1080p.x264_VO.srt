1
00:00:22,457 --> 00:00:24,721
Let me put this another way.

2
00:00:25,627 --> 00:00:30,724
If I am not given complete and
unfettered command of this situation...

3
00:00:31,433 --> 00:00:34,129
...you can,
if I may put it politely, sir...

4
00:00:34,302 --> 00:00:39,205
...take this job and put it where you
choose because I'll damn well quit.

5
00:00:39,374 --> 00:00:42,571
My other generals say it's unwise.
Too much responsibility for one man.

6
00:00:46,014 --> 00:00:47,572
Then find other generals.

7
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:51,007
Even your own other generals
say the same thing.

8
00:00:51,186 --> 00:00:53,677
Then I'll also find new ones.

9
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:58,715
I know who we're talking about here,
prime minister.

10
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:02,659
Your Air Marshal Harris
and my General Jimmy Spaatz.

11
00:01:04,032 --> 00:01:09,026
The RAF and the U.S. 8th Air Force
want to fight their own war.

12
00:01:09,204 --> 00:01:10,728
Win it with strategic bombing.

13
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:13,533
- They think...
- I know what they think, general.

14
00:01:15,176 --> 00:01:16,837
And it is very seductive.

15
00:01:17,145 --> 00:01:20,046
Continue the saturation bombing
of the Continent...

16
00:01:20,215 --> 00:01:22,206
...until the enemy's lost
his will to fight.

17
00:01:22,517 --> 00:01:24,985
Leave him defeated and dispirited...

18
00:01:25,153 --> 00:01:29,055
...before your invasion force
even sets foot ashore.

19
00:01:29,324 --> 00:01:31,588
If there's a shore to set foot on.

20
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,694
That kind of bombing would turn
Paris into a soccer field...

21
00:01:34,863 --> 00:01:36,956
...Holland into a swimming pool.

22
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:41,561
You were an infantry officer,
prime minister.

23
00:01:41,736 --> 00:01:45,331
We both know wars
can only be won on the ground.

24
00:01:46,374 --> 00:01:50,504
America did not send a million
of its finest men to stand by...

25
00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:56,207
...while faceless aircraft destroy the
Europe they're willing to die to save.

26
00:01:57,919 --> 00:02:03,482
And I don't believe you rallied
the British people to fight on, alone...

27
00:02:03,658 --> 00:02:06,388
...all these long years
to bear so much...

28
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:11,260
...only to see the great cities
of Europe become heaps of rubble.

29
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,761
We have to do more than liberate
Europe. We have to save it.

30
00:02:19,274 --> 00:02:24,211
We're soldiers, you and I.
There can only be one commander.

31
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:27,075
One conductor of this orchestra.

32
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:29,944
One supreme commander...

33
00:02:30,385 --> 00:02:33,081
...in the air, on the ground, at sea.

34
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:37,657
Or face interservice bickering,
clashing egos...

35
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:41,124
...conflicting operational deployments.

36
00:02:41,296 --> 00:02:44,094
One invasion, one commander.

37
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:55,900
A sampling of this morning's
editorial contribution:

38
00:02:58,446 --> 00:03:02,473
"As the Allies prepare for
our greatest challenge of the war...

39
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,584
...our leaders must not lose sight...

40
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:08,313
...of the true measure
of military leadership.

41
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:10,354
The victories
of General Montgomery...

42
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:14,359
...at El Alamein, Sicily and
every campaign he has undertaken...

43
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:17,464
...deserve prime consideration.

44
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:21,001
His hand is never far from such
forward momentum...

45
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:23,262
...as we have enjoyed in this war.

46
00:03:23,438 --> 00:03:26,965
No other general
can make that claim."

47
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:30,239
I could go on, but they're all
much of a muchness.

48
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:34,313
I don't deny Monty's achievements
as a field commander.

49
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:36,677
Whilst you can make no such claim.

50
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:46,549
Come, come, general. Don't take
offense. We're too close for that.

51
00:03:46,728 --> 00:03:50,687
Monty's not the man for this. We both
know it. Far too in love with his image.

52
00:03:51,499 --> 00:03:56,334
There's no shortage of men who would
like the title "supreme commander."

53
00:03:56,504 --> 00:04:03,000
Or even a part of it. And I...
We must identify each man...

54
00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:06,474
...and decide whether or not he is fit.

55
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:11,682
Harris?

56
00:04:11,853 --> 00:04:15,448
- Far too oblivious to destruction.
- Certainly not Spaatz.

57
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:19,658
Too flamboyant. Marshall?

58
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:22,523
You know F.D.R.
Won't let him leave Washington.

59
00:04:23,298 --> 00:04:26,461
And Mountbatten
is commanding in the Pacific.

60
00:04:36,411 --> 00:04:38,038
Then who?

61
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:45,850
Your own Mr. Roosevelt has his
doubts about a supreme commander.

62
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,717
I leave him to you, sir.
You'll be able to set him straight.

63
00:04:51,793 --> 00:04:58,289
No human in history has ever held
the power for which you now ask.

64
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:02,466
Not Caesar, not Alexander, no man.

65
00:05:02,637 --> 00:05:03,865
Ever.

66
00:05:08,076 --> 00:05:10,874
But this is Eisenhower
you're considering.

67
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:17,277
Is this relatively untried American
the right man for the job?

68
00:05:17,452 --> 00:05:20,546
- Very popular with the men.
- Irrelevant.

69
00:05:20,722 --> 00:05:23,520
Disciplined soldiers
fight at their leader's command...

70
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:25,591
...whoever that might be.

71
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,627
My victories that brought
us back North Africa...

72
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:31,959
...weren't won because I was popular
with the ordinary ranks.

73
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:36,161
No, I dare say. Brandy?

74
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:41,969
- No, thank you.
- Oh, I forgot your strict scruples.

75
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:48,413
General, let it not come
as a surprise to you.

76
00:05:49,751 --> 00:05:55,155
The decision is as good as made.
There will be no turning back.

77
00:05:55,323 --> 00:05:58,451
Eisenhower is to be
supreme commander.

78
00:05:58,626 --> 00:06:01,561
That is the consensus of the Allies.

79
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:06,132
I see. Politics first, is it?

80
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:08,801
Yes?

81
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,265
Yes, chief whip?

82
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:15,500
Time to prepare for the afternoon
question period, prime minister.

83
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:20,246
One last thought, prime minister.

84
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,906
There's more than one way
to skin this cat.

85
00:06:23,084 --> 00:06:24,676
If things remain as they are...

86
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:27,377
...let Eisenhower be
the de facto figurehead.

87
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:31,457
Just don't formalize it.
Leave some room for the rest of us.

88
00:06:31,626 --> 00:06:35,153
Oh, I'm sure you'll find some way
to maneuver, general.

89
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:38,662
You know my admiration
for your soldiering skills.

90
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,739
There are two kinds
of problem drinkers, chief whip.

91
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,708
Those who drink too much
and those who drink too little.

92
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:57,146
I believe it's a religious thing with
the general. Strict Methodist, I think.

93
00:06:57,318 --> 00:06:59,786
Oh, might be an asset.

94
00:07:00,655 --> 00:07:02,316
Way the odds
are on this thing...

95
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,051
...we could use somebody
on close terms with God.

96
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:28,472
Giving Monty a private audience?

97
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:30,913
You could call it that.

98
00:07:31,085 --> 00:07:32,746
Man's a pain in the ass.

99
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,219
Kind of megalomaniac who's got his
own ideas how to win this war.

100
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,450
He'll never accept you.
I admire Churchill much as any man...

101
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:43,188
...but not even he could sell that
without some sticking in the craw.

102
00:07:43,364 --> 00:07:46,891
Churchill's not there to sell.
His job is making decisions.

103
00:07:47,068 --> 00:07:48,899
Mine is to make them work.

104
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,561
Yeah, well, you're tough enough
to make it happen.

105
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:54,139
Even with the generals
and admirals he offended.

106
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:57,072
I'm glad you feel that way
because if we foul up...

107
00:07:57,245 --> 00:08:00,237
...we'll end up sharing
a supply desk in Washington.

108
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:05,646
You'd lose your operational rank.
They'd take away three stars.

109
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,051
- Remember '38 in the summer?
- Yeah.

110
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:12,317
Careers had stalled.
We figured we'd be passed over...

111
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:15,018
...and mustered out within a year.
- As colonels.

112
00:08:15,196 --> 00:08:18,393
- Yes, as colonels.
- So we'd still be ahead of the game.

113
00:08:20,101 --> 00:08:22,365
Now, tell me about the tanks
in the sand.

114
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:26,906
Those beaches aren't really sand.
They're pebble and rock.

115
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:29,739
Your 3:00 meeting is here.

116
00:08:30,144 --> 00:08:34,604
Your unfriendly friendly.
I'll slip out the back.

117
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,596
Tut-tut.

118
00:08:56,737 --> 00:09:02,698
Needlessly timid, if you ask me.
And I trust you are asking me.

119
00:09:02,877 --> 00:09:07,940
Of course. That's why we're here. For
a frank discussion, just you and me.

120
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:10,845
Good. Then I will be frank.

121
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:14,078
Like all battles,
this one will be won on the ground.

122
00:09:14,255 --> 00:09:17,782
But not necessarily by infantry men,
one foot at a time.

123
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:22,225
Armor can slash through first,
leaving infantry to consolidate gains...

124
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:26,594
...but that requires
a flexible master plan.

125
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:30,396
We might find a sudden lunge across
the low countries, a dagger aimed...

126
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:33,506
...at the heart of Berlin
could end the war by Christmas.

127
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:37,770
The concept for a broad landing
at Normandy has been approved.

128
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:40,209
Given the political sensibilities
involved...

129
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:42,144
...there's no going back on that.

130
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:46,776
You're the supreme commander.
The politics are your concern.

131
00:09:46,954 --> 00:09:49,218
My interest is
the most effective strategy...

132
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,290
...and tactical moves
to support it.

133
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:56,161
A massive invasion will be tipped to
Jerry's intelligence, we know that.

134
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,628
He'll be ready to defend across
a broad front.

135
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,599
A slashing blow will be harder for him
to concentrate his troops against...

136
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:03,998
...with any depth.

137
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:07,106
Unless the German knows where
the slashing blow is coming.

138
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:11,540
Then, as you put it,
with his intelligence alerted...

139
00:10:13,147 --> 00:10:15,308
You're being inflexible.

140
00:10:15,483 --> 00:10:18,008
I'm adhering to a master plan.

141
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:24,548
Once we have established beachhead,
we can reexamine our options.

142
00:10:25,026 --> 00:10:26,789
I see.

143
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:31,660
And as commander of all land forces,
I'll have my say in that reexamination?

144
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:33,995
Absolutely.

145
00:10:34,168 --> 00:10:38,730
Now, let me outline
my expectations...

146
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:41,500
...for your ground forces
once ashore.

147
00:10:41,676 --> 00:10:46,045
Here, the ground slopes easily.

148
00:11:08,903 --> 00:11:11,963
Sir, it wouldn't take
more than 15 minutes.

149
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:15,108
Fifteen minutes better spent
on real work, captain.

150
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:20,312
With respect, sir,
public relations is real work.

151
00:11:20,481 --> 00:11:22,608
I know you don't
have time for the press...

152
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:24,944
...but folks back home need
to know you.

153
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:26,746
Human face of the leader, sir.

154
00:11:26,921 --> 00:11:30,118
Mr. Roosevelt is their leader,
and mine.

155
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,486
- Yeah, but...
- Interview division commanders.

156
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,127
Try some platoon sergeants.

157
00:11:34,295 --> 00:11:36,661
What about my chief of staff,
General Smith?

158
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:40,361
What do you say, Beetle? Want
to show the world your human face?

159
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:42,331
Sorry, sir. I wasn't issued one.

160
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:48,639
This isn't MacArthur's HQ, where he
has to be at the center of everything.

161
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:50,572
We're a team here.

162
00:11:50,745 --> 00:11:54,146
So go get some publicity
for the running backs. That is all.

163
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,576
Yes, sir.

164
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:08,994
- He's arrived.
- I saw. I could hardly miss it.

165
00:12:14,502 --> 00:12:19,201
Beetle, he's brilliant,
but sometimes he acts like a child.

166
00:12:19,373 --> 00:12:21,398
Are you thinking
of sending him home?

167
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,839
Let's have him.

168
00:12:28,783 --> 00:12:30,045
He'll see you now.

169
00:12:30,785 --> 00:12:33,652
- You gonna keep the helmet on?
- Damn right.

170
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:57,138
I think you know why you're here.

171
00:12:57,311 --> 00:12:58,642
More or less.

172
00:12:58,813 --> 00:13:02,010
Some prep-head politician stateside
got pissed at the truth.

173
00:13:02,183 --> 00:13:06,210
That's neither more nor less, George.
It's damned ignorant.

174
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:11,851
"Anglo-Saxons to rule the postwar
world." What the hell is that?

175
00:13:12,026 --> 00:13:13,254
The straight skinny.

176
00:13:13,694 --> 00:13:16,128
When this is over,
it will be us and the Brits...

177
00:13:16,297 --> 00:13:18,231
...have to put
the world back together.

178
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,594
That's gonna come
as a surprise to Stalin...

179
00:13:20,768 --> 00:13:23,134
...who's losing millions
on the eastern front.

180
00:13:23,304 --> 00:13:25,363
Yeah, communism's for the next war.

181
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:28,804
Goddamn it, George. Shut up.

182
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:33,511
The Czechs are also in this war.

183
00:13:33,681 --> 00:13:37,447
And the Dutch and the Danes
and God knows who else.

184
00:13:39,053 --> 00:13:41,715
And above all...

185
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:43,413
...it's racialism.

186
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:46,751
It's the very thing we're fighting.

187
00:13:47,528 --> 00:13:51,555
I can't have my generals
spouting idiocy Hitler would applaud.

188
00:13:51,732 --> 00:13:56,533
Anglo-Saxon superiority? That's
exactly the kind of pigheaded crap...

189
00:13:56,704 --> 00:13:59,400
...that will make Stalin think
we are the next enemy.

190
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:03,835
Sometimes I think you don't have
the vaguest idea why we're fighting.

191
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:06,844
- That's not fair, Ike.
- It is if it's true.

192
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:12,852
I'm not sending a bunch of fresh
young kids from Iowa and California...

193
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:17,650
...and New York and Nebraska to die
on French beaches for the freedom...

194
00:14:17,825 --> 00:14:23,161
...of people they know nothing about
so we can establish a new racial order.

195
00:14:24,265 --> 00:14:28,258
I'm asking them to die
to prevent precisely that.

196
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:32,769
And they're ready to do it.
And that's why they're heroes.

197
00:14:34,508 --> 00:14:40,037
And why slapping a shell-shocked
soldier as a malingerer is never...

198
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:44,116
...never permissible!
Do you understand me, sir?

199
00:14:51,425 --> 00:14:53,416
You should know
that despite the fact...

200
00:14:53,594 --> 00:14:56,529
...that he doubts
your worthiness to command...

201
00:14:57,331 --> 00:15:01,199
...that General Marshall has left it
to me to decide how to handle this.

202
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:04,769
So I ask you again.
Do you understand?

203
00:15:10,878 --> 00:15:13,608
Sir, yes, sir.
I understand completely.

204
00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:20,980
I do, Ike. I swear I do.

205
00:15:21,789 --> 00:15:25,555
What I don't get, I'll study.
I promise.

206
00:15:26,327 --> 00:15:30,855
I swear, I promise. Just please...

207
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,361
...don't send me home.

208
00:15:35,436 --> 00:15:36,664
Please, Ike.

209
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:41,139
I couldn't bear to be in Washington
when the show starts.

210
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:44,209
Don't do that to me. I beg you.

211
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:47,808
Soldier to soldier, that I'll keep
my mouth shut. I promise you.

212
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:51,183
Soldier to soldier.

213
00:15:54,722 --> 00:15:56,485
Soldier to soldier.

214
00:15:59,927 --> 00:16:01,952
I wish it were that simple.

215
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:04,755
You were my mentor.

216
00:16:04,932 --> 00:16:08,732
My senior officer,
who told me once a long time ago...

217
00:16:09,503 --> 00:16:12,301
...that one day
I'd be giving him orders.

218
00:16:12,906 --> 00:16:17,206
Well, that day's come, George.
And that's the truth.

219
00:16:17,378 --> 00:16:19,437
Soldier to soldier.

220
00:16:25,586 --> 00:16:28,214
Last time, Georgie.

221
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:32,815
Last time.

222
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:35,423
Thank you.

223
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:56,413
Sir, may I return
to my headquarters now?

224
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:15,532
Gentlemen.

225
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:30,206
Played him like a violin.
Ate out of my hand, he did. Drive on.

226
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:38,381
- How'd it go?
- I'm keeping him on.

227
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:42,928
Probably thinks
he put one over on me.

228
00:17:43,097 --> 00:17:44,997
Hell, maybe he did.

229
00:17:45,966 --> 00:17:49,697
Let's keep him in Maidenhead,
commanding his fictitious army.

230
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:52,270
Now Rommel thinks he's my ace.

231
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:56,500
Besides, once we get ashore,
I'll need him...

232
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:59,304
...to command real tanks.

233
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,877
Traff, what you got?

234
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:04,873
Early estimates of airborne losses.

235
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:09,317
Assume perfect weather,
and we go with a full or half-moon.

236
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:13,950
No crosswind at the drop zone,
losses could be low as 8 percent.

237
00:18:14,695 --> 00:18:20,292
But should any of the elements turn
against us, casualties will spiral.

238
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:23,834
They might hit a quarter or more.

239
00:18:24,338 --> 00:18:25,805
One in four.

240
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,866
What's the split between
wounded and dead?

241
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:33,576
Oh, with paratroopers, one might
as well assume they're all dead.

242
00:18:34,014 --> 00:18:35,845
A wounded jumper is a cripple.

243
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:39,481
And we all know this enemy.

244
00:19:54,962 --> 00:19:56,896
I'm ahead of you.

245
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,928
What the hell time is it?

246
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:03,096
It's 0520.

247
00:20:05,606 --> 00:20:07,506
But you want to be woken for this.

248
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:10,572
In from Southwest Command,
just decoded.

249
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:21,349
All chiefs of staff
in the map room, 20 minutes.

250
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:24,350
No doubt in your mind about this?

251
00:20:24,524 --> 00:20:25,786
Afraid not.

252
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:30,726
The craft's scars could only be made
by Krupp Essen U-210 torpedoes.

253
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:33,263
Then the German
is right off the coast.

254
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:36,059
What about damage?
Too much for a loner.

255
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:39,000
Absolutely. This was a full pack.

256
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:42,073
In daylight, C-search patrols
can spot E-boats...

257
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:45,336
...as soon as they come
close enough to fire torpedoes.

258
00:20:45,512 --> 00:20:47,446
But at night, under radar...

259
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:51,880
Then what in damnation were men
doing out there after nightfall?

260
00:20:52,052 --> 00:20:54,714
Landing-craft drivers
were having a difficult time...

261
00:20:54,888 --> 00:20:56,913
...managing these new
duplex-drive craft.

262
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,422
They're fragile in anything
but good weather.

263
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:02,528
Division commander felt
they needed more experience.

264
00:21:02,696 --> 00:21:07,395
Then the man is a damned fool and
should be relieved of his command.

265
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:10,001
You won't find any
of my divisional commanders...

266
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,536
...playing silly buggers
with Jerry concealed.

267
00:21:12,706 --> 00:21:14,571
How many landing craft lost?

268
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:19,610
First estimates are at 11, possibly 12.
But we've only seen two or three hulls.

269
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,475
Any intercepted Jerry signals?

270
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:25,175
E-boat captains radioed Berlin,
claiming two dozen.

271
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:27,883
We went on the air
with a decodable signal...

272
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:30,182
...to Patton's fictitious army...

273
00:21:30,357 --> 00:21:32,518
...saying it lost five landing craft.

274
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:34,627
First reports back
from Signal Corps...

275
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:36,922
...indicate Jerry bought
the whole program.

276
00:21:37,097 --> 00:21:39,895
I'd be surprised if Jerry's
really buying the idea...

277
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:42,729
...that the bulk of our forces
are in the east.

278
00:21:42,903 --> 00:21:45,235
I wouldn't. Not with activity
in the southwest.

279
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:47,034
I take your point.

280
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:52,604
But we have fake tanks,
trucks and landing craft...

281
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:54,872
...deployed throughout
that entire region.

282
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:58,677
And our psychological
warfare squads in Norwich...

283
00:21:58,852 --> 00:22:02,253
...generate more radio traffic
than our entire force doubled.

284
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:05,491
They use a new magnetic wire
that records Morse messages...

285
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:08,457
...and repeats it night and day.
From what we monitor...

286
00:22:08,628 --> 00:22:12,120
...the Germans have moved
a full signal battalion to Dieppe...

287
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:13,926
...in order to sort it out.

288
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,696
We have Patton's HQ
in Maidenhead.

289
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:21,273
The enemy is certain he will be field
commander of any Allied invasion.

290
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:24,834
- They can't imagine anyone else.
- Well, hell.

291
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:29,471
If Hitler had half his wits about him,
he'd be on Monty's tail night and day.

292
00:22:32,652 --> 00:22:37,146
And there is no sign that the
3rd Air Fleet, the 16th Army...

293
00:22:37,324 --> 00:22:40,782
...or any of 16 panzer divisions
southward.

294
00:22:41,395 --> 00:22:42,623
I think we fooled them.

295
00:22:43,096 --> 00:22:46,429
He believes Patton's
fictitious army is real.

296
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:49,128
He's not really watching Normandy.

297
00:22:50,637 --> 00:22:53,606
- For now, at least.
- Precisely, for now.

298
00:22:53,774 --> 00:22:57,301
Rommel's no fool. Sooner or later,
he'll figure out there's a limit...

299
00:22:57,477 --> 00:23:00,002
...to the size of our force,
send flights...

300
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,341
...to inspect Patton's army
and discover...

301
00:23:02,516 --> 00:23:05,815
...that all his tanks and trucks
are nothing but papier-mâché.

302
00:23:05,986 --> 00:23:07,920
Tell me about these men we lost.

303
00:23:08,088 --> 00:23:12,582
And what is this duplex-drive problem
on the damn landing craft?

304
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,856
The DDs? Well, the men
call them Donald Ducks...

305
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:18,589
...because they're not
that easy to understand.

306
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:21,529
It takes practice to reach
the skill level necessary...

307
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:23,794
...to master the two output levels.

308
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:27,701
One for the high seas and the other
for soft landings on a beach.

309
00:23:27,874 --> 00:23:30,138
We were short
of the bloody things before.

310
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:34,035
That's an entire battalion's
passage gone.

311
00:23:34,214 --> 00:23:36,705
Could be a month before we
get replacement craft.

312
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:40,410
It's only 19 days to the half-moon
and the right high tide.

313
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:43,988
Look, if we can trick Rommel
for 19 days through to mid-May...

314
00:23:44,157 --> 00:23:47,149
...surely we can push him
to the next useful moon and tide.

315
00:23:47,828 --> 00:23:49,955
That would be June 5th, sir.

316
00:23:51,131 --> 00:23:55,864
All this dithering around is bloody
annoying, General Eisenhower.

317
00:23:56,036 --> 00:23:59,972
My men are ready to go.
I say the sooner the better.

318
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:04,839
Leaving it to June is a tremendous
risk. What if there's a storm?

319
00:24:05,011 --> 00:24:09,948
Then we've lost June. We have to put
it off to July. Six weeks to September.

320
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12,607
It's not enough to land the army.

321
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:14,879
We have to get tanks ashore,
get inland...

322
00:24:15,055 --> 00:24:17,683
...before the worst of
autumn weather slows us down.

323
00:24:17,858 --> 00:24:20,053
What can you give me in June,
Stagg?

324
00:24:21,328 --> 00:24:23,888
Expecting a fine
English summer, sir.

325
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,726
I mean, meteorology's a fair bit
of witchcraft...

326
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,664
...but all indications
are for one of our better Junes.

327
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:32,168
Three extra weeks means
at least 100 more LSTs.

328
00:24:32,706 --> 00:24:35,766
Give us more time to pulverize
the rail lines out of Germany.

329
00:24:35,942 --> 00:24:38,570
- And railheads in France.
- The men are impatient.

330
00:24:39,012 --> 00:24:41,105
- Dulls their itch.
- And sooner or later...

331
00:24:41,281 --> 00:24:44,944
...we won't be able to hide the size
of our force in the southwest.

332
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:49,114
May 19th or June 5th?

333
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,056
Or the fail-safe last chance in July?

334
00:24:53,226 --> 00:24:55,490
Mid-July.

335
00:24:56,096 --> 00:24:58,860
Leaving maybe eight weeks,
if there's an early frost...

336
00:24:59,032 --> 00:25:01,626
...to establish a beachhead
for half a million men.

337
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:03,393
How doable is that?

338
00:25:08,575 --> 00:25:09,803
That's what I thought.

339
00:25:09,976 --> 00:25:14,845
Please have it factored in for the
next meeting, gentlemen. Thank you.

340
00:25:24,457 --> 00:25:27,187
I know the reason you're here.

341
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,056
Of course, the loss of these men is...

342
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:35,590
Yes, of course. But I was referring
to your other reason.

343
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:37,999
Other reason?

344
00:25:38,171 --> 00:25:39,968
You have the advantage
over me, sir.

345
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,337
I certainly hope so. It's my job.

346
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:58,523
I am told you've committed to June.

347
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:00,655
Given up on a May landing.

348
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:04,629
I assume Monty kept you informed.

349
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:07,596
No names, no pack drill.

350
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:10,634
But of course, general,
you are in Britain.

351
00:26:10,804 --> 00:26:15,036
You must assume I have resources
to keep myself in the picture.

352
00:26:17,043 --> 00:26:21,036
And I understand
from Mr. Roosevelt...

353
00:26:21,214 --> 00:26:23,978
...that the additional time
will increase the number...

354
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:27,381
...of these newfangled landing craft.

355
00:26:27,954 --> 00:26:30,115
The president is my security leak?

356
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,951
Hardly.

357
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:36,153
But even if he were,
he is your superior.

358
00:26:36,329 --> 00:26:38,797
And my good friend and ally.

359
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:42,867
Never forget, general,
you serve at our pleasure.

360
00:26:44,137 --> 00:26:48,836
Then if it please you, sir,
we need to delay till June 4 or 5.

361
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:50,636
I'm promised excellent weather.

362
00:26:51,311 --> 00:26:53,643
By then, we will have
100 more landing craft.

363
00:26:53,813 --> 00:26:55,212
So...

364
00:26:55,849 --> 00:26:58,374
...the fate of our two great nations
comes down...

365
00:26:58,551 --> 00:27:02,510
...to things called LSTs
and Donald Ducks.

366
00:27:03,657 --> 00:27:09,687
Well, if it be so, so be it. And yes,
general, I accede to you once more.

367
00:27:09,863 --> 00:27:11,854
June it is.

368
00:27:12,565 --> 00:27:16,001
Good. Thank you.

369
00:27:26,413 --> 00:27:29,211
But that raises another problem, sir.

370
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:34,477
Further delay creates almost
unbearable pressure on our security.

371
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:38,090
We can't let the Germans sense
we're only making a feint at Calais.

372
00:27:38,258 --> 00:27:43,924
If Rommel moves his main force to
Normandy, we'd be stacking bodies.

373
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:48,324
There's only one way to be
certain that German spies...

374
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:51,265
...or loose lips don't stumble
across our activities...

375
00:27:51,438 --> 00:27:53,065
...and anticipate our moves.

376
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:56,675
That is to seal the coast across
the south of England and Wales...

377
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:58,708
...to all unauthorized traffic.

378
00:27:58,878 --> 00:28:00,743
Most of it is sealed already.

379
00:28:00,914 --> 00:28:03,906
I mean all of it.

380
00:28:04,084 --> 00:28:06,177
No civilian traffic whatsoever.

381
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:10,550
Are you mad, sir? Do you not
realize that no one in Britain...

382
00:28:10,724 --> 00:28:13,056
...lives more than
150 miles from the sea?

383
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,656
It is no accident that Britannia rules
the waves and all that business.

384
00:28:17,831 --> 00:28:21,130
We are a people whose entire destiny
is linked to the sea.

385
00:28:21,301 --> 00:28:24,395
Which is why you must now
turn your people away from it.

386
00:28:25,338 --> 00:28:26,828
Impossible.

387
00:28:27,006 --> 00:28:28,564
It might mean thousands...

388
00:28:29,676 --> 00:28:32,440
...tens of thousands
of young men's lives.

389
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:39,244
I will give you this, general.

390
00:28:39,786 --> 00:28:41,913
You know how to take charge.

391
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:44,815
It's not about power, sir.

392
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:50,196
It is simply the judicious use of the
responsibility you entrusted me with.

393
00:28:50,363 --> 00:28:55,824
Only under duress and your threats to
walk out. I'd have you remember that.

394
00:28:57,003 --> 00:28:58,595
Yes, sir.

395
00:29:12,218 --> 00:29:14,550
<i>The Ministry of Information</i>
<i>unedited footage...</i>

396
00:29:14,721 --> 00:29:17,349
<i>...spied by the 3rd Red army</i>
<i>Film Corps.</i>

397
00:29:17,524 --> 00:29:19,788
<i>The surrender of</i>
<i>the German 7th army.</i>

398
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,190
<i>Hitler refuses to allow</i>
<i>further withdrawal.</i>

399
00:29:23,363 --> 00:29:26,628
<i>Throws three panzer divisions</i>
<i>from the western front to the east.</i>

400
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,529
They're on the APC. Look at that.

401
00:29:28,701 --> 00:29:35,038
Three less we have to face. One
more reason to rethink a broad front.

402
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:38,905
Ride a dagger-thrust road
straight to Berlin.

403
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,847
And we'll have the French
to help us along.

404
00:29:44,384 --> 00:29:46,648
<i>Smuggled, unedited film</i>
<i>from Warsaw Ghetto...</i>

405

<i>...where Jews resist an entire</i>
<i>German army for six weeks.</i>

406
00:29:51,191 --> 00:29:55,389
Twice as long as the well-fed
French army in 1940.

407
00:29:55,562 --> 00:29:58,053
Don't count on them
to help us along.

408
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:03,991
<i>Supreme commander meets</i>
<i>with soldiers of the line.</i>

409
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:19,848
Give me five minutes.
I'll have tonight's feature ready.

410
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:22,681
- What have you got?
- <i>Sahara.</i>

411
00:30:22,856 --> 00:30:26,587
- Bogart wins the war in North Africa.
- Not bloody likely.

412
00:30:29,963 --> 00:30:31,191
I'll be off, then.

413
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:34,464
I'll walk you out.

414
00:30:35,635 --> 00:30:39,503
- It's supposed to be a good movie.
- Not much taste for cinema, myself.

415
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:42,641
Besides, never enough time
for preparation, is there?

416
00:30:44,978 --> 00:30:47,208
Well, we all need some recreation.

417
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,713
Movie once a week, let the hair down,
it seems to do the trick.

418
00:30:50,884 --> 00:30:54,786
If you say so. Although,
if you don't mind me saying so...

419
00:30:54,954 --> 00:30:59,220
...that jeering when you came on the
screen, a bit much, you know.

420
00:30:59,592 --> 00:31:01,082
Good-natured, as I see it.

421
00:31:01,561 --> 00:31:02,858
Undisciplined.

422
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:06,188
So is using
German troop movements...

423
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:08,926
...to push your plan
for a dagger thrust again.

424
00:31:09,936 --> 00:31:12,063
The broad assault
is a closed matter.

425
00:31:13,673 --> 00:31:16,369
I allow all my sub-commanders
latitude, general...

426
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,305
...but restraint is also a virtue.

427
00:31:19,846 --> 00:31:21,871
Yes, sir.

428
00:31:22,649 --> 00:31:24,617
Point taken.

429
00:31:46,873 --> 00:31:48,204
He looks cold.

430
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:50,140
Yeah.

431
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:54,410
But if we get our asses kicked, we
won't be walking across snowy tundra.

432
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,275
We'll have to swim back.

433
00:31:58,952 --> 00:32:03,582
Truth is, I wasn't looking at Napoleon.
I was thinking about the soldiers.

434
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,518
Johnny's graduating from the
academy this session. June 6th.

435
00:32:11,164 --> 00:32:12,563
Proud moment.

436
00:32:13,066 --> 00:32:15,057
Have your son succeed you
at West Point.

437
00:32:15,234 --> 00:32:17,702
Yeah, I can't believe
I won't be there.

438
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:20,202
Cheer him and shake his hand.

439
00:32:20,373 --> 00:32:23,399
You'll see him soon enough.
And when you do...

440
00:32:25,712 --> 00:32:27,236
Yeah.

441
00:32:28,414 --> 00:32:29,938
It stinks.

442
00:32:32,318 --> 00:32:33,979
It does.

443
00:32:34,153 --> 00:32:38,613
But any way you look at it,
we're getting off easy from this war.

444
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:41,652
I'll most likely live to see it over.

445
00:32:42,228 --> 00:32:45,664
And my son won't be in it
for as long as most.

446
00:32:45,832 --> 00:32:47,595
But on the other hand...

447
00:32:49,002 --> 00:32:51,061
...this war is still your burden.

448
00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:55,903
And the rest of us,
we're just supporting cast.

449
00:32:56,075 --> 00:32:57,975
If it's any comfort...

450
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:03,305
...so far, general, you are giving
one hell of a great performance.

451
00:33:05,685 --> 00:33:08,176
I don't think I needed
to hear my job described...

452
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:10,219
...quite like that, General Smith.

453
00:33:12,492 --> 00:33:15,586
I loved your crack at Monty
about the French.

454
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:19,294
Oh, thank you.
We bought them from Harrods.

455
00:33:19,465 --> 00:33:22,195
- Harrods?
- Oh, he splashed out.

456
00:33:23,536 --> 00:33:25,561
Wow, that is beautiful.

457
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:29,000
A lousy wine, Edgar.

458
00:33:29,175 --> 00:33:34,545
But not for long, huh? Soon be
downing the best French stuff.

459
00:33:34,714 --> 00:33:38,241
What do you say, Edgar? I reckon
four days from the beaches to Paris.

460
00:33:38,418 --> 00:33:40,648
- Get there on the 8th.
- I have no idea...

461
00:33:41,054 --> 00:33:44,080
...what you're talking about, Henry.
Nor do you, get it?

462
00:33:44,257 --> 00:33:47,658
Watch it, colonel.
Remember who you're talking to.

463
00:33:47,827 --> 00:33:50,887
Major general. Don't you
damn well forget it either, Henry.

464
00:33:51,064 --> 00:33:54,227
Come, Edith, it's time
we powdered our noses.

465
00:33:58,938 --> 00:34:01,498
Henry, you're a goddamned idiot.
Just button it up.

466
00:34:01,674 --> 00:34:05,269
What's the big deal? The whole
world will know soon enough.

467
00:34:08,114 --> 00:34:11,345
<i>It is a 100-to-1 shot because</i>
<i>it's more than the line of duty.</i>

468
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,512
<i>There's so little chance</i>
<i>of any us coming out of it.</i>

469
00:34:14,687 --> 00:34:16,382
<i>I ought to put it up to you.</i>

470
00:34:16,556 --> 00:34:19,889
<i>You all got families at home.</i>
<i>Wives, mothers and sweethearts.</i>

471
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:23,085
<i>I ain't got no one,</i>
<i>so it doesn't matter about me.</i>

472
00:34:23,262 --> 00:34:25,856
<i>I know how you feel about it.</i>

473
00:34:31,938 --> 00:34:36,170
He actually said, "June 4th,"
in the hotel grill?

474
00:34:36,342 --> 00:34:38,367
That place is packed
that time of night.

475
00:34:38,544 --> 00:34:40,068
What the hell was he thinking?

476
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:44,876
- He had too much to drink.
- Henry Miller is a major general.

477
00:34:45,051 --> 00:34:47,315
Entertaining guests
with inside knowledge...

478
00:34:47,487 --> 00:34:49,614
...is a betrayal of the men
he commands.

479
00:34:49,789 --> 00:34:51,279
Of course.

480
00:34:51,457 --> 00:34:52,981
How'd Chapman get onto this?

481
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:57,892
A junior officer from the 101st was at
the next table. He contacted his CO.

482
00:34:58,064 --> 00:35:01,227
- Well, did you speak to the officer?
- Yeah. Yeah.

483
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,028
A first lieutenant.
Young man from Philadelphia.

484
00:35:04,203 --> 00:35:07,400
Feels awful about the thing.
Didn't want to be thought a snitch.

485
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:10,539
But?

486
00:35:12,178 --> 00:35:15,306
But he said he commanded
a platoon of airborne infantry.

487
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:18,973
His chances were bad enough without
making it easier for the Krauts.

488
00:35:19,152 --> 00:35:24,556
Then he's a damn sight better
officer than Miller. And smarter.

489
00:35:27,393 --> 00:35:30,885
Henry was a roommate at West Point.

490
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:34,595
One of my closest friends.

491
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:41,199
You know, the word stayed closed.
No one really knows about it.

492
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:45,136
I do.

493
00:36:09,335 --> 00:36:11,098
At ease.

494
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:28,311
Ike, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I...

495
00:36:28,487 --> 00:36:31,718
- I don't know what got into me.
- I do.

496
00:36:34,961 --> 00:36:38,294
I swear, I'll never touch another drop.

497
00:36:39,799 --> 00:36:41,289
You're lying.

498
00:36:44,804 --> 00:36:48,103
- So, what will you do with me?
- What do you think?

499
00:36:49,308 --> 00:36:54,940
Oh, please. Ike, don't do this to me.

500
00:36:55,548 --> 00:36:59,450
We go back too far. We're old friends.
You can't cut me loose.

501
00:36:59,852 --> 00:37:03,151
It might be easier if we didn't
have so much history, Hank.

502
00:37:03,322 --> 00:37:07,691
But the stakes are way too big.
You'll have to go home immediately...

503
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,693
...and you won't be coming back.

504
00:37:10,863 --> 00:37:14,355
We both owe that to the men
who will be dead in a few weeks.

505
00:37:14,533 --> 00:37:19,869
I'll lose my operational rank.
I'll go home in disgrace, a major.

506
00:37:20,139 --> 00:37:22,107
You can't send me home.

507
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:27,042
You owe me something.
I'm part of the inner circle.

508
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,210
That's the worst thing
you could have said.

509
00:37:32,151 --> 00:37:37,453
There is no inner circle. Only those
who will live and those who will die.

510
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:40,555
And you don't seem to get that.

511
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,846
Send him home immediately.
Loss of theater rank.

512
00:38:05,885 --> 00:38:08,445
Try to keep him a colonel if you can.

513
00:38:08,621 --> 00:38:10,612
And on his record?

514
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:16,319
"Deemed more useful in HQ. Skills
not needed in theater of operation."

515
00:38:25,404 --> 00:38:28,567
The thing about all the power,
Beetle...

516
00:38:28,741 --> 00:38:31,073
...it isn't the big decisions
that weigh heavy.

517
00:38:31,243 --> 00:38:34,804
Hell, you can decide
to invade Russia at dinner.

518
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:38,313
Pick Waterloo for battle on a whim.

519
00:38:38,484 --> 00:38:42,818
It's the details. The small stuff.

520
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:47,550
It's easy to gamble
a million lives. What's hard...

521
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:52,987
...is to see how that can hurt
one single person.

522
00:38:53,566 --> 00:38:56,694
And if you can't keep that straight...

523
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:00,704
...hell...

524
00:39:01,474 --> 00:39:04,307
...you'll lose your humanity.

525
00:39:06,812 --> 00:39:08,245
Won't you?

526
00:39:10,316 --> 00:39:12,250
I couldn't say, sir.

527
00:39:26,132 --> 00:39:28,327
As you were.

528
00:39:30,403 --> 00:39:32,530
- Good morning, Beetle.
- Same to you.

529
00:39:32,705 --> 00:39:34,798
I thought you quit smoking.

530
00:39:34,974 --> 00:39:39,707
I'm trying. Ready for the big day?
It's the big moment.

531
00:39:39,879 --> 00:39:42,143
Anything good in the paper?

532
00:39:42,314 --> 00:39:43,804
No, not really.

533
00:39:45,751 --> 00:39:48,652
It's stateside,
but, hey, it's three days old.

534
00:39:50,356 --> 00:39:53,985
Walter, you're my chief of staff,
not my HQ censor.

535
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:03,466
"While Ike's a good administrator
and a good organizer...

536
00:40:03,636 --> 00:40:06,366
...he lacks the military flare
of a Montgomery...

537
00:40:06,539 --> 00:40:09,030
...or the audacity of a Patton.

538
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:14,305
Yet, for better or worse, he's the man
they call supreme commander."

539
00:40:19,952 --> 00:40:21,442
You know, Ike...

540
00:40:22,121 --> 00:40:24,612
...a little public relations
wouldn't do any harm.

541
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,655
Oh, it would, and you know it.

542
00:40:26,826 --> 00:40:30,694
We're surrounded by some of
the biggest swelled heads in history.

543
00:40:30,863 --> 00:40:33,957
My job is keeping them pulling
together in the same direction.

544
00:40:34,133 --> 00:40:39,264
I can't do that if I'm competing
with them for newspaper ink.

545
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:43,236
This is your plan. You developed it.

546
00:40:43,409 --> 00:40:48,176
You fought Churchill for it,
all the politicians, even F.D.R.

547
00:40:48,347 --> 00:40:51,714
No, this is your show.
The world ought to know it.

548
00:40:51,884 --> 00:40:55,980
Maybe. One day, but not this day.

549
00:40:56,155 --> 00:40:59,056
This day, we have
other fish to fry, general.

550
00:40:59,725 --> 00:41:03,126
- Now may I have some coffee?
- Yes, sir.

551
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:19,173
Oh, a point of principle, old man.

552
00:41:19,345 --> 00:41:22,837
A bad habit in my opinion.
Never been permitted in my HQ.

553
00:41:23,883 --> 00:41:26,943
Oh, all right, Monty,
if it's so damned important to you.

554
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,350
I did agree to use your ground
for this.

555
00:41:47,873 --> 00:41:52,901
Churchill makes the final decision
on what they buy. Only him.

556
00:41:53,078 --> 00:41:56,047
But don't oversell. He can smell
bull pucky a mile away.

557
00:41:56,215 --> 00:41:59,275
You are acquainted with Eisenhower,
an American cousin.

558
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:02,420
Yes. Good to see you again.

559
00:42:02,588 --> 00:42:06,581
Prime minister tells us we may have
great confidence in this undertaking.

560
00:42:06,759 --> 00:42:10,092
Oh, I never disagree
with Mr. Churchill, Your Majesty.

561
00:42:10,262 --> 00:42:12,423
Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth.

562
00:42:12,598 --> 00:42:15,123
How delighted we are
to see you again, general.

563
00:42:15,301 --> 00:42:17,792
We look forward
to our private luncheon next week.

564
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:20,632
As do I, ma'am. I thank you.

565
00:42:20,806 --> 00:42:24,037
General, if you please.

566
00:42:43,629 --> 00:42:45,597
Excuse me.

567
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:14,191
Your Majesties, Mr. Prime Minister...

568
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:18,023
...honored guests, dignitaries,
I'm Dwight Eisenhower...

569
00:43:18,197 --> 00:43:20,495
...commander in chief,
Supreme Headquarters...

570
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:24,534
...Allied Expeditionary Force,
European Theater of Operation.

571
00:43:24,703 --> 00:43:28,002
Just getting the title straight
is tiring enough.

572
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:31,304
So I will leave much
of today's business...

573
00:43:31,477 --> 00:43:36,039
...to my trusted and gifted
colleagues, brothers-in-arms.

574
00:43:36,215 --> 00:43:40,675
We are from different traditions,
different services...

575
00:43:40,853 --> 00:43:43,378
...but we are united in this crusade.

576
00:43:44,223 --> 00:43:48,717
We shall liberate Europe.
We shall restore freedom.

577
00:43:48,894 --> 00:43:51,260
We shall make the world
safe for democracy.

578
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:58,395
There is no other cause so urgent
as to bring us so far from our homes.

579
00:43:58,871 --> 00:44:00,930
This is our purpose.

580
00:44:01,106 --> 00:44:03,199
This is Operation Overlord.

581
00:44:03,942 --> 00:44:09,005
Explaining how we will succeed
is best done by my chiefs of staff...

582
00:44:09,181 --> 00:44:11,411
...starting with General Montgomery...

583
00:44:11,583 --> 00:44:15,713
...commander, 21st Army Group
and responsible for all our land forces.

584
00:44:15,888 --> 00:44:17,947
General, if you will.

585
00:44:22,728 --> 00:44:25,458
Your Majesties.

586
00:44:25,631 --> 00:44:30,000
Of the enemy's 60 divisions in France,
10 are armored.

587
00:44:30,169 --> 00:44:32,399
Commanded by Erwin Rommel.

588
00:44:32,571 --> 00:44:36,302
As you know, I faced him
in the desert and bested him.

589
00:44:36,475 --> 00:44:38,966
But make no mistake,
Rommel is an energetic...

590
00:44:39,144 --> 00:44:43,080
Clever, putting Monty
front and center.

591
00:44:43,248 --> 00:44:46,217
So he can bring
his tanks southward.

592
00:44:46,385 --> 00:44:49,752
But we shall make
a strike forward here.

593
00:44:49,922 --> 00:44:53,824
I hope to make Falaise 32 miles
inland within 40 hours.

594
00:44:53,992 --> 00:44:57,519
Paratroopers will total
over 30,000 men.

595
00:44:57,696 --> 00:45:02,224
The largest drop in history.
Casualties will be high...

596
00:45:02,401 --> 00:45:05,632
...but the size of the force should
draw two enemy divisions...

597
00:45:05,804 --> 00:45:09,103
...from the beaches, just as our men
are ready to disembark.

598
00:45:09,274 --> 00:45:10,866
To take the left flank...

599
00:45:11,043 --> 00:45:15,036
...we need to land enough men
to swamp Hitler's Atlantic wall.

600
00:45:15,214 --> 00:45:17,944
Losses amongst the British
and Canadian troops...

601
00:45:18,117 --> 00:45:20,381
...will be heavy
during the assault wave...

602
00:45:20,552 --> 00:45:23,316
...but easing off as they move
past the pillboxes.

603
00:45:23,489 --> 00:45:26,754
While fighter command provides cover
for the beach assault...

604
00:45:26,925 --> 00:45:29,485
...and strafes the Atlantic wall...

605
00:45:29,661 --> 00:45:34,928
...General Spaatz will smash the rail
links leading south from La Manche...

606
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:40,504
...delaying any attempt by Rommel
to reinforce his southern defenses.

607
00:45:49,114 --> 00:45:52,015
Well, Your Majesties,
gentlemen, there it is.

608
00:45:53,118 --> 00:45:57,885
We're anxious to hear your thoughts,
additions, criticisms. The floor is open.

609
00:45:58,323 --> 00:46:01,156
I am impressed by the detail...

610
00:46:01,326 --> 00:46:05,285
...the comprehensiveness
of your planning.

611
00:46:05,564 --> 00:46:10,467
But the expected losses,
the sheer carnage...

612
00:46:13,305 --> 00:46:15,637
I also ache at that thought,
Your Majesty.

613
00:46:18,777 --> 00:46:22,269
I remember my first trip
to Europe as a young man.

614
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:26,816
I felt blessed to be here, to see it...

615
00:46:26,985 --> 00:46:30,853
...to touch the origins of my own
country that I love so dearly.

616
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:36,825
I hoped one day that all Americans
would have the same opportunity.

617
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:44,430
Now hundreds of thousands will,
along with Britons and Canadians...

618
00:46:44,603 --> 00:46:48,903
...and European Allies
fighting to return home.

619
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:57,005
This kind of visit
isn't what I had in mind...

620
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:02,214
...but if they do not offer
the sacrifice of blood now...

621
00:47:02,387 --> 00:47:06,346
...we will all pay dearly
with added gallons later.

622
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:09,827
So if some must die...

623
00:47:09,995 --> 00:47:12,589
...it is in a worthy cause.

624
00:47:38,223 --> 00:47:40,783
I am in this thing
with you till the very end...

625
00:47:40,959 --> 00:47:44,156
...and if it fails,
we both go down together.

626
00:47:52,304 --> 00:47:55,967
It's dicey to get out on a limb
with disturbances over Baffin Island.

627
00:47:56,141 --> 00:48:01,010
If they form a front and move across
the North Atlantic, this time of year...

628
00:48:01,179 --> 00:48:03,647
...I'd say six days
for a top-speed journey...

629
00:48:03,815 --> 00:48:06,909
...and with the proposed
landing a week away...

630
00:48:07,085 --> 00:48:09,144
You realize that this may be...

631
00:48:09,321 --> 00:48:11,846
...the most important
weather forecast in history.

632
00:48:14,593 --> 00:48:15,821
I do indeed, sir.

633
00:48:16,962 --> 00:48:18,759
I'd feel a lot more comfortable...

634
00:48:18,931 --> 00:48:21,695
...if I could have another
two days before committing.

635
00:48:21,867 --> 00:48:24,028
The admiral can correct me
if I'm wrong...

636
00:48:24,202 --> 00:48:26,966
...but if we don't move
the men toward the ships...

637
00:48:27,139 --> 00:48:31,007
- ...we're gonna miss the tide, sir.
- I'll be damned if I wait till July.

638
00:48:31,176 --> 00:48:33,644
The men will go stark raving mad.

639
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,566
June 5 is a go.
Issue the movement orders.

640
00:48:58,737 --> 00:49:01,570
Well done. We'll do it proud, Ike.

641
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:05,176
I'll be in Falaise in 72 hours,
Paris by the autumn.

642
00:49:05,744 --> 00:49:08,178
Paris in the fall. Bless you, Monty.

643
00:49:08,347 --> 00:49:12,181
No one can say you don't tackle things
with two fists. I admire confidence.

644
00:49:12,351 --> 00:49:14,615
Let's all get some of that.

645
00:49:14,786 --> 00:49:16,720
All of you...

646
00:49:19,324 --> 00:49:21,155
...Godspeed.

647
00:49:23,562 --> 00:49:25,530
Thank you.

648
00:49:29,201 --> 00:49:30,668
Good luck.

649
00:49:54,726 --> 00:49:57,251
You're sure this is how
you want it, general?

650
00:49:57,429 --> 00:49:59,727
Yes, prime minister.

651
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:03,466
You see no value to me
or President Roosevelt...

652
00:50:03,635 --> 00:50:05,899
...speaking directly
to the people of Europe?

653
00:50:06,338 --> 00:50:09,637
Not until the landings
are an assured success.

654
00:50:10,075 --> 00:50:13,135
This way, if it fails,
I will be the first one to address...

655
00:50:13,311 --> 00:50:15,006
...the question of the invasion.

656
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,774
You and the president
will be blameless.

657
00:50:17,949 --> 00:50:21,214
I'm expendable. You two are not.

658
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,287
Shoulder the whole burden alone
to the very end, is it?

659
00:50:25,791 --> 00:50:29,090
One conductor is what I asked for
and what you've given me.

660
00:50:31,063 --> 00:50:34,226
You've made the manly choice.
I admire it.

661
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:38,736
All the same, between we two...

662
00:50:38,904 --> 00:50:43,671
...surely God himself must tremble
at the task that lies before you.

663
00:50:44,242 --> 00:50:46,574
And it is God's work you do, Ike...

664
00:50:46,745 --> 00:50:49,407
...for you hold all our lives
in your hands.

665
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:55,717
If I do God's work, then he will be
at my side, and I cannot fail.

666
00:50:56,421 --> 00:51:01,484
Although, candidly, God hasn't been
much help with DeGaulle.

667
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:07,129
Not even God could move him.
And it's no use looking to me.

668
00:51:07,299 --> 00:51:09,233
DeGaulle hates me.

669
00:51:09,401 --> 00:51:12,268
He ignores that France is
collaborating with the enemy.

670
00:51:12,437 --> 00:51:16,464
Pretends Vichy doesn't exist
and Jews aren't being rounded up.

671
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:18,131
A horrid man...

672
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:23,942
...but he guards French
prerogatives jealously.

673
00:51:24,116 --> 00:51:29,144
Take another run at him, Ike.
I'll back any bargain you strike.

674
00:51:29,621 --> 00:51:31,714
Would you just assure me
of one thing?

675
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:34,450
The sands
on these Norman beaches...

676
00:51:34,793 --> 00:51:36,727
...dense enough for tanks?

677
00:51:36,895 --> 00:51:38,556
You can drink to it, sir.

678
00:51:43,135 --> 00:51:44,727
<i>Once more...</i>

679
00:51:44,903 --> 00:51:47,463
<i>...unto the breach, dear friends.</i>
<i>Once more...</i>

680
00:51:47,639 --> 00:51:50,665
<i>...or close the wall up</i>
<i>with our English dead.</i>

681
00:51:50,842 --> 00:51:53,868
<i>In peace, there's nothing</i>
<i>so becomes a man...</i>

682
00:51:54,045 --> 00:51:56,070
<i>...as modest stillness and humility.</i>

683
00:51:56,248 --> 00:52:00,082
<i>But when the blast of war blows</i>
<i>in our ears, then imitate the tiger.</i>

684
00:52:00,252 --> 00:52:02,083
Do you get the feeling Europeans...

685
00:52:02,254 --> 00:52:04,814
...have been at this war
thing for a long time?

686
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:08,892
Too long.
It's almost as if they like war.

687
00:52:09,828 --> 00:52:13,787
<i>I am afeard there are few die well</i>
<i>that die in a battle.</i>

688
00:52:13,965 --> 00:52:15,694
<i>How can they charitably</i>
<i>dispose...?</i>

689
00:52:15,867 --> 00:52:18,529
Sounds like Shakespeare
had it all figured out.

690
00:52:18,703 --> 00:52:20,933
Yeah.

691
00:52:21,106 --> 00:52:24,837
But he was writing after
the war was over and won.

692
00:52:33,685 --> 00:52:35,812
It's spooky...

693
00:52:35,987 --> 00:52:41,391
...listening to words written 400
years ago about our battlefields.

694
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:44,859
Words about blood and grief.

695
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:47,021
Very spooky.

696
00:52:47,199 --> 00:52:49,724
But if I may, ours is not
to reason why.

697
00:52:49,901 --> 00:52:52,699
Of course it is. We're the generals.

698
00:52:55,207 --> 00:53:00,270
I think Monty's got Churchill worried
that the beaches won't hold the tanks.

699
00:53:00,445 --> 00:53:03,903
I've told you a hundred times,
we've done our homework.

700
00:53:04,082 --> 00:53:06,880
The sand will support
the tank track rails with ease.

701
00:53:09,421 --> 00:53:12,254
I don't think that's what's
bothering you.

702
00:53:14,359 --> 00:53:18,227
- You read Marshall's letter.
- About the paratroopers? Yes, I did.

703
00:53:18,396 --> 00:53:20,159
- What'd you make of it?
- He's wrong.

704
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:22,894
He says drop the jumpers
behind the beaches.

705
00:53:23,068 --> 00:53:25,195
Try to draw the Germans
in two directions.

706
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:29,773
If I were Rommel, I'd ignore them.
Concentrate everything on the beach.

707
00:53:30,075 --> 00:53:33,704
I'd do the same. Every hour I delay
the invasion force from moving in...

708
00:53:33,878 --> 00:53:36,574
...would be another hour
airborne units would be isolated.

709
00:53:36,748 --> 00:53:39,979
Exactly. Besides, I need those men...

710
00:53:40,151 --> 00:53:43,848
...all 30,000 of them, to keep
nipping at the Krauts' heels.

711
00:53:44,022 --> 00:53:47,014
They have to be close to force
Rommel to deal with them.

712
00:53:47,192 --> 00:53:50,423
Yeah, but the drop zones, Brad.

713
00:53:50,862 --> 00:53:56,494
You heard Leigh-Mallory's estimate
of losses with a close drop. Carnage.

714
00:53:56,668 --> 00:53:58,932
How would a distant drop be better?

715
00:53:59,437 --> 00:54:02,065
If inland progress was slow,
we'd have those men...

716
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:05,539
...wandering around France
looking for something to eat.

717
00:54:08,747 --> 00:54:12,615
We'd be repeating the mistake
we made in Anzio.

718
00:54:16,721 --> 00:54:21,658
Marshall's a godfather to us, Brad.
I hate to cross the old man.

719
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,419
It's like a friend of mine said:

720
00:54:24,596 --> 00:54:28,123
"One supreme commander,
one voice."

721
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:34,597
<i>We few, we happy few,</i>
<i>we band of brothers.</i>

722
00:54:34,773 --> 00:54:37,970
<i>For he today that sheds his blood</i>
<i>with me shall be my brother...</i>

723
00:54:38,143 --> 00:54:39,735
<i>...be he ne'er so base.</i>

724
00:54:39,911 --> 00:54:42,243
<i>And gentlemen</i>
<i>in England, now abed...</i>

725
00:54:42,414 --> 00:54:45,383
<i>...shall think themselves accursed</i>
<i>they were not here...</i>

726
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:48,917
<i>...and hold their manhoods cheap</i>
<i>while any speaks...</i>

727
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:54,389
<i>...that fought with us upon</i>
<i>St. Crispin's Day!</i>

728
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,788
<i>My sovereign lord...</i>

729
00:54:57,962 --> 00:55:00,692
I hope the main attraction's
a bit more cheerful.

730
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:06,967
It's Rita Hayworth. A hell of a lot
easier on the eye than that bunch.

731
00:55:13,611 --> 00:55:15,943
<i>I've been in the theater years</i>
<i>and never seen...</i>

732
00:55:16,114 --> 00:55:18,344
<i>Excuse me, please.</i>

733
00:55:18,917 --> 00:55:20,942
<i>Why don't you be</i>
<i>a good boy and scram.</i>

734
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:23,451
- <i>Of course, we'll</i> go...
- <i>No, that's all right.</i>

735
00:55:23,621 --> 00:55:25,987
<i>You're welcome to stay here,</i>
<i>but this guy...</i>

736
00:55:26,157 --> 00:55:28,182
<i>This guy.</i>

737
00:55:29,828 --> 00:55:31,796
<i>I'm sorry. That's my one virtue.</i>

738
00:55:33,264 --> 00:55:34,663
- <i>McGuire.</i>
- <i>Hello.</i>

739
00:55:34,833 --> 00:55:36,767
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

740
00:55:36,935 --> 00:55:39,802
<i>It's a little crowded here.</i>
<i>Would you mind moving over?</i>

741
00:55:39,971 --> 00:55:43,372
<i>Oh, that's quite all right.</i>
<i>Make yourself at home.</i>

742
00:55:53,051 --> 00:55:55,542
<i>Dearest Mamie...</i>

743
00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:00,157
<i>...at last, the days grow longer,</i>
<i>and we will soon be in it.</i>

744
00:56:00,325 --> 00:56:05,058
<i>I face that with neither dread</i>
<i>nor joy.</i>

745
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:09,894
<i>How I wish this cruel business of war</i>
<i>could be completed quickly.</i>

746
00:56:11,002 --> 00:56:13,903
<i>It leaves me heartsick to think</i>
<i>of sending so many men...</i>

747
00:56:14,072 --> 00:56:17,405
<i>...against Hitler's Atlantic wall.</i>

748
00:56:17,575 --> 00:56:21,909
<i>I admit to having developed</i>
<i>a veneer of callousness...</i>

749
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:26,414
<i>...but counting the human cost</i>
<i>is a terribly sad business...</i>

750
00:56:26,584 --> 00:56:29,781
<i>...and no veneer of callousness</i>
<i>allows me to escape the truth...</i>

751
00:56:29,954 --> 00:56:33,822
<i>...that back home, the news</i>
<i>brings anguish and suffering.</i>

752
00:56:34,793 --> 00:56:37,990
<i>So many youngsters</i>
<i>already gone forever.</i>

753
00:56:38,163 --> 00:56:42,099
<i>Mothers, fathers, brothers...</i>

754
00:56:42,267 --> 00:56:44,565
<i>...sisters back home</i>
<i>have a difficult time...</i>

755
00:56:44,736 --> 00:56:49,036
<i>...retaining any belief</i>
<i>in the eternal rightness of things.</i>

756
00:56:50,008 --> 00:56:53,273
<i>There is no true glory in war.</i>

757
00:57:16,367 --> 00:57:18,835
Yes, sir. At 0900.

758
00:57:27,078 --> 00:57:28,739
Yes.

759
00:57:31,015 --> 00:57:35,577
Intelligence signals confirm Rommel
moved the 116th Panzer Division...

760
00:57:35,753 --> 00:57:39,484
...basing at Verville. That is shouting
distance from the main drops.

761
00:57:39,657 --> 00:57:42,421
Is it a single redeployment
or part of larger movement?

762
00:57:42,594 --> 00:57:47,054
So far, just a one-shot affair, but he
bypassed Juno, Sword and Gold...

763
00:57:47,232 --> 00:57:49,723
...and sent them directly
to Utah and Omaha.

764
00:57:50,168 --> 00:57:52,261
That doesn't change my view.

765
00:57:52,437 --> 00:57:55,235
We have to have the airborne
as close as possible.

766
00:57:55,406 --> 00:57:57,931
I need jumpers breathing
down the Germans' necks...

767
00:57:58,109 --> 00:58:00,543
...pulling them around.

768
00:58:01,579 --> 00:58:04,047
The plan always called
for the diversion to be...

769
00:58:04,215 --> 00:58:06,649
I know!

770
00:58:09,153 --> 00:58:10,882
I know.

771
00:59:06,311 --> 00:59:11,010
- You're new here. What's your name?
- Corporal William Younger, ma'am.

772
00:59:11,416 --> 00:59:14,112
All right, now remember,
we hear nothing in this room.

773
00:59:14,285 --> 00:59:15,752
And we never speak.

774
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,649
No matter what,
we never stop work.

775
00:59:17,822 --> 00:59:21,349
The king himself may enter, but what
we're doing must take priority.

776
00:59:21,526 --> 00:59:23,653
Now carry on.

777
00:59:23,828 --> 00:59:27,161
- They deserve a force at the Krauts'...
- Stop.

778
00:59:27,332 --> 00:59:29,926
I know the risks for both sides...

779
00:59:30,101 --> 00:59:32,695
...but neither of you
makes a decisive case.

780
00:59:33,271 --> 00:59:35,102
How many ways can I say it?

781
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:38,475
I'm counting on those jumpers
to split German attention...

782
00:59:38,643 --> 00:59:40,668
...ease pressure on the assault wave.

783
00:59:40,845 --> 00:59:44,042
And they should have, but that
was before Rommel redeployed.

784
00:59:44,215 --> 00:59:46,376
One division isn't a redeployment.

785
00:59:46,551 --> 00:59:48,883
For men in my drop,
it's a potential disaster.

786
00:59:49,387 --> 00:59:52,083
Jumpers and glider-borne troops
are sitting ducks...

787
00:59:52,256 --> 00:59:55,714
...for the first 10 minutes
until they regroup.

788
00:59:56,728 --> 00:59:59,162
Damn. There goes another.

789
01:00:03,401 --> 01:00:05,665
It's the 81st Infantry.

790
01:00:05,837 --> 01:00:08,738
<i>Wehrmacht,</i> conscripts,
the crack units are to the north.

791
01:00:08,906 --> 01:00:12,740
Perhaps. But if Jerry's reinforcing
the whole damn region...

792
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:16,368
...we lose 70 percent of glider troops
before they're out of planes.

793
01:00:16,547 --> 01:00:17,878
And the jumpers?

794
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:23,386
Some of them will make it, but they'll
be short of the numbers you need...

795
01:00:23,655 --> 01:00:26,590
...if seaborne landings are depending
on airborne to distract Jerry.

796
01:00:26,758 --> 01:00:29,921
You're saying there's no middle
ground. We should cancel it.

797
01:00:30,461 --> 01:00:32,429
We don't want the slaughter
of two fine divisions.

798
01:00:32,597 --> 01:00:36,624
The 101st and the 82nd are elite, Ike.
We'll need them down the line.

799
01:00:36,801 --> 01:00:39,998
We'll need them on June 5th.
Otherwise the entire German army...

800
01:00:40,171 --> 01:00:43,538
...will let loose on my assault waves.
My loss will be 70 percent.

801
01:00:43,708 --> 01:00:45,175
All right.

802
01:00:45,343 --> 01:00:47,072
Thank you. I've heard both sides.

803
01:00:48,613 --> 01:00:50,581
I need a night to sleep on it.

804
01:00:50,748 --> 01:00:54,616
Sorry to disturb, sir. May I?

805
01:00:54,786 --> 01:00:56,879
If it's good news.

806
01:00:57,055 --> 01:00:59,956
Well, sir, I wish I could say it was...

807
01:01:00,124 --> 01:01:04,458
...but it's getting a little bit uncertain.

808
01:01:04,629 --> 01:01:06,756
You said it would take days
for systems...

809
01:01:06,931 --> 01:01:08,796
...to get from Baffin Island to here.

810
01:01:08,966 --> 01:01:11,025
And so it should, sir.

811
01:01:11,202 --> 01:01:13,329
Unless they dislodge
from the jet stream...

812
01:01:13,504 --> 01:01:15,802
...a meteorological possibility,
they're not...

813
01:01:15,973 --> 01:01:19,067
I can't work with possibilities,
group captain.

814
01:01:19,243 --> 01:01:21,837
At minimum, I need probabilities.

815
01:01:22,013 --> 01:01:25,642
Are there such things
as meteorological probabilities?

816
01:01:27,752 --> 01:01:30,653
There will be, sir, within hours.

817
01:01:30,822 --> 01:01:33,757
Not fast enough, group captain.
I need hourly reports.

818
01:01:34,459 --> 01:01:36,051
Yes, sir.

819
01:01:40,832 --> 01:01:42,959
He doesn't make weather.
He talks about it.

820
01:01:43,134 --> 01:01:45,398
Then get him to say nicer things.

821
01:01:45,837 --> 01:01:48,772
Look, give me some time
to work on this airborne thing.

822
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:51,841
I'll send for you
when I've figured it out.

823
01:01:55,513 --> 01:01:57,947
Yes. What is it?

824
01:02:00,284 --> 01:02:04,220
Our friends at HQ say the airborne
decision is at a head.

825
01:02:04,388 --> 01:02:08,449
If you're to be heard,
now would be the hour, sir.

826
01:02:08,626 --> 01:02:10,753
And what do you think, Wiatt?

827
01:02:12,463 --> 01:02:15,057
Inland, they're no help
to the landing force.

828
01:02:15,233 --> 01:02:18,168
Keep them close,
they could be shredded.

829
01:02:20,204 --> 01:02:24,766
Let's see how he works it out.
Thank you, Wiatt.

830
01:02:52,804 --> 01:02:54,999
If I may...

831
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:57,205
...it's the right decision.

832
01:02:58,242 --> 01:03:01,370
Divisional commanders can't
factor in weather and the seas...

833
01:03:01,546 --> 01:03:06,040
...supplies, naval support,
DeGaulle, the politics.

834
01:03:07,051 --> 01:03:08,814
Besides, it's not their job.

835
01:03:14,659 --> 01:03:16,786
I'll inform Leigh-Mallory and Brad.

836
01:03:16,961 --> 01:03:18,929
Don't publish that order until I do.

837
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,134
You better get some sleep.

838
01:03:25,803 --> 01:03:28,397
You have another dragon
to slay tomorrow.

839
01:03:36,013 --> 01:03:37,844
<i>I've considered it.</i>

840
01:03:38,015 --> 01:03:42,816
Either way, some units will
sustain devastating losses.

841
01:03:42,987 --> 01:03:47,287
But this invasion is largely
dependent on sea and air power.

842
01:03:47,458 --> 01:03:49,892
Our land troops are inferior...

843
01:03:50,061 --> 01:03:52,825
...if for no other reason
than they're not on land.

844
01:03:52,997 --> 01:03:57,434
So our most important job
is securing beachheads.

845
01:03:57,602 --> 01:04:01,060
Deference must be given to protecting
troops trying to come ashore...

846
01:04:01,239 --> 01:04:05,642
...to clear the way for the armor and
artillery that will push Rommel back.

847
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:10,310
That being the case, despite
the projected losses, Traff...

848
01:04:10,481 --> 01:04:15,077
...even 70 percent,
the airborne operation has to go.

849
01:04:22,193 --> 01:04:25,651
It's the toughest choice
I've ever had to make.

850
01:04:26,664 --> 01:04:28,825
Do everything to diminish the hazards.

851
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,696
Go over every detail a thousand times.

852
01:04:32,737 --> 01:04:37,674
But as painful as it is, those soldiers
will have to bear the rough portion.

853
01:04:38,509 --> 01:04:44,106
General Bradley's assault troops
must be given every edge we can find.

854
01:04:44,982 --> 01:04:47,348
A perfectly sound decision.

855
01:04:47,518 --> 01:04:50,646
We'll keep Jerry watching out
for his backside.

856
01:04:50,821 --> 01:04:53,722
You get yours to those jumpers
as soon as you can.

857
01:04:53,891 --> 01:04:56,121
Count on it.

858
01:04:59,497 --> 01:05:01,624
Thank you, gentlemen.

859
01:05:04,735 --> 01:05:06,566
Brad?

860
01:05:08,773 --> 01:05:10,866
When he wakes up,
I'm seeing Churchill.

861
01:05:11,042 --> 01:05:13,272
- He's gonna bring it up...
- Will you lay off?

862
01:05:13,444 --> 01:05:15,605
I've told you, the sand will hold.

863
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:18,840
We tested with light bombing.
Resistance gave measurements.

864
01:05:19,016 --> 01:05:23,715
I know. If the first of those storms hits
the beaches the same time we do...

865
01:05:23,888 --> 01:05:25,913
...you're looking at 2 inches of rain.

866
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:30,459
Maybe 20-foot swells, eating
at the beaches. Huge erosion.

867
01:05:31,996 --> 01:05:35,159
Would you still go
in that kind of weather?

868
01:05:35,333 --> 01:05:39,599
If we don't go now...
A lot can happen in three weeks.

869
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:43,467
They'd get onto us.
Rommel can move more men.

870
01:05:43,641 --> 01:05:48,544
So I ask you again, my good friend,
what if the conditions are marginal?

871
01:05:48,713 --> 01:05:52,581
The beaches will be firm.
I know they will.

872
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:56,584
You can trust me on this
and not worry yourself about it further.

873
01:05:58,322 --> 01:06:01,985
- Thank you, general.
- General.

874
01:06:26,317 --> 01:06:29,616
Salute! Attention!

875
01:06:40,231 --> 01:06:43,394
Thank you for taking the time
to join us, general.

876
01:06:48,939 --> 01:06:53,239
Not even your headman's Kansas
charm can melt the French iceberg.

877
01:06:53,411 --> 01:06:54,708
Don't bet on it.

878
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:19,433
Attention, all ranks!
General officer!

879
01:07:21,572 --> 01:07:23,472
As you were.

880
01:07:24,275 --> 01:07:28,211
Come, general.
Let me provide you with some details.

881
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,545
Prime minister.

882
01:07:36,687 --> 01:07:39,554
If the Frenchman can back up
his manner...

883
01:07:39,723 --> 01:07:43,989
...he should be able to control
the weather for us. And the tides.

884
01:07:44,161 --> 01:07:47,392
All we want is he tells
the French to welcome us.

885
01:07:47,565 --> 01:07:49,965
Neutrality might mean
they'll work against us...

886
01:07:50,134 --> 01:07:51,658
...like some did at Dunkirk.

887
01:07:53,637 --> 01:07:54,968
My, my.

888
01:07:55,139 --> 01:07:58,836
Seems that our work isn't up
to the general's level.

889
01:08:14,158 --> 01:08:17,958
General DeGaulle,
I trust your confidence is buoyed.

890
01:08:20,131 --> 01:08:23,999
I think your Operation Overlord
is poorly conceived.

891
01:08:24,168 --> 01:08:27,626
I have explained its failures
to General Eisenhower.

892
01:08:28,205 --> 01:08:31,368
He has all the information to make
the necessary corrections.

893
01:08:31,542 --> 01:08:34,306
I'm grateful for the general's
contributions.

894
01:08:34,478 --> 01:08:36,378
I'll explain them to you all later.

895
01:08:36,547 --> 01:08:39,607
Although, as I've told the general,
with regret...

896
01:08:39,783 --> 01:08:43,947
...we simply don't have the time
to make the changes suggested.

897
01:08:47,491 --> 01:08:49,322
Perhaps...

898
01:08:49,527 --> 01:08:51,358
...you could use a moment alone...

899
01:08:52,463 --> 01:08:54,863
...to discuss other matters?

900
01:08:57,101 --> 01:08:58,762
Yes, sir.

901
01:08:58,936 --> 01:09:00,267
General?

902
01:09:11,682 --> 01:09:14,583
What do you expect from me,
general?

903
01:09:14,752 --> 01:09:17,812
- This is, after all, your speech.
- Yes.

904
01:09:17,988 --> 01:09:22,084
But it is to be broadcast to the French
people on the eve of their liberation.

905
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:25,057
I was hoping for your support
since we recognize you...

906
01:09:25,229 --> 01:09:26,696
...as their legitimate voice.

907
01:09:26,864 --> 01:09:29,264
Of course you do.
There is no one else.

908
01:09:29,433 --> 01:09:33,062
So I shall give my own address
when the time comes.

909
01:09:33,237 --> 01:09:36,866
As, of course, you must.
But it is our hope, our urgent hope...

910
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:38,804
...that you'll endorse
my remarks...

911
01:09:38,976 --> 01:09:41,501
...and that is why my speech
should concern you.

912
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:45,706
Your remarks concern me greatly,
General Eisenhower.

913
01:09:45,883 --> 01:09:48,681
But not for the reasons
you might like.

914
01:09:48,852 --> 01:09:51,343
Okay, what's wrong with it?

915
01:09:53,757 --> 01:09:58,251
Firstly, you urge Frenchmen
to follow your orders?

916
01:09:58,429 --> 01:10:00,624
Only I will command
the people of France.

917
01:10:01,532 --> 01:10:04,194
I understand that.
We all do.

918
01:10:04,368 --> 01:10:07,428
But this operation can only work
if it speaks with one voice.

919
01:10:07,605 --> 01:10:08,936
So they say.

920
01:10:09,106 --> 01:10:11,836
You even ask my people
to accept Allied money.

921
01:10:12,009 --> 01:10:18,073
Yet, as president of the provisional
government, only I can issue currency.

922
01:10:18,249 --> 01:10:21,810
You say local administrations
will stay in place.

923
01:10:21,986 --> 01:10:23,476
For stability, general.

924
01:10:23,654 --> 01:10:26,248
Only I shall decide
what to do with Vichy officials.

925
01:10:26,423 --> 01:10:28,948
No, no. It's quite impossible.
I'll never accept...

926
01:10:29,126 --> 01:10:31,754
...that you can speak
for all the Allies.

927
01:10:31,929 --> 01:10:33,487
The British have.

928
01:10:33,664 --> 01:10:39,261
The Canadians, the Australians,
the exiled Dutch and Poles.

929
01:10:39,436 --> 01:10:41,427
Roosevelt and Churchill have agreed.

930
01:10:41,872 --> 01:10:44,204
Come to think of it,
you're the only exception.

931
01:10:44,475 --> 01:10:49,378
You will not treat us like Italy.
We are not German allies.

932
01:10:49,546 --> 01:10:53,880
In fact, the Vichy government
is precisely that, general.

933
01:10:55,085 --> 01:11:00,455
But we will liberate France and
treat her as an ally nonetheless.

934
01:11:00,624 --> 01:11:04,822
All I ask is that you speak on the radio
after my address...

935
01:11:04,995 --> 01:11:07,862
...and call on your people
to aid us in their liberation.

936
01:11:08,032 --> 01:11:10,262
Speak after you?
Impossible.

937
01:11:10,434 --> 01:11:13,801
That would imply I approve
of your program.

938
01:11:18,375 --> 01:11:19,842
I understand.

939
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:23,476
Allow me to see you to your car.

940
01:11:47,838 --> 01:11:50,238
- You're wet, Stagg.
- Aye, sir.

941
01:11:50,407 --> 01:11:52,875
It started raining.

942
01:11:57,348 --> 01:12:00,977
- I find that very depressing.
- Depressing. Yes.

943
01:12:01,151 --> 01:12:04,712
Well, three depressions, actually.
One after the other.

944
01:12:04,888 --> 01:12:08,016
They rolled in from Baffin Island
in unbelievably quick time.

945
01:12:08,192 --> 01:12:11,753
- I've never seen it like...
- How long before they pass through?

946
01:12:11,929 --> 01:12:13,726
- All three?
- Yes.

947
01:12:13,897 --> 01:12:18,129
Three to five days.
Might be some calm in between them.

948
01:12:18,302 --> 01:12:21,567
Meantime, we're looking at swells
of up to 40 feet mid-Channel...

949
01:12:21,739 --> 01:12:23,866
...30-feet breakers
on the landing zones...

950
01:12:24,041 --> 01:12:26,373
...and winds of up to 50 miles
an hour.

951
01:12:26,543 --> 01:12:29,034
We can't get the gliders
and C-47's off the ground.

952
01:12:29,213 --> 01:12:32,478
Even if we did, they'd be blown all
over Europe when they jumped.

953
01:12:32,649 --> 01:12:34,514
Embarkation status, Birdie?

954
01:12:34,685 --> 01:12:37,381
Crew's aboard ship,
vessel's fully loaded.

955
01:12:37,554 --> 01:12:41,547
Mulberries and LST is fueled.
More crafts still at mooring.

956
01:12:41,725 --> 01:12:43,659
C-47's in place.
Gliders leashed.

957
01:12:43,827 --> 01:12:46,660
Men ready for boarding
on 30 minutes' notice.

958
01:12:46,830 --> 01:12:49,526
We can't send them.
They'll drown before they arrive.

959
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:52,430
True enough.
Some will.

960
01:12:52,603 --> 01:12:55,436
But we have to calculate the margins.

961
01:12:55,606 --> 01:12:57,597
This might work to our advantage.

962
01:12:57,775 --> 01:13:01,438
It's certain Jerry won't expect
an invasion force in this weather.

963
01:13:01,612 --> 01:13:05,343
Of course, it is up to you.
But with all the goodwill in the world...

964
01:13:05,516 --> 01:13:09,384
- ...we can't wait forever.
- No.

965
01:13:10,254 --> 01:13:14,953
But we can wait one more day.
We owe the men that.

966
01:13:15,125 --> 01:13:19,585
Disembarkation is delayed
24 hours to Tuesday.

967
01:13:19,763 --> 01:13:24,598
We meet at 0130 hours
tomorrow morning to finalize.

968
01:14:17,354 --> 01:14:20,881
Sir, there's a definite break
almost immediately at hand.

969
01:14:21,058 --> 01:14:22,286
What kind of break?

970
01:14:24,394 --> 01:14:26,919
This dreadful torrent that seems...

971
01:14:27,531 --> 01:14:30,398
...ready to wash us away
will lift in three hours or so.

972
01:14:30,567 --> 01:14:32,728
For how long?
What's off the Irish coast?

973
01:14:32,903 --> 01:14:34,871
A nasty low.
But even at top speed...

974
01:14:35,038 --> 01:14:38,337
...it would need 36 hours
to reach the Normandy coast.

975
01:14:38,509 --> 01:14:40,534
Meanwhile, winds will moderate.

976
01:14:40,711 --> 01:14:43,703
The bombers should be able
to operate starting tomorrow...

977
01:14:43,881 --> 01:14:45,371
...and right into June 6th.

978
01:14:45,549 --> 01:14:48,109
At best, a moderately
good night for drop zones.

979
01:14:48,285 --> 01:14:49,718
For air power, generally.

980
01:14:49,887 --> 01:14:54,085
Heavy and medium bombers will find
the going, well, chancy at best.

981
01:14:54,258 --> 01:14:57,591
True, but we could press our entire
force of bombers into service.

982
01:14:57,761 --> 01:14:59,820
They'd operate well
in these conditions.

983
01:14:59,997 --> 01:15:01,794
Yes. I expect they would.

984
01:15:01,965 --> 01:15:04,957
But if Stagg could give us
a larger window on the 7th...

985
01:15:05,135 --> 01:15:06,602
I'd take comfort in that.

986
01:15:06,770 --> 01:15:09,238
I'm not ready to give up
on the 6th, Stagg.

987
01:15:09,406 --> 01:15:10,634
Sir.

988
01:15:12,175 --> 01:15:15,201
Would you know more
by 0200 hours, son?

989
01:15:16,179 --> 01:15:18,670
I expect we'd have a better sense
of the speed...

990
01:15:18,849 --> 01:15:20,714
...of the next storm's approach. Yes.

991
01:15:20,884 --> 01:15:23,614
I'm afraid that's not good enough,
old man.

992
01:15:23,787 --> 01:15:26,278
The American force
has the longest sea journey.

993
01:15:26,456 --> 01:15:29,289
Now, they must put to sea
in the next half-hour...

994
01:15:29,459 --> 01:15:31,689
...if Overlord's to happen
on the 6th.

995
01:15:31,862 --> 01:15:36,094
And further, if you have Admiral
Kirk set sail then recall his fleet...

996
01:15:36,266 --> 01:15:38,359
...for worsening weather,
he can't refuel.

997
01:15:38,535 --> 01:15:42,767
- Won't be ready in time for the 7th.
- Too late after that.

998
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:46,103
Tides and moon won't be
in the right alignment on the 8th.

999
01:15:47,077 --> 01:15:49,341
Any reason we shouldn't go
on the 6th, Monty?

1000
01:15:49,813 --> 01:15:51,678
I would say go.

1001
01:15:52,015 --> 01:15:54,609
One hell of a gamble to go now.

1002
01:15:54,785 --> 01:15:57,219
- Very chancy.
- I know.

1003
01:15:57,387 --> 01:16:00,151
The question is, how long
can we hang this operation...

1004
01:16:00,324 --> 01:16:03,452
...on the end of a limb
and just let it dangle there?

1005
01:16:08,999 --> 01:16:11,490
I'm quite positive the order
must be given.

1006
01:16:13,470 --> 01:16:16,030
Signal will go to the fleet
immediately, sir.

1007
01:16:16,206 --> 01:16:20,233
We meet again at 0400 hours
for a report on their progress.

1008
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:24,312
That'll be our last chance
to hold off till July.

1009
01:17:46,730 --> 01:17:51,133
Finally going as I predicted, sir.
The break is almost upon us.

1010
01:17:51,401 --> 01:17:53,733
Long-range forecast
still unpleasant...

1011
01:17:53,904 --> 01:17:58,034
...but I can promise the weather
will clear in a matter of hours.

1012
01:18:00,210 --> 01:18:02,201
Gentlemen.

1013
01:18:02,379 --> 01:18:04,506
I command you...

1014
01:18:05,048 --> 01:18:08,916
...but you command the men
I'm about to throw into battle.

1015
01:18:09,252 --> 01:18:12,016
One last go-round, please.

1016
01:18:13,523 --> 01:18:16,390
Well, they're almost in the Channel.

1017
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:19,461
The weather front is moving
faster than the ships.

1018
01:18:19,629 --> 01:18:23,690
By the time the LSTs reach landfall,
sea shall be calm.

1019
01:18:23,867 --> 01:18:26,700
I say, no turning back.

1020
01:18:27,037 --> 01:18:31,064
- Agreed.
- A dark day for airborne, I'm afraid.

1021
01:18:31,241 --> 01:18:34,677
Well, if there is to be a recall,
it must be now.

1022
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:44,782
Let's go.

1023
01:18:51,495 --> 01:18:53,793
Sixth Airborne K-12!

1024
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:12,614
Stand by, signal...

1025
01:19:13,450 --> 01:19:15,350
8977 in the wing.

1026
01:19:25,729 --> 01:19:28,095
Last one at the dance?

1027
01:19:28,265 --> 01:19:30,130
Or the first?

1028
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:33,269
Hell, that's just the way it is, Beetle.

1029
01:19:34,404 --> 01:19:36,895
One minute I'm exactly
what Churchill described...

1030
01:19:37,073 --> 01:19:39,473
...the most powerful man in history.

1031
01:19:39,643 --> 01:19:44,842
Now the order's given.
Hell, I'm just audience.

1032
01:19:45,015 --> 01:19:47,677
Front row, center, to be sure.

1033
01:19:49,686 --> 01:19:52,917
But a corporal on Juno,
a private on Utah...

1034
01:19:54,291 --> 01:19:57,089
...they're the ones who will affect
the outcome, not me.

1035
01:19:57,594 --> 01:19:59,789
It's up to them now.

1036
01:20:00,230 --> 01:20:02,095
Yes, sir.

1037
01:20:15,912 --> 01:20:18,574
All right. Gather around.

1038
01:20:18,748 --> 01:20:22,514
Ten minutes to onload.
Just enough time for a visitor.

1039
01:20:22,686 --> 01:20:26,383
The supreme commander himself
is coming to see us off.

1040
01:20:26,556 --> 01:20:29,320
No kidding.
Hell, I'll bet he ain't coming with, boys.

1041
01:20:29,492 --> 01:20:30,720
It's not his job.

1042
01:20:30,894 --> 01:20:33,328
Besides, he hasn't earned
his Jump Wings.

1043
01:20:33,496 --> 01:20:37,728
All right. Here's the protocol.
Do not speak unless spoken to.

1044
01:20:37,901 --> 01:20:39,334
If he asks you a question...

1045
01:20:39,502 --> 01:20:42,699
...you'll find that generals
are not interested in the personal.

1046
01:20:42,873 --> 01:20:44,864
Be prepared to answer
questions such as:

1047
01:20:45,041 --> 01:20:47,566
Where you trained,
where you did jump school.

1048
01:20:47,878 --> 01:20:51,473
What kind of medals and ribbons
you've earned. Stuff like that.

1049
01:20:51,648 --> 01:20:53,047
All right?

1050
01:21:24,915 --> 01:21:29,284
Seven out of 10, Beetle.
Maybe more.

1051
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:33,853
In God's hands, sir.

1052
01:21:58,348 --> 01:22:01,340
At ease.
Gather around.

1053
01:22:01,785 --> 01:22:03,446
That's an order, jumpers.

1054
01:22:04,521 --> 01:22:06,921
Smoke them if you got them.

1055
01:22:07,257 --> 01:22:10,818
- Where you from, son?
- Basic at Dix, jumped at Bragg, sir.

1056
01:22:10,994 --> 01:22:12,894
Corporal, I asked where you're from.

1057
01:22:13,063 --> 01:22:15,554
You had a life before the Army,
didn't you?

1058
01:22:16,232 --> 01:22:19,065
You bet I did, sir.
I'm a Chicago boy.

1059
01:22:19,235 --> 01:22:21,897
- Southside.
- Good for you.

1060
01:22:22,072 --> 01:22:25,508
- How about you? Where you from?
- New Orleans, sir.

1061
01:22:26,343 --> 01:22:28,743
Nebraska, sir.
Go Corn Huskers.

1062
01:22:28,912 --> 01:22:31,403
That's the wrong team, jumper.

1063
01:22:31,581 --> 01:22:34,414
- Anybody here from Kansas?
- I'm from Kansas, sir.

1064
01:22:34,584 --> 01:22:37,144
- Go get them, Jayhawks.
- You bet. Look out, Hitler.

1065
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:40,847
- Here we come.
- Yeah!

1066
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:43,356
- All ready, then?
- Yes, sir.

1067
01:22:43,526 --> 01:22:45,084
No, we ain't worried, general.

1068
01:22:45,261 --> 01:22:48,025
It's the Krauts that
ought to be worrying now.

1069
01:22:49,566 --> 01:22:52,228
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have a light?

1070
01:22:54,037 --> 01:22:57,234
- Yes, I do, lieutenant.
- Thank you, sir.

1071
01:23:14,357 --> 01:23:16,689
<i>Our landings on the French coast</i>
<i>have failed...</i>

1072
01:23:16,860 --> 01:23:22,389
<i>...to gain a satisfactory foothold,</i>
<i>and I have withdrawn the troops.</i>

1073
01:23:23,066 --> 01:23:26,160
<i>My decision to attack at this time</i>
<i>and place was based upon...</i>

1074
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:28,964
<i>...the best information available.</i>

1075
01:23:29,139 --> 01:23:34,475
<i>If any blame or fault attaches</i>
<i>to the attempt, it is mine alone.</i>

1076
01:23:40,216 --> 01:23:45,017
If it all goes wrong,
if Overlord fails...

1077
01:23:46,523 --> 01:23:48,923
...give that to the press.

1078
01:23:54,597 --> 01:23:57,464
<i>Of course, Overlord did not fail.</i>

1079
01:23:58,368 --> 01:24:00,529
<i>How could it?</i>

1080
01:24:00,970 --> 01:24:04,497
<i>With so many fine young men and</i>
<i>women from all corners of the earth...</i>

1081
01:24:06,076 --> 01:24:09,910
<i>...all determined to do their best</i>
<i>to free a world gone half-mad.</i>

1082
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:12,207
<i>There would be setbacks.</i>

1083
01:24:12,382 --> 01:24:17,285
<i>There would be small triumphs,</i>
<i>even in the first few hours.</i>

1084
01:24:19,389 --> 01:24:21,949
A message from Leigh-Mallory.

1085
01:24:22,659 --> 01:24:24,422
Read it.

1086
01:24:26,062 --> 01:24:27,359
"Urgent.

1087
01:24:27,530 --> 01:24:31,864
Sir, it is at times difficult
to admit one is wrong.

1088
01:24:32,035 --> 01:24:36,096
But I have the great pleasure
in doing so on this occasion.

1089
01:24:36,272 --> 01:24:39,605
Casualties are dramatically below
my estimates.

1090
01:24:39,776 --> 01:24:42,768
I congratulate you
on your command decision...

1091
01:24:42,946 --> 01:24:47,246
...and apologize for adding
to the supreme commander's worries.

1092
01:24:47,417 --> 01:24:49,476
Leigh-Mallory."

1093
01:24:51,988 --> 01:24:55,389
- Any numbers?
- Early estimates...

1094
01:24:55,558 --> 01:24:58,049
...about 20 percent.

1095
01:25:02,899 --> 01:25:06,665
- Carry on, general.
- Sir.

1096
01:25:14,644 --> 01:25:17,169
<i>Twenty percent</i>
<i>is so much better than 70.</i>

1097
01:25:18,481 --> 01:25:21,416
<i>But the loss of even one</i>
<i>of this gallant band is a loss...</i>

1098
01:25:21,584 --> 01:25:24,985
<i>...to all decent humanity everywhere.</i>

1099
01:25:25,155 --> 01:25:31,094
<i>And besides, if the person killed</i>
<i>in action is you or the one you love...</i>

1100
01:25:31,461 --> 01:25:34,919
<i>...then the odds</i>
<i>are 100 percent in that case.</i>

1101
01:25:35,098 --> 01:25:39,364
<i>They knew that,</i>
<i>these great crusaders.</i>

1102
01:25:39,536 --> 01:25:42,027
<i>But they went anyway.</i>

1103
01:25:45,508 --> 01:25:48,705
<i>Too many of them are now with God.</i>

1104
01:25:49,779 --> 01:25:52,748
<i>We may never see their like again.</i>

1105
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:57,913
<i>We may never see their like again.</i>

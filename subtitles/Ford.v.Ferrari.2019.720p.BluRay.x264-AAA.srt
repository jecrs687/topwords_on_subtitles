<i>This is live coverage</i>

3
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,816
<i>of the 1959
24 Hours of Le Mans.</i>

4
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,416
<i>We've reached
the halfway point</i>

5
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:02,020
<i>and so far witnessed
Aston Martin number 5,</i>

6
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,554
<i>driven by Carroll Shelby,</i>

7
00:01:03,654 --> 00:01:06,091
<i>making great gains
in the last hour.</i>

8
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,491
<i>If he keeps this pace up,</i>

9
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:09,027
<i>he could have
a chance at the...</i>

10
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:27,779
He's coming in.

11
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,915
He's coming in.
Let's go, let's go.

12
00:01:30,015 --> 00:01:32,017
- Tires!
- Let's go, let's go.

13
00:01:32,117 --> 00:01:33,360
I know you're tired,
but come on,

14
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:34,384
let's make this fast.

15
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:35,821
Move, move, move!

16
00:01:37,856 --> 00:01:39,366
She's running a little hot,
but we're good.

17
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,792
Tires are still gripping.

18
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,326
Fire! The fuel! Fire!

19
00:01:42,426 --> 00:01:44,266
- Shelby, it's you!
- Grab that blanket!

20
00:01:45,696 --> 00:01:47,631
Get off me! Off!

21
00:01:49,968 --> 00:01:51,335
You okay?

22
00:01:53,805 --> 00:01:55,006
Fill the tank!

23
00:01:56,607 --> 00:01:58,810
- Shelby, you just...
- Am I on fire?

24
00:02:00,946 --> 00:02:01,947
Am I on goddamn fire?

25
00:02:02,047 --> 00:02:03,690
- No, you're not on fire.
- Fill the damn tank!

26
00:02:03,714 --> 00:02:05,092
- Fill the tank.
- Fill the tank.

27
00:02:05,116 --> 00:02:06,236
Get it ready!

28
00:02:06,985 --> 00:02:09,420
- Where am I, Eddie?
- Two laps up, my friend.

29
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,564
Car's yours.

30
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,123
Go get 'em.

31
00:02:33,912 --> 00:02:35,512
<i>Aston Martin number 5,</i>

32
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,916
<i>driven by Carroll Shelby,
has maintained his lead</i>

33
00:02:38,016 --> 00:02:40,417
<i>as we're nearing
the final minutes of the race.</i>

34
00:02:40,517 --> 00:02:41,585
<i>Shelby.</i>

35
00:02:41,685 --> 00:02:43,205
<i>The checkered flag is out.</i>

36
00:02:44,356 --> 00:02:46,024
<i>The crowd are on their feet.</i>

37
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:46,990
<i>Shelby.</i>

38
00:02:46,992 --> 00:02:48,232
<i>...takes the title!</i>

39
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,327
<i>An American wins Le Mans.</i>

40
00:02:49,426 --> 00:02:50,628
<i>Shelby.</i>

41
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,265
Carroll Shelby.

42
00:02:53,365 --> 00:02:54,598
What?

43
00:02:54,698 --> 00:02:56,768
This is something
you can't ignore anymore.

44
00:02:56,868 --> 00:02:58,970
Oh, I take the pills.
The pills work.

45
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:02,908
An elevated
heart rate, say 130 BPM,

46
00:03:03,008 --> 00:03:05,310
sustained even
for a short period,

47
00:03:05,442 --> 00:03:07,112
you run a critical risk
of cardiac arrest.

48
00:03:07,212 --> 00:03:09,580
- I'll race shorter format then.
- That's not gonna work.

49
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,384
Well, I could race NASCAR.
Formula One.

50
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,418
The valve is shot, Shelby.

51
00:03:14,886 --> 00:03:16,520
This is as serious as it gets.

52
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,790
In my opinion, you're lucky
to be sitting here today.

53
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,093
Well, I feel real lucky.

54
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,163
Luckiest guy on earth.

55
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:47,285
<i>There's a point
at 7,000 RPM</i>

56
00:03:47,385 --> 00:03:49,254
<i>where everything fades.</i>

57
00:03:57,963 --> 00:04:01,032
<i>The machine
becomes weightless.</i>

58
00:04:01,132 --> 00:04:02,233
<i>Just disappears.</i>

59
00:04:03,935 --> 00:04:04,970
Hey!

60
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:06,938
Watch it, buddy!

61
00:04:11,076 --> 00:04:14,145
<i>And all that's left
is a body</i>

62
00:04:14,245 --> 00:04:16,047
<i>moving through space and time.</i>

63
00:04:22,287 --> 00:04:23,955
<i>7,000 RPM.</i>

64
00:04:25,656 --> 00:04:27,025
<i>That's where you meet it.</i>

65
00:04:30,795 --> 00:04:32,629
<i>It asks you a question.</i>

66
00:04:33,597 --> 00:04:35,000
<i>The only question
that matters.</i>

67
00:04:38,602 --> 00:04:39,971
<i>"Who are you?"</i>

68
00:04:46,845 --> 00:04:48,880
Now, it's von Trips
in the Ferrari,

69
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,740
coming into the corkscrew.
He's braking late.

70
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,993
Hey, I called you
three times,

71
00:04:52,017 --> 00:04:53,318
and you never answer
the phone.

72
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,585
Oh! He sets a new lap record!

73
00:04:54,685 --> 00:04:55,997
I answer the phone
every time it rings.

74
00:04:56,021 --> 00:04:57,497
- No, sir, you do not.
- Yes, I do.

75
00:04:57,521 --> 00:04:58,521
No, you don't.

76
00:04:58,823 --> 00:05:00,759
A month ago, this car was fun.

77
00:05:01,658 --> 00:05:04,729
Now, it won't even start.
And when it does,

78
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:06,264
it's, "Boom, boom, boom!"

79
00:05:06,865 --> 00:05:08,632
When I pull out
of the driveway,

80
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:11,069
the dog has a heart attack.

81
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:13,369
All I'm asking is for
you to make it like it was.

82
00:05:13,405 --> 00:05:15,340
Yeah, you've coked up

83
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,875
the inlet valves
and the plugs.

84
00:05:16,975 --> 00:05:18,309
Nothing wrong with the car,

85
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,519
just the way
it's being driven.

86
00:05:19,543 --> 00:05:20,755
The way
it's being driven?

87
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:21,922
Too much fuel,
not enough spark.

88
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,124
That's what's
making her misfire.

89
00:05:23,148 --> 00:05:24,681
You wanna run that
by me in English?

90
00:05:26,985 --> 00:05:28,086
All right, sir.

91
00:05:29,354 --> 00:05:31,322
So...

92
00:05:31,423 --> 00:05:34,558
that there,
that is a sport car.

93
00:05:34,658 --> 00:05:36,693
You have to drive her
like a sport car.

94
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,595
If you drive her
like a school teacher,

95
00:05:38,695 --> 00:05:39,964
she'll clog up. All right?

96
00:05:40,065 --> 00:05:43,535
Try changing up
at 5,000 RPM, not two.

97
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:47,872
Drive like you mean it.
Hard and tight.

98
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:49,207
She'll run clean.

99
00:05:49,573 --> 00:05:51,076
Are you telling me
I don't know

100
00:05:51,176 --> 00:05:53,044
how to drive my own car?

101
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,313
No.

102
00:05:55,712 --> 00:05:57,124
But if you ask me,
this isn't your car.

103
00:05:57,148 --> 00:06:01,152
Your car's more a Plymouth
or a Studebaker.

104
00:06:02,887 --> 00:06:04,355
You and me have
a problem, buddy?

105
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:07,225
I don't have a problem.
I had an MG.

106
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,592
Mine ran just fine.

107
00:06:08,692 --> 00:06:10,361
Screw you, you limey prick.

108
00:06:10,627 --> 00:06:11,627
I want my money back.

109
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,932
Oh, behave. I'd give it to ya.

110
00:06:14,299 --> 00:06:16,259
But you haven't paid
for last month's service yet.

111
00:06:16,301 --> 00:06:18,570
This country,
the customer's always right.

112
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:19,880
You ever hear that?

113
00:06:19,904 --> 00:06:22,207
Yeah. Yeah.

114
00:06:22,307 --> 00:06:23,707
Utter nonsense.

115
00:06:24,042 --> 00:06:26,311
Now remember,
I advanced the timing,

116
00:06:26,411 --> 00:06:29,547
so a smidge twitchy in first.

117
00:06:29,646 --> 00:06:32,517
Get the revs up.
Good lad. Revs up.

118
00:06:34,452 --> 00:06:35,787
Ta-ra.

119
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,091
Another satisfied customer?

120
00:06:42,961 --> 00:06:44,729
Can I help you, miss?

121
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,665
Wasn't that an MGA 1500?

122
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,669
Ah, you know your cars.

123
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,305
Well, I like them.

124
00:06:54,739 --> 00:06:56,407
I love the sound they make.

125
00:06:56,508 --> 00:06:58,209
The way it goes
right through you.

126
00:06:58,476 --> 00:06:59,611
Right.

127
00:07:00,677 --> 00:07:02,113
That vibration.

128
00:07:04,282 --> 00:07:07,819
Mine's the wood-paneled

129
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,054
Country Squire...

130
00:07:10,155 --> 00:07:11,789
across the street.

131
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,160
A real hot rod.

132
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,394
Oh, yeah?

133
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,263
- Is it fast?
- Very.

134
00:07:18,796 --> 00:07:20,999
Wait a second.
What type of girl are ya?

135
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,835
Type of girl who likes
the smell of wet gasoline.

136
00:07:23,935 --> 00:07:25,236
- Oh.
- Burnt rubber.

137
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:27,639
Oh, what, are you some kind
of a deviant,

138
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:28,973
are ya?

139
00:07:29,374 --> 00:07:31,075
Well, only since
I married you.

140
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,385
Hey, Gar,
what's going on?

141
00:07:40,485 --> 00:07:41,718
Something's up.

142
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:44,222
Hi, Lee.

143
00:07:44,322 --> 00:07:45,533
Listen,
he isn't as sure as you are

144
00:07:45,557 --> 00:07:46,791
about the banks.

145
00:07:48,326 --> 00:07:50,061
I'm not as sure
about this...

146
00:07:50,895 --> 00:07:52,830
How's this going out?

147
00:07:55,567 --> 00:07:58,336
- Don, what's going on?
- I don't know.

148
00:07:59,737 --> 00:08:00,948
Mr. Ford,
welcome to the room.

149
00:08:00,972 --> 00:08:02,049
Good afternoon,
Mr. Ford.

150
00:08:02,073 --> 00:08:03,408
Nice to see you, sir.

151
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,148
Shut it down, Mr. Beebe.

152
00:08:17,088 --> 00:08:18,122
John!

153
00:08:20,992 --> 00:08:24,262
All stop.

154
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,774
Hear that?

155
00:08:39,244 --> 00:08:43,448
That's the sound
of the Ford Motor Company...

156
00:08:44,182 --> 00:08:46,117
out of business.

157
00:08:51,389 --> 00:08:56,928
In 1899, my grandfather,
Henry, by God, Ford...

158
00:08:57,228 --> 00:09:00,565
was walking home
from Edison Illumination

159
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,800
after working a double shift.

160
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,469
He was ruminating.

161
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,872
That morning,
he had himself an idea

162
00:09:07,972 --> 00:09:10,108
that changed the world.

163
00:09:10,608 --> 00:09:12,243
Sixty-five years

164
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:15,780
and 47 million
automobiles later,

165
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,982
what shall be his legacy?

166
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:23,521
Getting it in the tail pipe
from a Chevy Impala.

167
00:09:28,226 --> 00:09:30,161
Here's what I want you to do.

168
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,896
Walk home.

169
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:39,170
While you're walking,
I want you to ruminate.

170
00:09:39,671 --> 00:09:42,775
Man comes to my office
with an idea,

171
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,476
that man keeps his job.

172
00:09:46,244 --> 00:09:49,213
Rest of you
second-best losers...

173
00:09:49,947 --> 00:09:51,349
stay home.

174
00:09:51,449 --> 00:09:53,351
You don't belong at Ford.

175
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:06,497
Shelby!

176
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,468
I see you.
Up and at 'em, buddy.

177
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,639
- Hey!
- Go away.

178
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,607
Come on. You can do it.

179
00:10:18,376 --> 00:10:19,477
Come on, baby.

180
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,846
8:30 a.m., time to roll.

181
00:10:21,946 --> 00:10:23,181
Let's go.

182
00:10:23,816 --> 00:10:25,717
- Let's go. Let's go, go, go.
- Go away.

183
00:10:25,818 --> 00:10:28,252
It's 8:30 a.m., baby.
Time to roll.

184
00:10:29,554 --> 00:10:30,955
Come on.

185
00:10:31,723 --> 00:10:32,758
Hey, Phil.

186
00:10:32,857 --> 00:10:34,092
Hey, Bob.

187
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,191
Is Shelby here?

188
00:10:35,193 --> 00:10:37,261
Uh, it's touch and go.

189
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,203
Shelby, you're up
bright and early.

190
00:10:45,303 --> 00:10:48,606
Well, early bird gets
the worm, Pops.

191
00:10:53,044 --> 00:10:54,288
All right,
who you worried about?

192
00:10:54,312 --> 00:10:57,415
Well, you got Red Faris
and Bill Rushton.

193
00:10:57,515 --> 00:10:58,883
They're all in 327s.

194
00:10:58,983 --> 00:11:00,451
Corvettes.
What about Bondurant?

195
00:11:00,551 --> 00:11:02,220
Bondurant? Well,
he's still driving...

196
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,622
- Mr. Shelby, can I get an autograph?
- ...for Washburn.

197
00:11:05,356 --> 00:11:06,825
Number 614.

198
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,336
- Thank you so much.
- All right, just relax. All right.

199
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,462
We're gonna eat those Vettes
for breakfast.

200
00:11:11,562 --> 00:11:12,897
We're lighter, we're faster,

201
00:11:12,997 --> 00:11:14,465
and that don't work,
we're nastier.

202
00:11:14,565 --> 00:11:17,135
<i>Hey, Dad,
before the race starts,</i>

203
00:11:17,235 --> 00:11:19,070
<i>take your son over
to the Willow Springs...</i>

204
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,373
Hey, Phil. Hey,
take it easy on us today, bud.

205
00:11:26,611 --> 00:11:27,612
You all right?

206
00:11:27,712 --> 00:11:28,847
Paragraph 15.4,

207
00:11:28,946 --> 00:11:30,681
section 2b
of the SCCA standard

208
00:11:30,783 --> 00:11:33,050
dictates all AF class cars
must have

209
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,754
minimum trunk space
of 20 inches by 12 inches

210
00:11:35,854 --> 00:11:37,188
by six inches.

211
00:11:37,555 --> 00:11:38,923
Your trunk doesn't close.

212
00:11:39,023 --> 00:11:41,192
- Ergo car fails standard.
- Wait, wait, wait. What?

213
00:11:41,292 --> 00:11:43,796
Ergo car is disqualified
from said Class A competition.

214
00:11:43,896 --> 00:11:45,096
No, no, no. Look, look, look.

215
00:11:45,196 --> 00:11:46,473
Can I ask you a question,
all right?

216
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,233
When you were a little boy,
did you think,

217
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,302
"When I grow up, I want to go

218
00:11:51,402 --> 00:11:53,538
"to the fabled
Willow Springs Raceway,

219
00:11:53,638 --> 00:11:56,407
"and I want to enforce
paragraph 15.4, section 2b

220
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:59,143
"of the SCCA regulations
on luggage capacity"?

221
00:11:59,243 --> 00:12:00,763
- All right, that's it.
- Did you?

222
00:12:00,813 --> 00:12:04,315
I'm ruling you and your team
disqualified from this race.

223
00:12:05,751 --> 00:12:07,591
Ah, well,
if it isn't Lance Reventlow.

224
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,755
- Ah, Shelby.
- How you doing, Lance?

225
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,935
- Pops.
- Hey, Lance.

226
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,356
Allow me to introduce
Dieter Voss.

227
00:12:12,457 --> 00:12:13,868
Runs Brumos Porsche
out of Jacksonville.

228
00:12:13,892 --> 00:12:15,426
Oh, I know all about Mr. Voss.

229
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,962
You're having a hell of a
season with that Abarth, sir.

230
00:12:18,062 --> 00:12:19,865
Seeing results
for your Cobra, too.

231
00:12:19,964 --> 00:12:21,900
- Thank you.
- Your guy Miles is impressive.

232
00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:23,501
- Oh, you following Miles?
- Oh, yes.

233
00:12:23,601 --> 00:12:26,404
Well, he was a USAC
road racing champ in '61.

234
00:12:26,504 --> 00:12:28,005
He won
the Pikes Peak Hill Climb.

235
00:12:28,105 --> 00:12:30,809
He was SCCA C-class champion
three years in a row

236
00:12:30,909 --> 00:12:33,010
in this piece-of-shit MG
he built himself.

237
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,880
We heard he's, uh, difficult.

238
00:12:34,979 --> 00:12:36,748
What, Ken? No, no.
Ken's a puppy dog.

239
00:12:36,849 --> 00:12:39,083
Hey, Lance, tell the man.
You've raced against Ken.

240
00:12:39,183 --> 00:12:41,787
Oh, I've driven more
behind him than against him.

241
00:12:42,253 --> 00:12:44,756
Well, Brumos is looking
for a driver

242
00:12:44,857 --> 00:12:46,591
for our number two car
at Sebring.

243
00:12:46,691 --> 00:12:48,435
- Is that right?
- How is that even possible?

244
00:12:48,459 --> 00:12:50,161
Think your guy Miles
can make the grade?

245
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:52,129
- Oh, well, Ken...
- Is he, mate? Hey!

246
00:12:52,363 --> 00:12:55,066
Jim! Is he putting
his bloody carryall

247
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:56,300
- in your trunk?
- What?

248
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,668
Discretionary infraction.

249
00:12:57,769 --> 00:12:59,337
Gentlemen, excuse me a moment.

250
00:13:00,004 --> 00:13:02,707
To be honest,
Ken was born for Sebring.

251
00:13:03,775 --> 00:13:06,210
Nothing in there
about my trunk

252
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,613
and your lovely
little portmanteau.

253
00:13:08,713 --> 00:13:12,283
You're holding
the '62 edition of the SCCA.

254
00:13:13,451 --> 00:13:16,621
And you can stick
this bloody sticker

255
00:13:16,721 --> 00:13:18,055
where the sun don't shine.

256
00:13:18,155 --> 00:13:20,033
Hey. Hey, Bill. What seems
to be the problem, Bill?

257
00:13:20,057 --> 00:13:22,527
The problem is that
Bill here is an arsehole.

258
00:13:22,627 --> 00:13:25,062
- No, he doesn't mean that.
- Oh, yes, he does. Yes, he does.

259
00:13:25,162 --> 00:13:28,533
No, he really does think
that Bill is an arsehole.

260
00:13:28,633 --> 00:13:30,577
- I'm just doing my job here.
- Hang on. Bill, Bill, Bill.

261
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,670
In my experience, there is...
Listen to me.

262
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,581
Something like this, there's
always a middle ground.

263
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:35,885
All right?
Now, Ken's outta line.

264
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:36,985
And I'm just doing my job.

265
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:38,151
I understand you are.

266
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,141
You know how he gets
on a race day.

267
00:13:39,143 --> 00:13:40,344
You know that. All right?

268
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:41,990
But you're not gonna DQ us
over a trunk.

269
00:13:48,719 --> 00:13:50,989
- What?
- You see that guy?

270
00:13:51,088 --> 00:13:52,390
Got his tail up.

271
00:13:59,664 --> 00:14:00,698
Happy, Bill?

272
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:04,736
Bill, I'll handle it.
I'll talk to him.

273
00:14:04,836 --> 00:14:07,371
I'll talk to him. You just go
and have a great day.

274
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,473
<i>Hey, folks, feeling hungry?</i>

275
00:14:09,574 --> 00:14:11,509
<i>Head on over
to the snack bar...</i>

276
00:14:11,777 --> 00:14:12,778
Shit.

277
00:14:13,277 --> 00:14:14,679
- Bulldog.
- Huh?

278
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,892
You know who that was
I was just talking to?

279
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:18,917
Bill.

280
00:14:19,017 --> 00:14:20,251
- Before that.
- No.

281
00:14:20,351 --> 00:14:22,186
It was Dieter Voss.

282
00:14:22,286 --> 00:14:23,588
Who's that?

283
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,324
He runs Porsche, Ken.

284
00:14:26,424 --> 00:14:28,602
It's a little German car company.
Maybe you heard of it.

285
00:14:28,626 --> 00:14:29,592
All right.

286
00:14:29,594 --> 00:14:31,095
He wanted you to drive
at Sebring.

287
00:14:31,195 --> 00:14:33,097
But he'd heard
you were difficult.

288
00:14:38,235 --> 00:14:43,474
I thought we felt the same way
about, uh, Germans.

289
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:49,513
Do you like losing, Ken?

290
00:14:51,482 --> 00:14:52,516
Excuse me?

291
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:53,851
Oh, you heard me.

292
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,020
I don't lose.

293
00:14:56,755 --> 00:15:00,291
Without sponsors,
you get no car, Ken.

294
00:15:00,391 --> 00:15:02,094
And last I checked,
the professionals

295
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,895
- all have a car.
- Shel!

296
00:15:03,996 --> 00:15:06,130
You cannot win the SCCA
without one.

297
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,132
If you're not winning,
you are losing.

298
00:15:08,232 --> 00:15:10,334
Don't make me lamp this
at your head.

299
00:15:10,434 --> 00:15:11,913
Did you bring your son
all the way out here

300
00:15:11,937 --> 00:15:13,057
to watch you
get disqualified

301
00:15:13,137 --> 00:15:14,672
or just act like a jackass?

302
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:20,244
Damn!

303
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,883
Well, that answers that.

304
00:15:42,868 --> 00:15:45,202
Peter...

305
00:15:54,012 --> 00:15:55,646
May I help you,
gentlemen?

306
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:57,581
Uh, yes,
is Ken Miles here?

307
00:15:58,182 --> 00:15:59,182
No.

308
00:15:59,216 --> 00:16:00,293
We need to speak to Mr. Miles.

309
00:16:00,317 --> 00:16:01,485
I'm his wife.

310
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,320
<i>Welcome to the 1963</i>

311
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,389
<i>Willow Springs 100.</i>

312
00:16:05,489 --> 00:16:08,693
<i>Twelve cars will be competing
in this 40-lap race.</i>

313
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,930
Hey, Ken,
what happened to your shield?

314
00:16:13,364 --> 00:16:15,666
New design.

315
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,845
<i>Well, it looks
like we're about to begin.</i>

316
00:16:17,869 --> 00:16:20,005
<i>The cars have completed
their warm-up lap.</i>

317
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:21,706
<i>The green flag is out...</i>

318
00:16:22,808 --> 00:16:25,342
<i>and they're approaching
the starting line.</i>

319
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:26,978
Here we go.

320
00:16:27,511 --> 00:16:31,215
Oh, bloody hell.

321
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:36,154
<i>Ken Miles has fallen behind.</i>

322
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,589
Learn to drive, you pillock!

323
00:16:44,395 --> 00:16:45,931
So, Shelby, do you miss it?

324
00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:49,835
Hey, Sam.

325
00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:54,072
Guy wins the 24-hour Le Mans,
suddenly retires,

326
00:16:54,538 --> 00:16:56,240
starts selling cars.

327
00:16:57,274 --> 00:16:58,442
It just don't make sense.

328
00:16:58,542 --> 00:17:00,812
Well, unless the rumors
are true, of course.

329
00:17:01,378 --> 00:17:03,414
Oh, what rumors
would those be, Sam?

330
00:17:04,515 --> 00:17:05,851
That Carroll Shelby
quit driving

331
00:17:05,951 --> 00:17:06,951
'cause he lost his nerve.

332
00:17:12,623 --> 00:17:15,761
I'm gonna out-brake you
on the next turn, Bob.

333
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:29,473
Ha-ha! Nice try, Bob.

334
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:48,535
<i>Nice move from Ken Miles.</i>

335
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:49,761
<i>Twenty-two laps remaining,</i>

336
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,763
<i>with Phil Hill
and Dan Gurney in the lead.</i>

337
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,278
<i>It's been an incredible day</i>

338
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,488
<i>here at Willow Springs,</i>

339
00:18:17,588 --> 00:18:19,758
<i>and we've seen
some exciting driving.</i>

340
00:18:19,858 --> 00:18:23,195
<i>With just one lap remaining
in this 40-lap race,</i>

341
00:18:23,295 --> 00:18:24,896
<i>we're coming
to the final stretch.</i>

342
00:18:24,996 --> 00:18:27,866
<i>Dan Gurney has been leading
the pack for most of the...</i>

343
00:18:27,966 --> 00:18:29,301
<i>Whoa!</i>

344
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:31,888
<i>Number 18, Red Faris,</i>

345
00:18:31,937 --> 00:18:32,938
<i>is off the track.</i>

346
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:34,806
<i>That leaves Dan Gurney
for the lead</i>

347
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:37,408
<i>followed by journeyman
Ken Miles.</i>

348
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,345
Now for you, Dan.

349
00:18:46,151 --> 00:18:48,286
<i>And they're
coming around the last turn.</i>

350
00:18:48,385 --> 00:18:49,754
<i>Gurney is still in the lead</i>

351
00:18:49,855 --> 00:18:51,522
<i>with Ken Miles
hot on his heels.</i>

352
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:00,832
<i>Miles is looking
for an opening.</i>

353
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:01,932
Not yet.

354
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:04,736
Come on.

355
00:19:04,836 --> 00:19:06,948
<i>Can Gurney hold
him off in the final straight?</i>

356
00:19:06,972 --> 00:19:07,973
Not yet.

357
00:19:10,574 --> 00:19:12,210
<i>Gurney is blocking him out.</i>

358
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,510
Now.

359
00:19:17,381 --> 00:19:18,926
<i>Miles goes for the shoulder.</i>

360
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:19,985
Nice move, Ken.

361
00:19:24,521 --> 00:19:25,800
<i>They're wheel to wheel.</i>

362
00:19:25,824 --> 00:19:26,925
Come on.

363
00:19:27,025 --> 00:19:28,860
<i>It's Corvette versus Cobra</i>

364
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,461
<i>for the finish.</i>

365
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:34,900
Yeah! Ha-ha!

366
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,667
Yeah!

367
00:19:36,768 --> 00:19:39,503
<i>An incredible
finish for Ken Miles.</i>

368
00:19:39,603 --> 00:19:42,874
<i>Didn't see that one coming.</i>

369
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,409
He's difficult but good.

370
00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:46,754
<i>Let's give
everyone a hand</i>

371
00:19:46,778 --> 00:19:48,013
<i>for one heck of a race.</i>

372
00:19:48,113 --> 00:19:50,782
That calls
for a nice cup of tea.

373
00:19:50,882 --> 00:19:52,683
I'll put the kettle on.

374
00:19:52,784 --> 00:19:53,784
Hop in.

375
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:00,025
<i>I'm</i>

376
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,027
<i>H-A-P-P-Y</i>

377
00:20:02,127 --> 00:20:03,962
<i>I'm H-A-P-P-Y</i>

378
00:20:04,062 --> 00:20:08,166
<i>I know I am, I'm sure I am
I'm H-A-P-P-Y</i>

379
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:12,003
Pops, frame this.

380
00:20:24,282 --> 00:20:25,516
Hey.

381
00:20:26,985 --> 00:20:28,452
We did it.

382
00:20:30,587 --> 00:20:32,023
What's wrong?

383
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:35,260
The IRS came.

384
00:20:35,927 --> 00:20:37,729
They've padlocked the garage.

385
00:20:43,068 --> 00:20:44,702
All right, Petey.

386
00:20:57,481 --> 00:20:58,984
A couple of years ago...

387
00:21:00,118 --> 00:21:01,786
you said we'd a nest egg.

388
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,554
Correct.

389
00:21:04,823 --> 00:21:06,257
A couple of years ago.

390
00:21:06,358 --> 00:21:07,726
Correct.

391
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,966
So just to be clear,
we are buggered.

392
00:21:15,367 --> 00:21:17,035
Absolutely.

393
00:21:23,475 --> 00:21:25,043
As in totally?

394
00:21:25,642 --> 00:21:30,714
As in, not a bean,
or a pot in which to piss.

395
00:21:30,815 --> 00:21:33,684
Spares, stock, all gone.

396
00:21:33,785 --> 00:21:36,221
Tools. My tools
are locked up in there.

397
00:21:37,721 --> 00:21:39,656
I'll figure something out.

398
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:42,659
In 1945...

399
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:44,896
our soldiers came home.

400
00:21:45,696 --> 00:21:47,531
What was the first thing
that they did?

401
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,668
They had sex.

402
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:53,872
Seventeen years later,

403
00:21:54,205 --> 00:21:55,774
those babies, they've grown.

404
00:21:55,874 --> 00:21:57,308
And they've got jobs.

405
00:21:57,742 --> 00:21:58,843
They've got licenses.

406
00:21:59,377 --> 00:22:03,248
But they do not wanna drive
the same dull 50s cars

407
00:22:03,348 --> 00:22:04,849
that their parents drove.

408
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,086
You see, kids today,
they want glamour.

409
00:22:08,186 --> 00:22:10,355
They want sex appeal.

410
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:11,655
They want to go fast.

411
00:22:12,357 --> 00:22:13,391
Gentlemen...

412
00:22:13,992 --> 00:22:16,261
it's time for
the Ford Motor Company

413
00:22:16,361 --> 00:22:17,594
to go racing.

414
00:22:18,997 --> 00:22:21,565
We're already
in racing, Iacocca.

415
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,234
NASCAR?

416
00:22:23,334 --> 00:22:25,437
It's... it's regional, sir.

417
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,973
If you go to the movies,
you open up a magazine,

418
00:22:29,074 --> 00:22:31,509
you don't see good ol' boys
from Winston-Salem.

419
00:22:31,608 --> 00:22:33,178
You see, uh...

420
00:22:34,045 --> 00:22:35,413
Sophia Loren...

421
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:38,049
Monica Vitti.

422
00:22:40,852 --> 00:22:44,189
James Bond does not drive
a Ford, sir.

423
00:22:44,556 --> 00:22:46,723
That's because
he's a degenerate.

424
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:51,429
See?

425
00:22:51,896 --> 00:22:53,398
God, I'd like to be
a degenerate.

426
00:22:54,132 --> 00:22:55,699
Um, just give me
one second here, sir.

427
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,511
Is this part of it?

428
00:22:57,535 --> 00:22:59,537
Is this going anywhere,
Iacocca?

429
00:22:59,636 --> 00:23:00,839
Just a second, sir.

430
00:23:00,939 --> 00:23:02,049
All right, all right,
that's enough.

431
00:23:02,073 --> 00:23:03,250
Sir, if you just bear
with me...

432
00:23:03,274 --> 00:23:04,354
Turn it off. Lights.

433
00:23:08,712 --> 00:23:11,682
Lee,
in the last three years,

434
00:23:11,783 --> 00:23:13,952
you and your marketing team...

435
00:23:14,385 --> 00:23:19,057
have presided over the worst
sales slump in US history.

436
00:23:20,892 --> 00:23:24,195
Why exactly should Mr. Ford
listen to you?

437
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:29,067
Because we've been
thinking wrong.

438
00:23:32,403 --> 00:23:33,505
Ferrari.

439
00:23:34,339 --> 00:23:37,208
Now, they have won four
out of the last five Le Mans.

440
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,545
We need to think like Ferrari.

441
00:23:41,112 --> 00:23:42,780
Ferrari makes
fewer cars

442
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:45,583
in a year
than we make in a day.

443
00:23:45,682 --> 00:23:48,520
We spend more
on toilet paper

444
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,089
than they do
on their entire output.

445
00:23:51,523 --> 00:23:53,791
You want us
to think like them?

446
00:23:53,892 --> 00:23:55,760
Enzo Ferrari will go down
in history

447
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,163
as the greatest
car manufacturer of all time.

448
00:23:59,531 --> 00:24:00,765
Why?

449
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:04,701
Is it because he built
the most cars?

450
00:24:06,437 --> 00:24:07,704
No.

451
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:10,408
It's because
of what his cars mean.

452
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:13,011
Victory.

453
00:24:13,545 --> 00:24:15,113
Ferrari wins at Le Mans.

454
00:24:15,213 --> 00:24:18,249
People, they, they want
some of that victory.

455
00:24:20,952 --> 00:24:24,088
What if the Ford badge
meant victory?

456
00:24:24,622 --> 00:24:25,890
And meant it
where it counts,

457
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:28,393
with the first group
of 17-year-olds in history

458
00:24:28,493 --> 00:24:29,727
with money in their pockets?

459
00:24:29,827 --> 00:24:31,529
This would take years.

460
00:24:31,829 --> 00:24:34,165
Decades to test and develop...

461
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:37,435
a race team capable
of taking out Ferrari.

462
00:24:37,535 --> 00:24:39,037
Ferrari's bankrupt.

463
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:44,842
Enzo has spent every lira
he's got chasing perfection,

464
00:24:44,943 --> 00:24:46,244
and you know something?

465
00:24:46,344 --> 00:24:47,779
He got there.

466
00:24:48,246 --> 00:24:49,713
But now he's broke.

467
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:15,440
You don't have
to give up racing

468
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,700
to get a bloody day job, Ken.

469
00:25:16,774 --> 00:25:17,775
I think I do.

470
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:19,010
Now, I've had my fun.

471
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:21,279
It's time to put food
on the table...

472
00:25:21,379 --> 00:25:22,345
and grow up.

473
00:25:22,347 --> 00:25:23,648
The garage didn't pay
the bills.

474
00:25:23,748 --> 00:25:24,849
Now it's locked up.

475
00:25:24,949 --> 00:25:26,551
Racing doesn't
pay them either,

476
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:27,685
and I keep winning.

477
00:25:27,785 --> 00:25:29,053
Yeah, because you're good.

478
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:31,623
But I can't play the game.

479
00:25:32,023 --> 00:25:34,225
I'm not what they call
a people person.

480
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:36,403
- You don't say.
- And I'm 45 years old.

481
00:25:36,427 --> 00:25:37,996
Do you really think
I'm gonna change?

482
00:25:38,096 --> 00:25:40,932
I'm never gonna get
the good rise.

483
00:25:41,032 --> 00:25:42,133
I started too late.

484
00:25:42,233 --> 00:25:44,068
Because you fought
in the bloody war.

485
00:25:44,902 --> 00:25:49,140
If you stop,
you'll be bloody insufferable.

486
00:25:50,308 --> 00:25:53,444
Let's quit going round
the Wrekin. It's over.

487
00:25:54,045 --> 00:25:55,713
Let's look on the bright side.

488
00:25:55,813 --> 00:25:57,015
Now I can get fat and old,

489
00:25:57,115 --> 00:25:59,851
trim the roses,
and eat pork pies.

490
00:26:20,605 --> 00:26:22,173
Uh, <i>scusa.</i>

491
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,075
Please, no photos.

492
00:26:24,175 --> 00:26:25,175
<i>Prego.</i>

493
00:26:25,243 --> 00:26:26,978
- Relax, will you?
- You gotta understand.

494
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:28,680
This is like the Mafia
showing up

495
00:26:28,781 --> 00:26:30,114
to buy the Statue of Liberty.

496
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:31,614
Kind of
the opposite, actually.

497
00:26:31,816 --> 00:26:35,119
The press gets wind of this,
the shit will hit the Fangio.

498
00:26:35,653 --> 00:26:37,522
Lee Iacocca, Ford Motor.

499
00:26:37,622 --> 00:26:39,357
Franco Gozzi, Ferrari.

500
00:26:41,859 --> 00:26:42,859
Journalists?

501
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,696
No, no, Mr. Iacocca, no.

502
00:26:44,797 --> 00:26:46,364
It's our cameras.

503
00:26:46,464 --> 00:26:47,865
Just for history.

504
00:26:50,736 --> 00:26:52,704
Four-liter Colombo engine.

505
00:26:54,372 --> 00:26:56,841
One man assembles
the entire engine

506
00:26:56,941 --> 00:26:58,276
by himself.

507
00:26:59,977 --> 00:27:03,081
Another man assembles
the transmission.

508
00:27:03,981 --> 00:27:05,550
Everything hand-built.

509
00:27:06,918 --> 00:27:08,152
<i>Bellissimo.</i>

510
00:27:21,632 --> 00:27:23,267
Racing Department.

511
00:27:24,669 --> 00:27:25,738
Lee.

512
00:27:25,838 --> 00:27:27,138
That's him.

513
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:34,379
This merger
between our companies

514
00:27:34,479 --> 00:27:35,848
will form two entities.

515
00:27:39,417 --> 00:27:40,651
Ford-Ferrari,

516
00:27:40,753 --> 00:27:42,220
90 percent owned by Ford,

517
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,789
who controls all production.

518
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,130
Secondly, Ferrari-Ford,
the race team,

519
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,198
90 percent owned by Ferrari.

520
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:03,541
In order to secure this,
Ford will pay the sum...

521
00:28:31,536 --> 00:28:32,970
Excuse me.

522
00:28:37,475 --> 00:28:39,745
He will need
some time to read this.

523
00:28:39,845 --> 00:28:41,412
Ah. Please.

524
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:46,117
Ah. Yeah, of course.

525
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:08,148
I'm looking for the chairman of Fiat!

526
00:29:08,172 --> 00:29:10,308
Agnelli!

527
00:29:10,876 --> 00:29:13,344
I have photographs for you to see.

528
00:29:20,485 --> 00:29:21,519
<i>Pronto.</i>

529
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,352
<i>Pronto.</i>

530
00:29:23,354 --> 00:29:24,994
Yes, I am here.

531
00:29:27,793 --> 00:29:29,069
Do you have something to say?

532
00:29:29,093 --> 00:29:32,530
Enzo maintains full control.

533
00:29:34,031 --> 00:29:36,334
I get the company for 18 million.

534
00:29:38,971 --> 00:29:40,671
All done, thank you.

535
00:29:56,187 --> 00:29:57,264
"Gentlemen,

536
00:29:57,288 --> 00:29:58,356
"only one small question.

537
00:29:58,456 --> 00:29:59,758
It concerns my race program."

538
00:30:09,534 --> 00:30:12,036
"If I wish to race Le Mans,

539
00:30:12,136 --> 00:30:14,272
"and you do not wish
for me to race Le Mans...

540
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,440
"do we or do we not go?"

541
00:30:24,315 --> 00:30:28,319
Look, in that
highly unlikely scenario...

542
00:30:29,788 --> 00:30:31,656
if we just can't agree...

543
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:34,158
then, yes.
I mean, no.

544
00:30:35,192 --> 00:30:36,694
You are correct.

545
00:30:37,763 --> 00:30:38,764
You do not go.

546
00:30:56,782 --> 00:30:58,392
"My integrity as a constructor,

547
00:30:58,416 --> 00:30:59,885
"as a man, as an Italian,

548
00:30:59,985 --> 00:31:01,652
"is deeply insulted
by your proposal."

549
00:31:03,254 --> 00:31:04,899
"Go back to Michigan."

550
00:31:09,327 --> 00:31:11,138
"Back to your
big, ugly factory."

551
00:31:13,631 --> 00:31:15,075
"Back to your
big, ugly factory,

552
00:31:15,099 --> 00:31:16,310
"making its ugly, little cars."

553
00:31:23,842 --> 00:31:25,787
"Tell your pigheaded boss that

554
00:31:25,811 --> 00:31:31,248
"all his, uh, smug executives
are worthless sons of whores."

555
00:31:33,651 --> 00:31:36,454
Tell him he's not Henry Ford.

556
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,792
He's Henry Ford II.

557
00:31:43,729 --> 00:31:45,529
I'm starving. Let's go eat.

558
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:09,788
He played us.

559
00:32:10,521 --> 00:32:12,958
Old Man Enzo had no intention
of selling to us.

560
00:32:14,191 --> 00:32:16,828
He used us to up his price...

561
00:32:17,361 --> 00:32:19,965
embarrass our company
and insult your leadership.

562
00:32:20,631 --> 00:32:22,801
It was a bad idea
from the start.

563
00:32:31,475 --> 00:32:33,577
What exactly did he say?

564
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,320
He said Ford makes
ugly little cars,

565
00:32:43,421 --> 00:32:44,790
and we make 'em...

566
00:32:45,489 --> 00:32:47,224
in an ugly factory.

567
00:32:48,827 --> 00:32:52,430
He said our executives
are sons of whores.

568
00:32:56,001 --> 00:32:57,468
About me?

569
00:32:59,303 --> 00:33:00,872
He called you fat, sir.

570
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:05,209
Pigheaded.

571
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:07,645
Go on.

572
00:33:08,646 --> 00:33:10,749
He said you're not Henry Ford.

573
00:33:11,817 --> 00:33:13,484
You're Henry Ford II.

574
00:33:35,974 --> 00:33:39,376
I want the best engineers.

575
00:33:41,245 --> 00:33:42,748
The best drivers.

576
00:33:45,117 --> 00:33:46,885
I don't care what it costs.

577
00:33:50,222 --> 00:33:51,990
We're gonna build a race car.

578
00:33:58,562 --> 00:33:59,765
And we're gonna bury

579
00:33:59,865 --> 00:34:01,265
that goddamn greasy wop

580
00:34:01,365 --> 00:34:02,700
100 feet deep

581
00:34:02,801 --> 00:34:05,302
under the finish line
at Le Mans.

582
00:34:06,504 --> 00:34:09,340
And I will be there
to watch it.

583
00:34:10,142 --> 00:34:12,077
Here they come.
Go, go, go, go.

584
00:34:16,081 --> 00:34:17,081
Assholes.

585
00:34:17,149 --> 00:34:18,250
You're really pathetic.

586
00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:19,349
I'm so sorry, girls.

587
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,651
Charlie!

588
00:34:20,752 --> 00:34:22,854
Quit throwing crackers
at the girls all damn day.

589
00:34:22,954 --> 00:34:24,122
God damn it.

590
00:34:24,222 --> 00:34:25,262
Do I gotta deal with this?

591
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:26,892
It's already taken care of.

592
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:32,264
Sorry about that.
So, yeah, 289 cubic inch V8.

593
00:34:32,363 --> 00:34:33,497
Far out.

594
00:34:33,597 --> 00:34:35,432
Extensive rework
of AC Ace's front end.

595
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:37,501
And a stronger rear diff
to handle the torque.

596
00:34:37,601 --> 00:34:39,171
How's she handle
a quarter mile?

597
00:34:39,637 --> 00:34:41,973
Well, now, I'm not saying
you should go drag racing,

598
00:34:42,073 --> 00:34:43,507
but a quarter mile's 13.6.

599
00:34:43,607 --> 00:34:44,810
Yeah.

600
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:46,443
- Is that good?
- Oh, that's real good.

601
00:34:46,544 --> 00:34:49,513
He sold that same car
three times this week.

602
00:34:49,613 --> 00:34:51,750
- You take cash? Is cash okay?
- Cash is okay.

603
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:54,262
Yeah, mister, you just bought
yourself one hell of a sport car.

604
00:34:54,286 --> 00:34:55,653
All right.

605
00:34:56,822 --> 00:34:59,257
Tell you what,
I'm gonna... Phil!

606
00:34:59,356 --> 00:35:00,700
I'm gonna pass you off
to my colleague here.

607
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:02,027
He gonna take care of you.

608
00:35:02,127 --> 00:35:03,829
- Phil, Wyatt.
- Hello, Wyatt.

609
00:35:03,929 --> 00:35:05,396
I'm gonna steal him
for one second.

610
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:07,799
You take the payment.

611
00:35:07,899 --> 00:35:09,643
Whatever you do,
do not let him take that car.

612
00:35:09,667 --> 00:35:10,836
That's Jeff Blitzer's car.

613
00:35:10,936 --> 00:35:13,104
And Frank Collins'
and Steve McQueen's.

614
00:35:13,205 --> 00:35:15,406
Shit. I forgot about McQueen.

615
00:35:18,342 --> 00:35:19,577
Morning.

616
00:35:20,111 --> 00:35:21,345
Can I help you?

617
00:35:22,446 --> 00:35:23,748
Carroll Shelby?

618
00:35:24,883 --> 00:35:25,917
Maybe.

619
00:35:27,351 --> 00:35:29,821
Lee Iacocca, Ford Motor.

620
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:34,625
What's with the wrench?

621
00:35:35,126 --> 00:35:36,995
That? Oh, long story.

622
00:35:37,796 --> 00:35:40,866
We are just going from strength
to strength here, Lee.

623
00:35:41,398 --> 00:35:44,069
Terrific sales,
we're killing it on the track.

624
00:35:44,169 --> 00:35:45,569
Now, I know I owe Ford

625
00:35:45,669 --> 00:35:46,747
for that last batch
of engines...

626
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:48,306
Mr. Shelby,
I can assure you

627
00:35:48,405 --> 00:35:49,506
I'm not here for money

628
00:35:49,607 --> 00:35:51,743
that you might owe Ford
for spare parts.

629
00:35:53,044 --> 00:35:54,478
You're not?

630
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,580
No, I'm not.

631
00:35:57,414 --> 00:35:58,682
Okay.

632
00:35:58,783 --> 00:36:01,452
I'm here on behalf
of Mr. Ford, Henry Ford II.

633
00:36:01,552 --> 00:36:04,222
Suppose, um, hypothetically,

634
00:36:04,322 --> 00:36:06,291
that he wanted his company

635
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,525
to win the 24 Hours
of Le Mans.

636
00:36:09,593 --> 00:36:10,996
You're one
of the only Americans

637
00:36:11,096 --> 00:36:12,529
that's ever done it...

638
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,032
so I'm wondering...

639
00:36:14,933 --> 00:36:16,067
what's it take?

640
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,805
Hypothetically?

641
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,174
Hypothetically.

642
00:36:24,508 --> 00:36:26,477
It takes something
money can't buy.

643
00:36:27,544 --> 00:36:29,014
Money can buy speed.

644
00:36:30,547 --> 00:36:32,416
But it isn't about speed, Lee.

645
00:36:33,385 --> 00:36:35,020
It's not just like
those other tracks

646
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:38,455
where all you do is turn
to the left for four hours.

647
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:42,193
To win that race,
you need a car

648
00:36:42,294 --> 00:36:44,595
that's light enough to do 200
on the straightaways

649
00:36:44,695 --> 00:36:45,907
but strong enough
to keep that up

650
00:36:45,931 --> 00:36:47,999
for 3,000 miles
without a break.

651
00:36:50,035 --> 00:36:51,770
Not just the best car

652
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,671
y'all have ever made,
but better than anything

653
00:36:53,772 --> 00:36:55,673
that Enzo Ferrari
shows up with that year.

654
00:36:55,774 --> 00:36:57,474
And that just gets you
to the green flag.

655
00:36:57,574 --> 00:36:59,543
That's where your problems
really start.

656
00:37:01,512 --> 00:37:03,148
Is everything okay?

657
00:37:03,248 --> 00:37:05,216
Go away.

658
00:37:12,556 --> 00:37:14,558
So you're saying
it's challenging.

659
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:19,097
Look, it's not even
a track, Lee.

660
00:37:19,764 --> 00:37:22,100
Le Mans is eight and a half
miles of country road.

661
00:37:23,435 --> 00:37:26,704
It's narrow, ungraded,
it's rough.

662
00:37:26,805 --> 00:37:29,874
There's no camber
on the turns, no rails.

663
00:37:32,476 --> 00:37:34,245
You gotta do that
for 24 hours.

664
00:37:36,147 --> 00:37:37,614
Twenty-four hours, Lee.

665
00:37:39,583 --> 00:37:40,718
That means night.

666
00:37:41,252 --> 00:37:44,488
Half that race is in the dark.
You can't see shit.

667
00:37:46,024 --> 00:37:48,126
Cars coming up on you
out of nowhere.

668
00:37:49,593 --> 00:37:52,663
Drivers stumbling around
the track, pouring blood.

669
00:37:53,465 --> 00:37:55,266
Maybe one of 'em
is your friend. Maybe...

670
00:37:56,234 --> 00:37:57,701
Maybe he's on fire.

671
00:37:59,437 --> 00:38:01,373
You're exhausted,
you're hungry...

672
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,476
can't remember your name,
what country you're in.

673
00:38:05,343 --> 00:38:08,947
And all of a sudden, you realize
you're doing 198 on a straight.

674
00:38:12,683 --> 00:38:14,252
And if anything goes wrong...

675
00:38:15,086 --> 00:38:18,056
you blow a gasket,
a five-cent washer...

676
00:38:18,555 --> 00:38:20,225
that's it, whole thing's over.

677
00:38:21,259 --> 00:38:22,559
Ferrari wins again.

678
00:38:23,395 --> 00:38:25,964
Just like he won last year
and the year before that.

679
00:38:26,297 --> 00:38:27,732
And the year before that.

680
00:38:31,469 --> 00:38:32,703
Yeah.

681
00:38:33,304 --> 00:38:34,538
It's challenging.

682
00:38:35,774 --> 00:38:37,175
So you don't think...

683
00:38:37,876 --> 00:38:39,210
that Ford Motor Company
can build

684
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:41,545
the greatest race car
the world's ever seen?

685
00:38:41,645 --> 00:38:44,182
You think that
we are incapable

686
00:38:44,516 --> 00:38:46,017
of winning an event like that?

687
00:38:46,418 --> 00:38:48,619
Even if we had
a brilliant partner?

688
00:38:51,356 --> 00:38:54,959
Even if we wrote a, uh,
blank check?

689
00:39:01,299 --> 00:39:04,635
What I'm saying is,
you can't buy a win, Lee.

690
00:39:07,405 --> 00:39:11,276
But maybe you could buy
the guy who gets you a shot.

691
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:15,579
<i>♪ Have love ♪</i>

692
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,084
<i>♪ Whoa, baby, will travel ♪</i>

693
00:39:21,252 --> 00:39:22,653
<i>♪ Have love ♪</i>

694
00:39:23,822 --> 00:39:26,157
<i>♪ Whoa, baby, will travel... ♪</i>

695
00:39:28,293 --> 00:39:32,764
A new transmission, axles,
shocks all around,

696
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:36,167
ditch the body and the tires,
you have yourself a contender.

697
00:39:37,235 --> 00:39:39,437
Anything on this beauty
that does work?

698
00:39:39,537 --> 00:39:42,207
The mirrors are outstanding.

699
00:39:42,307 --> 00:39:43,541
I saw that walking up.

700
00:39:44,309 --> 00:39:48,645
So, what, you just passing
on an evening stroll?

701
00:39:49,347 --> 00:39:51,983
Actually, Bulldog,
I have a proposition for you.

702
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:56,221
You're gonna build a car
to beat Old Man Ferrari...

703
00:39:56,321 --> 00:39:58,089
- Yeah.
- ...with Ford?

704
00:39:58,189 --> 00:40:00,325
With a Ford?

705
00:40:00,425 --> 00:40:01,692
Correct.

706
00:40:01,793 --> 00:40:03,633
And how long did you tell them
that you needed?

707
00:40:03,728 --> 00:40:05,396
Two, three hundred years?

708
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:06,998
Ninety days.

709
00:40:10,969 --> 00:40:13,938
All right, so let's just look
at this for a moment.

710
00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:16,174
And for argument's sake,

711
00:40:16,274 --> 00:40:18,743
let's just forget about
the whole 90-day thing.

712
00:40:18,843 --> 00:40:20,554
So let's just pretend you've got
all the money in the world

713
00:40:20,578 --> 00:40:22,614
and all the time in the world.

714
00:40:22,713 --> 00:40:24,415
- I like the sound of that.
- All right.

715
00:40:24,516 --> 00:40:25,583
So...

716
00:40:26,151 --> 00:40:29,087
you think that Ford
are gonna let you build

717
00:40:29,888 --> 00:40:32,723
the car that you want...

718
00:40:33,258 --> 00:40:34,792
the way you want it?

719
00:40:34,893 --> 00:40:37,896
The Ford Motor Company?

720
00:40:39,097 --> 00:40:40,231
Those guys?

721
00:40:41,466 --> 00:40:42,666
Have you ever been to Detroit?

722
00:40:42,699 --> 00:40:45,637
They have floors
and floors of lawyers

723
00:40:45,737 --> 00:40:47,572
and millions
of marketing guys,

724
00:40:47,671 --> 00:40:48,883
and they're all gonna want
to meet you.

725
00:40:48,907 --> 00:40:50,451
They're gonna want
to get their photo taken

726
00:40:50,475 --> 00:40:51,619
with the great
Carroll Shelby,

727
00:40:51,643 --> 00:40:52,843
and they're gonna
kiss your ass

728
00:40:52,877 --> 00:40:54,357
and go back
to their lovely offices...

729
00:40:54,879 --> 00:40:56,915
and they're gonna work out
new ways to screw you.

730
00:40:57,015 --> 00:40:59,683
Why? Because
they can't help it.

731
00:40:59,784 --> 00:41:01,395
Because they just want
to please their boss

732
00:41:01,419 --> 00:41:04,756
who wants please his boss
who wants to please his boss.

733
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:07,592
And they hate themselves
for it.

734
00:41:07,691 --> 00:41:09,394
But deep down...

735
00:41:09,494 --> 00:41:11,396
who they hate even more

736
00:41:11,496 --> 00:41:12,664
are guys like you,

737
00:41:12,764 --> 00:41:14,032
because you're not like them,

738
00:41:14,132 --> 00:41:15,767
because you don't think
like them,

739
00:41:15,867 --> 00:41:17,902
because you're different.

740
00:41:19,137 --> 00:41:21,072
It's coming straight
from the Deuce.

741
00:41:23,575 --> 00:41:24,676
He's serious.

742
00:41:24,976 --> 00:41:26,253
They're gonna put
real money behind it.

743
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:31,115
I'll bet they are.

744
00:41:32,283 --> 00:41:33,518
You know why?

745
00:41:33,618 --> 00:41:36,020
Because someone,
and I'm not saying who,

746
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:42,093
someone has told them that
this is actually possible.

747
00:41:42,427 --> 00:41:43,461
Look...

748
00:41:43,561 --> 00:41:45,096
this Sunday at Cloverfield,

749
00:41:45,196 --> 00:41:46,564
they're launching
the new Mustang.

750
00:41:46,664 --> 00:41:48,299
They're gonna announce
the race program.

751
00:41:49,567 --> 00:41:50,868
Just come on by.

752
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:55,773
Come take a look.
Listen to my speech.

753
00:41:56,307 --> 00:41:57,307
I'm making a speech.

754
00:41:57,675 --> 00:41:59,811
Bring Peter. He'll love it.

755
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:03,248
All right, Shel.

756
00:42:05,483 --> 00:42:07,085
See you Sunday.

757
00:42:10,288 --> 00:42:11,756
Whoa.

758
00:42:12,357 --> 00:42:15,226
Dad, look at that.

759
00:42:16,327 --> 00:42:17,495
Huh.

760
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:21,499
The Ford Mustang.
What do you think?

761
00:42:24,869 --> 00:42:26,971
I think
it's a secretary's car.

762
00:42:28,673 --> 00:42:30,108
I like it.

763
00:42:31,776 --> 00:42:32,776
Oh.

764
00:42:32,844 --> 00:42:34,545
Excu... Excuse me.

765
00:42:36,247 --> 00:42:37,982
Would you,
would you not do that?

766
00:42:38,516 --> 00:42:40,518
Oh. Sorry.

767
00:42:43,721 --> 00:42:46,391
Oh, er, is this,
is this your son?

768
00:42:47,258 --> 00:42:48,459
Yes, it is.

769
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:51,229
Would you ask him to keep
his hands off the paintwork?

770
00:42:51,764 --> 00:42:52,797
No, no, no, Peter.

771
00:42:52,897 --> 00:42:54,265
You're okay.
Who are you?

772
00:42:54,767 --> 00:42:57,702
Leo Beebe, senior executive vice
president, Ford Motor Company.

773
00:42:57,802 --> 00:42:58,803
Ah.

774
00:42:58,903 --> 00:43:00,138
I'm responsible for the launch

775
00:43:00,238 --> 00:43:01,103
of the Mustang.

776
00:43:01,105 --> 00:43:02,741
Ah! At least now we know

777
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,875
who's responsible.

778
00:43:03,975 --> 00:43:05,015
Don't get me wrong, Lenny.

779
00:43:05,076 --> 00:43:07,979
- Leo.
- It looks fantastic.

780
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,014
But inside,
it's a lump of lard

781
00:43:10,114 --> 00:43:11,449
dressed up to fool the public.

782
00:43:11,549 --> 00:43:13,484
My advice is,

783
00:43:13,584 --> 00:43:14,986
lose the inline-six

784
00:43:15,086 --> 00:43:16,721
and that idiotic
three-speed,

785
00:43:16,821 --> 00:43:20,391
shorten the wheelbase,
somehow lose half a ton,

786
00:43:20,491 --> 00:43:21,659
and lower the price.

787
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,760
Dad.

788
00:43:22,827 --> 00:43:23,895
But even then,

789
00:43:23,995 --> 00:43:25,563
I'd still choose
a Chevy Chevelle.

790
00:43:26,664 --> 00:43:29,334
And that's
a fucking terrible car.

791
00:43:30,501 --> 00:43:32,337
<i>How are we doing
up there, Steve?</i>

792
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:34,539
There's Cloverfield,
Mr. Shelby.

793
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,674
Oh, yeah.

794
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:39,177
You mind if I take
a shot at the landing?

795
00:43:39,277 --> 00:43:40,477
Uh...

796
00:43:40,545 --> 00:43:41,679
No, no, no. I mean it.

797
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,614
I flew B-29s
out of San Antone in '44.

798
00:43:43,715 --> 00:43:44,949
You're kidding.

799
00:43:45,316 --> 00:43:46,884
- I did.
- Okay.

800
00:43:46,984 --> 00:43:48,152
Carroll, what are you doing?

801
00:43:48,252 --> 00:43:49,863
- Does he know how to fly?
- Carroll.

802
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:52,457
I had an instructor tell me,
he said...

803
00:43:52,557 --> 00:43:54,926
Don, I would say it's probably
a good time to buckle up.

804
00:43:55,026 --> 00:43:57,095
"...do everybody a favor,
stay on the ground."

805
00:43:58,096 --> 00:43:59,497
That's a true story.

806
00:43:59,597 --> 00:44:00,797
- Oh, no.
- Oh, shit.

807
00:44:00,865 --> 00:44:02,567
- God damn it.
- Here we go.

808
00:44:02,667 --> 00:44:03,827
<i>This is the car</i>

809
00:44:03,901 --> 00:44:05,804
<i>you never expected
from Detroit.</i>

810
00:44:08,841 --> 00:44:11,476
All right. Let's go.

811
00:44:13,378 --> 00:44:14,780
Not staying, Ken?

812
00:44:15,279 --> 00:44:17,750
Ah, it's a bloody pig
in a poke, isn't it?

813
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:19,090
Oh, here they come now.

814
00:44:23,888 --> 00:44:26,524
- Wait. Are they crashing?
- Oh, Lord.

815
00:44:26,624 --> 00:44:27,992
Who's the pilot?

816
00:44:28,092 --> 00:44:30,027
My guess, Peter...

817
00:44:33,097 --> 00:44:34,499
it's someone we know.

818
00:44:35,868 --> 00:44:37,228
<i>Everything all right
up there?</i>

819
00:44:37,736 --> 00:44:39,103
Oh, no.

820
00:44:39,203 --> 00:44:40,538
- No!
- Hang on.

821
00:44:40,638 --> 00:44:43,074
Oh, shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

822
00:44:43,174 --> 00:44:46,745
Shit. Shit. Shit.

823
00:44:46,845 --> 00:44:48,679
Tell you what,
that's like riding a bike.

824
00:44:55,386 --> 00:44:56,822
Talk about making an entrance.

825
00:44:56,921 --> 00:44:58,689
- Shelby...
- Good grief.

826
00:44:58,791 --> 00:45:00,234
- Shelby!
- All right!

827
00:45:00,258 --> 00:45:02,460
- Over here. Over here!
- Shelby!

828
00:45:02,693 --> 00:45:03,896
How y'all doing?

829
00:45:03,995 --> 00:45:05,172
Can I get
your autograph, please?

830
00:45:05,196 --> 00:45:06,373
Can I get
your autograph, sir?

831
00:45:06,397 --> 00:45:07,866
Carroll,
this is Roy Lunn.

832
00:45:07,965 --> 00:45:09,133
Old Roy here is developing

833
00:45:09,233 --> 00:45:10,468
the prototype over in England.

834
00:45:10,568 --> 00:45:12,738
Oh, hell, I know Roy.
Good to see you, Roy.

835
00:45:12,838 --> 00:45:14,138
Welcome
to the madhouse, Shelby.

836
00:45:14,238 --> 00:45:15,850
Ford wheeled out the entire
executive committee

837
00:45:15,874 --> 00:45:16,874
for this one.

838
00:45:16,941 --> 00:45:18,376
Hold that thought.

839
00:45:18,877 --> 00:45:19,843
Ah.

840
00:45:19,845 --> 00:45:21,212
Hello, Mr. Lindbergh.

841
00:45:21,312 --> 00:45:23,749
You like that?
Hey, Peter, how you doing?

842
00:45:23,849 --> 00:45:25,225
- Mr. Shelby.
- Good to see you.

843
00:45:25,249 --> 00:45:27,552
Are you building a car
that's gonna beat Ferrari?

844
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:31,155
Well, we're gonna go
to Le Mans, that's for sure.

845
00:45:31,255 --> 00:45:33,367
And if we get across that finish
line first, we're gonna win.

846
00:45:33,391 --> 00:45:35,293
Carroll, allow me
to introduce Leo Beebe,

847
00:45:35,393 --> 00:45:37,428
senior vice president,
Ford Motor.

848
00:45:37,528 --> 00:45:39,096
Oh, sure. Yeah.
A pleasure, Mr. Beebe.

849
00:45:39,197 --> 00:45:40,775
- Thank you for coming.
- Say hello to Ken Miles

850
00:45:40,799 --> 00:45:41,966
- and his son, Peter.
- Yeah.

851
00:45:42,066 --> 00:45:44,569
- We've, um... we met.
- We, uh... we met.

852
00:45:45,403 --> 00:45:46,571
Yeah.

853
00:45:47,104 --> 00:45:48,339
Didn't we?

854
00:45:48,439 --> 00:45:50,308
So, um, well...

855
00:45:50,776 --> 00:45:52,778
I'll take Petey for some pop.

856
00:45:53,377 --> 00:45:55,146
Good luck
with these guys, Shel.

857
00:45:55,246 --> 00:45:57,215
- Bye, Mr. Shelby.
- See you, Pete.

858
00:45:57,816 --> 00:45:59,417
Don't worry, he's gonna stay.

859
00:46:00,451 --> 00:46:03,254
So, you two get a chance
to talk on the plane?

860
00:46:04,155 --> 00:46:05,356
Yeah. Uh...

861
00:46:05,656 --> 00:46:08,626
Carroll, why don't we just
step this way for a second?

862
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:17,368
Look, it's pro forma.
It's window dressing.

863
00:46:17,468 --> 00:46:19,213
But there's gotta be
a sense of give-and-take

864
00:46:19,237 --> 00:46:20,571
between you and...

865
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,940
you know.

866
00:46:22,039 --> 00:46:23,039
No, I don't.

867
00:46:23,107 --> 00:46:24,342
The group.

868
00:46:24,442 --> 00:46:25,543
The group?

869
00:46:25,643 --> 00:46:26,653
Senior creatives, Carroll.

870
00:46:26,677 --> 00:46:29,146
Just to make sure
everybody's comfortable.

871
00:46:29,714 --> 00:46:30,816
Well, I'm confused, Lee.

872
00:46:30,916 --> 00:46:32,450
'Cause up until
this moment, right now,

873
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:33,785
I was comfortable.

874
00:46:34,585 --> 00:46:36,855
You should take a look
out there, Carroll. Hmm?

875
00:46:36,955 --> 00:46:38,422
What do you see?

876
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:39,992
You know what I see?

877
00:46:40,091 --> 00:46:41,559
I see a machine.

878
00:46:41,659 --> 00:46:43,661
I see 10,000 moving parts,

879
00:46:43,762 --> 00:46:44,930
moving hopefully in harmony,

880
00:46:45,029 --> 00:46:46,464
and it's my job to make it so.

881
00:46:46,564 --> 00:46:48,000
It's my job
to guide you through it.

882
00:46:48,099 --> 00:46:50,034
I am here
to help you, Carroll.

883
00:46:50,134 --> 00:46:51,770
But you gotta trust me.

884
00:46:52,771 --> 00:46:54,006
- Excuse me, Lee.
- Carroll...

885
00:46:54,672 --> 00:46:56,550
do not step on that stage
if you don't trust me.

886
00:46:56,574 --> 00:46:59,477
<i>Please welcome
Mr. Carroll Shelby.</i>

887
00:46:59,577 --> 00:47:00,979
Gotta go.

888
00:47:03,815 --> 00:47:06,250
Shelby... Oh.
Shelby.

889
00:47:07,718 --> 00:47:08,754
What'd he say?

890
00:47:08,854 --> 00:47:10,187
He gets the drill.

891
00:47:13,257 --> 00:47:15,126
<i>Thank you.</i>

892
00:47:15,226 --> 00:47:17,395
<i>Well, if my daddy
was here today...</i>

893
00:47:17,495 --> 00:47:19,163
<i>he'd tell me to sit on down</i>

894
00:47:19,263 --> 00:47:22,300
<i>and leave the yakking
to the college boys...</i>

895
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,569
<i>so, like my cars,
I'll make this fast.</i>

896
00:47:26,939 --> 00:47:29,640
<i>When I was 10 years old,
Pops said to me, "Son...</i>

897
00:47:30,308 --> 00:47:32,176
<i>"it's a truly lucky man</i>

898
00:47:32,276 --> 00:47:34,478
<i>"who knows what he wants
to do in this world.</i>

899
00:47:34,579 --> 00:47:37,648
<i>"'Cause that man will
never work a day in his life."</i>

900
00:47:37,749 --> 00:47:40,384
<i>But there are a few,
a precious few,</i>

901
00:47:40,484 --> 00:47:42,620
<i>and, hell, I don't know
if they're lucky or not.</i>

902
00:47:43,454 --> 00:47:44,589
<i>But there are a few people</i>

903
00:47:44,689 --> 00:47:46,390
<i>who find something
they have to do.</i>

904
00:47:47,793 --> 00:47:49,427
<i>Something obsesses 'em.</i>

905
00:47:50,461 --> 00:47:52,229
<i>Something that
if they can't do it,</i>

906
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:54,332
<i>it's gonna drive them
clean out of their mind.</i>

907
00:47:55,366 --> 00:47:57,602
<i>I'm that guy.</i>

908
00:47:57,702 --> 00:48:00,504
<i>And I know one other man
feels exactly the same.</i>

909
00:48:02,007 --> 00:48:03,274
<i>His name...</i>

910
00:48:05,509 --> 00:48:07,378
<i>His name is Mr. Henry Ford.</i>

911
00:48:07,478 --> 00:48:10,114
Yeah! Whoo!

912
00:48:12,084 --> 00:48:13,752
<i>And together,
we're gonna build</i>

913
00:48:13,852 --> 00:48:15,821
<i>the fastest automobiles
in the world.</i>

914
00:48:19,024 --> 00:48:21,827
<i>And we're gonna make history,
too, at Le Mans.</i>

915
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:27,465
- Let's go.
- What?

916
00:48:27,565 --> 00:48:29,367
<i>My name is Carroll Shelby.</i>

917
00:48:30,068 --> 00:48:31,602
<i>I build race cars.</i>

918
00:48:54,993 --> 00:48:56,795
No. Whatever it is, no.

919
00:48:59,031 --> 00:49:00,231
No.

920
00:49:01,099 --> 00:49:02,134
Thirty minutes.

921
00:49:02,433 --> 00:49:05,269
Ah, just... I'm spent.

922
00:49:05,369 --> 00:49:07,873
- I wanna have a bath.
- You're gonna wanna see this.

923
00:49:08,774 --> 00:49:09,875
Trust me.

924
00:49:10,876 --> 00:49:13,711
Thirty minutes. I'll have you
back for meatloaf and gravy.

925
00:49:16,915 --> 00:49:18,083
Thirty minutes.

926
00:49:18,182 --> 00:49:19,617
Yeah.

927
00:49:38,036 --> 00:49:39,570
Bloody hell.

928
00:49:45,409 --> 00:49:47,145
Fresh off the plane
from England.

929
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:53,217
Now, she's still a little
on the rare side of cooked.

930
00:50:02,693 --> 00:50:04,228
Whoa! Come on.

931
00:50:16,808 --> 00:50:18,342
Interesting.

932
00:50:35,127 --> 00:50:36,127
Well?

933
00:50:36,161 --> 00:50:37,394
It's awful.

934
00:50:37,495 --> 00:50:38,897
It's worse than awful.

935
00:50:38,997 --> 00:50:40,297
Yeah, it doesn't track.

936
00:50:40,397 --> 00:50:42,768
You know,
the third gear is too high.

937
00:50:43,601 --> 00:50:46,270
Torque is not reaching
the road.

938
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:50,274
Steering's loose because
the front end gets light.

939
00:50:50,374 --> 00:50:52,778
And over 140,
it thinks it's a...

940
00:50:52,878 --> 00:50:53,878
Airplane.

941
00:50:53,912 --> 00:50:55,113
Yeah.

942
00:50:55,213 --> 00:50:57,448
It wants to lift off
and fly to Hawaii.

943
00:51:00,152 --> 00:51:01,452
Anything else?

944
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:08,692
One sec.

945
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:40,292
You were back late last night.

946
00:51:40,391 --> 00:51:41,659
Yeah.

947
00:51:45,263 --> 00:51:47,732
- Were you working?
- Mmm.

948
00:51:51,136 --> 00:51:52,636
So, you didn't go anyplace?

949
00:51:53,704 --> 00:51:54,940
What?

950
00:51:56,707 --> 00:51:58,977
Well, I'm asking, did you
go anyplace last night?

951
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:02,881
Mollie.

952
00:52:03,181 --> 00:52:04,783
It's a simple question.

953
00:52:07,118 --> 00:52:08,753
And I answered, didn't I?

954
00:52:09,154 --> 00:52:10,554
What was the answer?

955
00:52:12,389 --> 00:52:13,624
Is something up, love?

956
00:52:15,961 --> 00:52:17,370
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

957
00:52:17,394 --> 00:52:19,130
You're driving very fast.

958
00:52:19,231 --> 00:52:20,332
Oh, am I? Am I?

959
00:52:20,431 --> 00:52:21,733
Yes, you are.

960
00:52:23,969 --> 00:52:25,871
Bloody hell! What are you...
The hell is this?

961
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:28,139
Well, you tell me,
'cause I don't know.

962
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,275
Right, slow down!

963
00:52:30,374 --> 00:52:32,143
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Mollie!

964
00:52:34,678 --> 00:52:36,915
Please slow it down,
all right?

965
00:52:37,015 --> 00:52:38,817
You trying to kill us
or something?

966
00:52:38,917 --> 00:52:40,919
- Well, I thought we love this shit.
- What?

967
00:52:42,821 --> 00:52:45,389
- Bloody hell!
- It's a bit of racing fun. No?

968
00:52:45,489 --> 00:52:46,834
No, no, no.
It's not the same at all.

969
00:52:46,858 --> 00:52:48,994
Well, I think it's thrilling!

970
00:52:49,493 --> 00:52:50,962
All right.

971
00:52:51,062 --> 00:52:52,764
Look, I saw you, all right?

972
00:52:53,999 --> 00:52:56,400
I saw you leaving with Shelby,
and I saw you coming back.

973
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,169
Okay. Shit.
Okay, but slow it...

974
00:52:58,270 --> 00:53:00,805
And then all day you've got
that stupid look on your face.

975
00:53:00,906 --> 00:53:03,141
Mollie, slow down.
You're too close here.

976
00:53:05,877 --> 00:53:08,479
Mollie, put on the brakes
right now...

977
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:10,681
Not until you tell me
what's going on!

978
00:53:10,782 --> 00:53:13,218
All right.
I went to look at a car.

979
00:53:13,318 --> 00:53:15,186
- With Shelby?
- With Shelby.

980
00:53:15,287 --> 00:53:17,488
- A racing car?
- Sort of.

981
00:53:18,489 --> 00:53:20,524
There's a corner coming.
You'd better hold on.

982
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,495
Oh! Are you gonna lift your
foot off at all through this?

983
00:53:24,595 --> 00:53:26,164
No, 'cause I like
a clean racing line.

984
00:53:26,264 --> 00:53:27,299
Slow down!

985
00:53:31,303 --> 00:53:32,303
Okay.

986
00:53:32,304 --> 00:53:33,805
Shel offered me a job.

987
00:53:33,905 --> 00:53:37,242
Ford has a car that they want
to put up against a Ferrari.

988
00:53:37,342 --> 00:53:39,287
- You told me you were done.
- That's it. Now, slow...

989
00:53:39,311 --> 00:53:40,845
I didn't say yes.

990
00:53:40,946 --> 00:53:42,247
Slow down.

991
00:53:42,347 --> 00:53:43,915
You told me you quit.

992
00:53:44,883 --> 00:53:47,419
- I don't understand.
- Get fat and old, you said.

993
00:53:47,518 --> 00:53:49,120
Fat and old.

994
00:53:53,024 --> 00:53:54,601
- I don't understand.
- That's what you told me.

995
00:53:54,625 --> 00:53:56,328
I don't understand.

996
00:53:56,428 --> 00:53:57,939
Are you upset
because I said I was done

997
00:53:57,963 --> 00:54:00,765
or because
I looked at a race car?

998
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,769
Just don't lie to me, Ken.

999
00:54:06,204 --> 00:54:07,806
Don't make it a secret,

1000
00:54:07,906 --> 00:54:09,207
what you want
or what you feel,

1001
00:54:09,307 --> 00:54:12,243
just because you think
it's gonna make me happy.

1002
00:54:14,346 --> 00:54:16,580
Moll, I don't even know
what I feel.

1003
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,123
If you do this...

1004
00:54:27,792 --> 00:54:30,061
then he better be
paying you this time.

1005
00:54:32,197 --> 00:54:35,233
'Cause I can't work any more
hours and look after Peter.

1006
00:54:35,333 --> 00:54:36,667
You know,
the IRS have the garage.

1007
00:54:36,768 --> 00:54:39,037
I'm not losing my home.

1008
00:54:39,636 --> 00:54:41,572
It's 200 a day.

1009
00:54:44,242 --> 00:54:45,877
Plus expenses.

1010
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:49,948
Are you shitting me?

1011
00:54:50,315 --> 00:54:52,649
But I haven't decided.

1012
00:54:55,353 --> 00:54:56,955
$200 a day?

1013
00:54:59,523 --> 00:55:00,859
Are you nuts?

1014
00:55:24,182 --> 00:55:27,285
Look at this.
This is ridiculous. Here.

1015
00:55:27,385 --> 00:55:30,422
So, Shel, grabbing air.

1016
00:55:30,522 --> 00:55:32,057
That's the problem.

1017
00:55:32,757 --> 00:55:36,428
Over 90, air's getting in,
not getting out.

1018
00:55:36,528 --> 00:55:38,430
It's the nose,
I can feel it in the wheel.

1019
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:39,672
Mr. Miles,
if there's a problem,

1020
00:55:39,696 --> 00:55:40,736
the computer will find it.

1021
00:55:40,832 --> 00:55:42,000
- All right.
- Charlie,

1022
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:44,635
get some Scotch tape
and a ball of wool.

1023
00:55:45,569 --> 00:55:47,739
All right. Good, good, good.

1024
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:51,642
So, now let's just, uh,
get all of this junk out.

1025
00:55:51,743 --> 00:55:52,777
Right, Pops?

1026
00:55:52,877 --> 00:55:54,245
Yeah, yeah. I concur.

1027
00:55:54,345 --> 00:55:55,712
Come on, guys.

1028
00:55:57,982 --> 00:55:59,217
What are they doing?

1029
00:55:59,751 --> 00:56:01,352
Making your car faster.

1030
00:56:09,127 --> 00:56:10,228
There. Right there.

1031
00:56:10,328 --> 00:56:11,595
Airflow's getting stuck.

1032
00:56:14,598 --> 00:56:17,435
I see it.
Yarn blows straight up.

1033
00:56:17,535 --> 00:56:19,080
- Yep.
- The front's lifting.

1034
00:56:19,104 --> 00:56:20,738
Damn, he's right.

1035
00:56:31,216 --> 00:56:34,552
This car wants to go faster.
I feel it.

1036
00:56:34,651 --> 00:56:36,554
Any lighter,
we're getting fragile.

1037
00:56:37,021 --> 00:56:38,923
Took 70 pounds out of her
in the last week.

1038
00:56:39,023 --> 00:56:41,826
She's outputting max horsepower
from this displacement.

1039
00:56:41,926 --> 00:56:44,095
So put in a bigger engine.

1040
00:56:44,195 --> 00:56:45,997
Where we gonna put it?
On the roof?

1041
00:56:48,933 --> 00:56:50,677
Managed to make it
52 pounds lighter

1042
00:56:50,701 --> 00:56:52,669
than the NASCAR unit.

1043
00:56:57,108 --> 00:56:59,577
All-new aluminum
cylinder heads...

1044
00:57:00,245 --> 00:57:03,448
vibration dampeners,
water pump, smaller valves.

1045
00:57:03,781 --> 00:57:05,283
We call it the Beast.

1046
00:57:05,917 --> 00:57:07,218
Yeah, I can see why,

1047
00:57:07,318 --> 00:57:08,419
but how's it gonna fit

1048
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,488
without a redesign
of the engine bed?

1049
00:57:10,588 --> 00:57:11,765
Well, it certainly
wasn't easy.

1050
00:57:11,789 --> 00:57:13,033
Good morning, gentlemen.
Mr. Shelby.

1051
00:57:13,057 --> 00:57:17,195
So, you already put that
in a GT40?

1052
00:57:17,495 --> 00:57:19,696
I'm afraid we have.

1053
00:57:25,303 --> 00:57:26,838
I'll be damned.

1054
00:57:27,405 --> 00:57:28,773
Well, it's heavy, of course.

1055
00:57:28,873 --> 00:57:30,217
Problems with the handling,
especially the stopping.

1056
00:57:30,241 --> 00:57:32,377
- I can show you the data.
- What problems?

1057
00:57:32,477 --> 00:57:33,611
Understeers a little, but...

1058
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:35,313
Can I borrow that?

1059
00:57:35,413 --> 00:57:36,614
Just a second. Thank you.

1060
00:57:36,713 --> 00:57:37,713
Ken!

1061
00:57:38,416 --> 00:57:41,619
Ken, perhaps you want to check
with HQ before you test...

1062
00:57:41,718 --> 00:57:43,087
What did he say?

1063
00:57:43,188 --> 00:57:44,431
We should ask...

1064
00:57:44,455 --> 00:57:45,689
Right.

1065
00:57:47,859 --> 00:57:50,995
Oh, yes!

1066
00:57:58,136 --> 00:58:00,638
Mr. Shelby,
welcome to Dearborn.

1067
00:58:00,738 --> 00:58:02,106
What are you doing
at a test track?

1068
00:58:02,207 --> 00:58:04,442
You're gonna get Castrol oil
all over that nice suit.

1069
00:58:04,542 --> 00:58:05,862
Ah, I wanted to hear
your thoughts

1070
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:07,030
on a few planning decisions.

1071
00:58:07,111 --> 00:58:08,680
You know,
personnel for Le Mans.

1072
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:10,291
Well,
it's a hell of a lineup.

1073
00:58:10,315 --> 00:58:12,050
Ken Miles, Phil Hill,

1074
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:13,918
Chris Amon, Bruce McLaren.

1075
00:58:14,018 --> 00:58:16,487
Hill's a lock.
Amon, McLaren, too.

1076
00:58:16,588 --> 00:58:18,323
We're less sure about Miles.

1077
00:58:18,423 --> 00:58:19,757
We like Richie Ginther...

1078
00:58:20,158 --> 00:58:22,727
Masten Gregory,
Bob Bondurant.

1079
00:58:23,261 --> 00:58:25,463
Well, you're gonna want
the best driver for the car.

1080
00:58:25,563 --> 00:58:27,165
Understands the machine.

1081
00:58:27,265 --> 00:58:28,566
That's Ken.

1082
00:58:28,666 --> 00:58:30,568
Oh! Yes!

1083
00:58:31,302 --> 00:58:34,772
More of that, please.
More of that, my girl.

1084
00:58:34,872 --> 00:58:37,208
I may not get the finer points
of racing, Mr. Shelby,

1085
00:58:37,308 --> 00:58:38,776
but I do know people.

1086
00:58:39,210 --> 00:58:40,278
Miles is a...

1087
00:58:40,712 --> 00:58:43,348
Well, he's a beatnik.
He dresses like one.

1088
00:58:44,048 --> 00:58:45,483
Ford means reliability.

1089
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:47,986
Ken Miles is not a Ford man.

1090
00:58:48,086 --> 00:58:49,721
Whoa!

1091
00:58:49,821 --> 00:58:51,856
Giddy-up! Giddy-up!

1092
00:58:54,993 --> 00:58:57,128
What's the lap record
here, Burt?

1093
00:58:57,228 --> 00:58:59,130
1:58.

1094
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:01,466
- 1:50 dead.
<i>- A beatnik?</i>

1095
00:59:01,566 --> 00:59:04,302
That man landed a busted tank
on the beach at D-Day

1096
00:59:04,402 --> 00:59:06,804
and drove it clean
across Europe to Berlin.

1097
00:59:07,472 --> 00:59:08,873
A beatnik?

1098
00:59:08,973 --> 00:59:10,384
You know, Lee here asked me
a while back,

1099
00:59:10,408 --> 00:59:12,410
"What's the one thing
money can't buy?"

1100
00:59:13,144 --> 00:59:14,445
I'll tell you what it is.

1101
00:59:14,912 --> 00:59:17,115
A pure racer
behind the wheel of your car.

1102
00:59:17,915 --> 00:59:19,417
That's Ken Miles.

1103
00:59:20,985 --> 00:59:22,820
Well, be that as it may...

1104
00:59:23,655 --> 00:59:25,456
we think he may be too pure.

1105
00:59:33,331 --> 00:59:36,901
Carroll, do not lose sight
of the big picture here.

1106
00:59:38,202 --> 00:59:39,404
"Too pure"?

1107
00:59:40,138 --> 00:59:41,973
What exactly does that mean?

1108
00:59:42,607 --> 00:59:44,108
It means
he's all about himself.

1109
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:47,879
ABC puts a microphone
under his nose,

1110
00:59:47,979 --> 00:59:50,315
perhaps there's a detail
he dislikes,

1111
00:59:50,415 --> 00:59:51,549
millions watching...

1112
00:59:51,649 --> 00:59:53,786
do you trust him not to
put out the wrong message?

1113
00:59:53,885 --> 00:59:55,386
Well, look, you can get
a clean-cut,

1114
00:59:55,486 --> 00:59:56,587
all-American poster boy

1115
00:59:56,688 --> 00:59:57,798
and stick him
behind the wheel,

1116
00:59:57,822 --> 00:59:59,057
teach him what to say.

1117
00:59:59,157 --> 01:00:00,825
Shit, you get Doris Day
to drive the car,

1118
01:00:00,925 --> 01:00:02,160
if all you want to do is lose.

1119
01:00:02,795 --> 01:00:05,830
So, you don't agree with us
on this issue?

1120
01:00:07,899 --> 01:00:10,201
I'm saying you gotta trust me
on this one.

1121
01:00:10,868 --> 01:00:12,112
Carroll,
with marketing concerns,

1122
01:00:12,136 --> 01:00:13,571
that's just not possible.

1123
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:18,943
Put a Ford-type driver
in a Ford car, Mr. Shelby.

1124
01:00:19,644 --> 01:00:21,179
That's the Ford way.

1125
01:00:27,685 --> 01:00:29,997
<i>Yet another
championship win for Ferrari</i>

1126
01:00:30,021 --> 01:00:31,723
<i>as British driver John Surtees</i>

1127
01:00:31,824 --> 01:00:33,491
<i>pilots his Ferrari 312...</i>

1128
01:00:33,591 --> 01:00:35,193
Ferrari wins.

1129
01:00:35,293 --> 01:00:37,862
<i>It's Surtees'
first win since the '64...</i>

1130
01:00:37,962 --> 01:00:39,765
Wedges. We have wedges.

1131
01:00:39,864 --> 01:00:41,834
Oh, good, good, good.

1132
01:00:41,933 --> 01:00:43,267
Perfect.

1133
01:00:44,068 --> 01:00:46,070
- 40?
- Yep.

1134
01:00:55,079 --> 01:00:56,481
- Hey, boss.
- Hey, Dan.

1135
01:00:56,581 --> 01:00:58,950
- Boss, Ferrari just bagged...
- You got a passport?

1136
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:00,050
What's that?

1137
01:01:00,084 --> 01:01:01,854
Sign that. Get a passport.

1138
01:01:01,953 --> 01:01:03,721
Get it back to me
by Friday. Frosty.

1139
01:01:03,822 --> 01:01:05,089
Boys, I'm going to France.

1140
01:01:07,258 --> 01:01:08,559
Phil.

1141
01:01:08,659 --> 01:01:10,261
Ken, can I get a word?

1142
01:01:16,667 --> 01:01:17,935
Oh.

1143
01:01:19,036 --> 01:01:20,505
Can I take this?

1144
01:01:20,605 --> 01:01:21,706
Hey.

1145
01:01:22,073 --> 01:01:25,143
Do you know why Ford named it
the GT40?

1146
01:01:25,243 --> 01:01:27,145
Why they put that "40"
on there?

1147
01:01:27,245 --> 01:01:29,180
- No.
- Regulations. All right?

1148
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,850
We gotta be 40 inches high

1149
01:01:31,949 --> 01:01:34,685
to make the ground
clearance requirements.

1150
01:01:34,787 --> 01:01:35,854
No more, no less.

1151
01:01:35,953 --> 01:01:37,355
They measure it
before every race.

1152
01:01:37,455 --> 01:01:40,391
Problem is,
that with that height,

1153
01:01:40,491 --> 01:01:43,561
there's too much drag
under the car, all right?

1154
01:01:43,661 --> 01:01:45,263
So, we have a solution.

1155
01:01:45,363 --> 01:01:47,064
Wedges. We put wedges
in the suspension...

1156
01:01:47,165 --> 01:01:49,033
You're not coming next week.

1157
01:01:51,737 --> 01:01:53,137
You're not coming, Ken.

1158
01:01:56,307 --> 01:01:59,243
We're taking McLaren,
Chris Amon, Phil Hill...

1159
01:02:00,445 --> 01:02:01,712
and Bob Bondurant.

1160
01:02:02,513 --> 01:02:04,148
It's Ford's call.

1161
01:02:05,349 --> 01:02:07,853
It is their opinion that
you are not a good image,

1162
01:02:07,952 --> 01:02:10,254
so you cannot drive
their race car.

1163
01:02:11,556 --> 01:02:13,300
And putting aside the fact
that you made that car

1164
01:02:13,324 --> 01:02:14,692
whatever the hell it is...

1165
01:02:15,393 --> 01:02:18,396
and you're the best man
I got behind the wheel...

1166
01:02:38,149 --> 01:02:40,051
I'm gonna reroute
the oil line.

1167
01:02:40,151 --> 01:02:41,954
If there's spillage,
it could drip

1168
01:02:42,053 --> 01:02:43,789
onto the rear nearside disc.

1169
01:02:43,889 --> 01:02:44,989
Ken...

1170
01:02:45,089 --> 01:02:46,157
Tell the boys

1171
01:02:46,257 --> 01:02:50,328
to watch their pace
come sunrise.

1172
01:02:50,428 --> 01:02:54,131
The, uh,
the gearbox will overheat.

1173
01:03:11,984 --> 01:03:13,184
Ken, the race
is starting soon.

1174
01:03:13,284 --> 01:03:14,753
Want it on the radio?

1175
01:03:14,853 --> 01:03:16,387
Not unless you do.

1176
01:03:35,306 --> 01:03:36,742
<i>...of the race.</i>

1177
01:03:36,842 --> 01:03:37,774
<i>There they are.</i>

1178
01:03:37,776 --> 01:03:39,096
<i>The Maserati going
into the Esses,</i>

1179
01:03:39,143 --> 01:03:40,220
<i>but it's still
the number 2 car,</i>

1180
01:03:40,244 --> 01:03:41,345
<i>driven by Chris Amon.</i>

1181
01:03:41,445 --> 01:03:43,314
<i>In third place
is the number 1 Ford</i>

1182
01:03:43,414 --> 01:03:45,049
<i>that is driven
by Bruce McLaren.</i>

1183
01:03:45,149 --> 01:03:47,485
<i>A tremendously fast start
for the Ford GT.</i>

1184
01:03:47,585 --> 01:03:51,522
<i>3:43.4 lap
for car number 2, a Ford.</i>

1185
01:03:51,622 --> 01:03:53,300
<i>I think
it's a little bit quick</i>

1186
01:03:53,324 --> 01:03:54,458
<i>for this stage of the game.</i>

1187
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:55,803
<i>Little bit quick right now.</i>

1188
01:03:55,827 --> 01:03:57,194
Racing too hot.

1189
01:03:58,462 --> 01:03:59,673
<i>This could go down</i>

1190
01:03:59,697 --> 01:04:01,241
<i>to the last hour or so,
don't you think?</i>

1191
01:04:01,265 --> 01:04:02,342
<i>It could,
but the probabilities</i>

1192
01:04:02,366 --> 01:04:03,434
<i>for a finish like that</i>

1193
01:04:03,534 --> 01:04:05,603
<i>in a 24-hour race
are awfully small.</i>

1194
01:04:05,703 --> 01:04:07,514
<i>Another Ford
has come into the pits.</i>

1195
01:04:07,538 --> 01:04:09,942
<i>It's being pushed into
the pits by the mechanics.</i>

1196
01:04:10,042 --> 01:04:11,509
Head gasket.

1197
01:04:12,176 --> 01:04:14,378
The car's not a moon rocket.

1198
01:04:14,478 --> 01:04:15,757
<i>Trailing
Bob Bondurant in fourth,</i>

1199
01:04:15,781 --> 01:04:16,815
<i>car number 7.</i>

1200
01:04:16,915 --> 01:04:19,985
<i>Leading number 20, Ferrari.
Michael Parkes.</i>

1201
01:04:20,084 --> 01:04:22,324
<i>So, we have Ford running one,
two, three. How about that?</i>

1202
01:04:22,386 --> 01:04:24,488
Too soon. Surely too soon.

1203
01:04:26,858 --> 01:04:28,860
<i>One has
to really be respectful</i>

1204
01:04:28,961 --> 01:04:30,261
<i>of the mechanism with any...</i>

1205
01:04:42,406 --> 01:04:43,785
<i>Here's the big story,</i>

1206
01:04:43,809 --> 01:04:46,344
<i>the lead Ford, driven
by Richie Ginther, retired</i>

1207
01:04:46,444 --> 01:04:48,479
<i>with gearbox trouble,
and the new leader...</i>

1208
01:04:48,579 --> 01:04:52,350
Gearbox. I told them.
Be gentle with it.

1209
01:04:52,450 --> 01:04:54,127
<i>...and his
partner Lorenzo Bandini...</i>

1210
01:04:54,151 --> 01:04:55,295
<i>...who was one of</i>

1211
01:04:55,319 --> 01:04:57,321
<i>the winning drivers last year.</i>

1212
01:04:58,757 --> 01:05:00,324
Who's there?

1213
01:05:01,592 --> 01:05:02,872
<i>Again, we're back,</i>

1214
01:05:02,928 --> 01:05:05,463
<i>speaking to you live
from Le Mans, France.</i>

1215
01:05:05,563 --> 01:05:08,165
<i>The 24 Hours of Le Mans,
the Grand Prix of Endurance,</i>

1216
01:05:08,265 --> 01:05:09,868
<i>the 33rd renewal.</i>

1217
01:05:10,936 --> 01:05:12,603
What's that
you're listening to?

1218
01:05:13,204 --> 01:05:15,439
Oh, some race over in France.

1219
01:05:18,744 --> 01:05:19,811
Exciting?

1220
01:05:20,411 --> 01:05:22,513
I'm not really paying
much attention.

1221
01:05:22,613 --> 01:05:25,182
<i>However, Phil,
there was one time in 1933,</i>

1222
01:05:25,282 --> 01:05:28,219
<i>when the lead changed hands
three times.</i>

1237
01:06:50,701 --> 01:06:53,471
There's a difference
between Ford and Ferrari...

1238
01:07:02,279 --> 01:07:03,414
Grace.

1239
01:07:11,455 --> 01:07:14,793
Yes, sir.
I will send him right in.

1240
01:07:15,794 --> 01:07:16,962
Thank you.

1241
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:21,800
Mr. Shelby,
Mr. Ford will see you now.

1242
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:24,136
- All right.
- Are you still willing

1243
01:07:24,236 --> 01:07:26,437
to stake your reputation
on this guy?

1244
01:07:28,272 --> 01:07:29,808
This way,
Mr. Shelby.

1245
01:07:39,918 --> 01:07:41,285
Mr. Ford.

1246
01:07:41,787 --> 01:07:42,954
Gentlemen.

1247
01:07:43,054 --> 01:07:44,522
Shelby.

1248
01:07:56,902 --> 01:08:00,005
Give me one reason
why I don't fire everyone

1249
01:08:00,105 --> 01:08:01,940
associated with
this abomination

1250
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:03,440
starting with you.

1251
01:08:09,981 --> 01:08:11,315
Well, sir...

1252
01:08:12,349 --> 01:08:13,869
I was thinking
about that very question

1253
01:08:13,952 --> 01:08:17,055
as I sat out there
in your lovely waiting room.

1254
01:08:18,957 --> 01:08:20,225
As I was sitting there...

1255
01:08:20,759 --> 01:08:23,561
I watched that little
red folder right there...

1256
01:08:24,328 --> 01:08:26,097
go through four pairs
of hands...

1257
01:08:27,431 --> 01:08:28,834
before it got to you.

1258
01:08:29,533 --> 01:08:30,836
'Course that doesn't include...

1259
01:08:31,736 --> 01:08:33,839
the 22 or so
other Ford employees

1260
01:08:33,939 --> 01:08:35,459
who probably poked at it
before it made

1261
01:08:35,539 --> 01:08:37,441
its way up to the 19th floor.

1262
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:40,678
All due respect, sir,

1263
01:08:41,579 --> 01:08:43,647
you can't win a race
by committee.

1264
01:08:45,083 --> 01:08:46,852
You need one man in charge.

1265
01:08:47,551 --> 01:08:49,921
Now, the good news,
as I see it,

1266
01:08:50,288 --> 01:08:52,057
is that even with
all the extra weight...

1267
01:08:54,326 --> 01:08:56,328
we still managed
to put old Mr. Ferrari

1268
01:08:56,427 --> 01:08:57,863
exactly where we want him.

1269
01:08:59,164 --> 01:09:00,464
Did we?

1270
01:09:00,899 --> 01:09:02,000
Oh, yes.

1271
01:09:03,869 --> 01:09:05,103
Expand.

1272
01:09:06,403 --> 01:09:07,671
Well...

1273
01:09:09,274 --> 01:09:10,641
sure, we hadn't...

1274
01:09:11,408 --> 01:09:13,677
We haven't worked out
how to corner yet.

1275
01:09:14,511 --> 01:09:15,713
Or stay cool.

1276
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:18,850
Or stay on the ground.

1277
01:09:19,450 --> 01:09:20,952
And a lot of stuff broke.

1278
01:09:21,685 --> 01:09:24,388
In fact, the only thing that
didn't break was the brakes.

1279
01:09:24,956 --> 01:09:26,791
Hell, right now,
we don't even know

1280
01:09:26,892 --> 01:09:29,761
if our paint job will last
the whole 24 hours.

1281
01:09:35,633 --> 01:09:37,068
But our last lap...

1282
01:09:37,601 --> 01:09:41,339
we clocked 218 miles an hour
down the Mulsanne Straight.

1283
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:45,277
Now, in all his years
of racing...

1284
01:09:46,011 --> 01:09:49,713
old Enzo ain't never seen
anything move that fast.

1285
01:09:50,949 --> 01:09:52,083
And now he knows...

1286
01:09:52,650 --> 01:09:54,052
without a doubt...

1287
01:09:55,653 --> 01:09:57,688
we're faster than he is...

1288
01:10:00,859 --> 01:10:02,894
even with the wrong driver...

1289
01:10:04,062 --> 01:10:05,562
and all the committees.

1290
01:10:07,299 --> 01:10:08,699
And that's what
he's thinking about

1291
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,202
while he's sitting
in Modena, Italy...

1292
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:13,738
right now.

1293
01:10:15,173 --> 01:10:16,875
That man is scared to death...

1294
01:10:18,009 --> 01:10:20,912
that this year you actually
might be smart enough

1295
01:10:21,012 --> 01:10:22,479
to start trusting me.

1296
01:10:25,449 --> 01:10:26,851
So, yeah...

1297
01:10:28,619 --> 01:10:31,522
I'd say you got Ferrari
exactly where you want him.

1298
01:10:35,226 --> 01:10:36,560
You're welcome.

1299
01:10:54,245 --> 01:10:55,713
Come here.

1300
01:11:03,288 --> 01:11:05,090
See that little building
down there?

1301
01:11:05,723 --> 01:11:07,092
In World War II...

1302
01:11:07,591 --> 01:11:11,730
three out of five US bombers
rolled off that line.

1303
01:11:13,898 --> 01:11:16,001
You think
Roosevelt beat Hitler?

1304
01:11:17,634 --> 01:11:18,634
Think again.

1305
01:11:18,669 --> 01:11:19,771
This isn't the first time

1306
01:11:19,871 --> 01:11:22,107
Ford Motor's gone
to war in Europe.

1307
01:11:24,541 --> 01:11:27,078
We know how to do more
than push paper.

1308
01:11:29,546 --> 01:11:32,017
And there is one man
running this company.

1309
01:11:34,452 --> 01:11:35,887
You report to him.

1310
01:11:37,288 --> 01:11:38,722
You understand me?

1311
01:11:39,224 --> 01:11:40,624
Yes, sir.

1312
01:11:41,525 --> 01:11:44,062
Go ahead, Carroll.
Go to war.

1313
01:11:47,132 --> 01:11:48,199
Thank you, sir.

1314
01:12:21,132 --> 01:12:22,167
You were right.

1315
01:12:22,734 --> 01:12:24,102
It's the gearbox.

1316
01:12:24,769 --> 01:12:26,104
We ran too hot.

1317
01:12:27,372 --> 01:12:28,740
Three out of four
of 'em broke.

1318
01:12:29,541 --> 01:12:31,042
The rod blew on the other one.

1319
01:12:36,181 --> 01:12:37,849
We're going back, Ken.

1320
01:12:41,386 --> 01:12:44,923
They told me I had
"carte blanche" this time.

1321
01:12:46,324 --> 01:12:48,760
I looked it up.
It's French for "horseshit."

1322
01:12:49,227 --> 01:12:51,563
I know they're gonna squeeze
our nuts any way they can

1323
01:12:51,662 --> 01:12:53,064
soon as they work out how.

1324
01:12:53,597 --> 01:12:55,033
Well, the, uh...

1325
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:57,268
ice cream's melting.

1326
01:13:00,305 --> 01:13:01,873
All right. Hey, Ken.

1327
01:13:03,408 --> 01:13:05,009
You want me to apologize?

1328
01:13:06,511 --> 01:13:07,779
Mmm.

1329
01:13:08,179 --> 01:13:09,214
You want me to beg?

1330
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:11,416
I don't know.
Let's try it out.

1331
01:13:11,516 --> 01:13:13,885
Let's, uh, see how that feels.

1332
01:13:20,125 --> 01:13:21,259
Ken, I'm sorry.

1333
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:23,995
Sincerely.

1334
01:13:25,530 --> 01:13:26,865
Mmm.

1335
01:13:27,866 --> 01:13:30,401
Do you have any idea the kind
of shit that I had to eat

1336
01:13:30,502 --> 01:13:32,070
just to get four wheels
on that grid?

1337
01:13:32,170 --> 01:13:33,171
No, you don't.

1338
01:13:33,271 --> 01:13:35,015
'Cause you don't deal
with any of that stuff.

1339
01:13:35,039 --> 01:13:36,908
Now knock it off, Ken.
We got work to do,

1340
01:13:37,008 --> 01:13:38,488
and this car ain't gonna
build itself.

1341
01:13:47,684 --> 01:13:50,721
Okay. All right.

1342
01:13:59,464 --> 01:14:02,000
God.

1343
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:03,768
Come here.

1344
01:14:04,736 --> 01:14:07,005
- Bloody car salesman.
- Shit!

1345
01:14:09,941 --> 01:14:11,708
Come on.
Now you're gonna get it.

1346
01:14:16,347 --> 01:14:17,448
Get off me!

1347
01:14:19,918 --> 01:14:23,421
Stubborn son of a bitch.

1348
01:14:23,521 --> 01:14:24,923
God!

1349
01:14:27,091 --> 01:14:28,726
- You just look...
- Right.

1350
01:14:29,561 --> 01:14:30,862
- Yeah, now.
- You...

1351
01:14:30,962 --> 01:14:32,530
- Ow!
- You all right?

1352
01:14:32,630 --> 01:14:34,065
Shit!

1353
01:14:35,533 --> 01:14:37,101
Now you're gonna get it.

1354
01:14:38,702 --> 01:14:40,538
Come here.

1355
01:14:43,174 --> 01:14:44,209
Done.

1356
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:50,481
Mollie, darling.

1357
01:14:51,282 --> 01:14:52,350
Yes, love?

1358
01:14:52,716 --> 01:14:54,285
Can I get a fizzy pop, please?

1359
01:14:55,587 --> 01:14:56,854
Yes, love.

1360
01:14:58,489 --> 01:14:59,791
You want one, too, Shelby?

1361
01:15:00,158 --> 01:15:02,260
- No. No.
- Uh, yes, please, Mollie.

1362
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:04,229
No. He can get his own.

1363
01:15:04,596 --> 01:15:06,030
Just for me, please.

1364
01:15:12,770 --> 01:15:14,138
How long has that been?

1365
01:15:15,073 --> 01:15:17,141
Oh, it's gotta be three
or four years, at least.

1366
01:15:17,242 --> 01:15:19,210
Right. Riverside.

1367
01:15:19,310 --> 01:15:22,280
Yeah.
SCCA Divisional Championship.

1368
01:15:22,747 --> 01:15:24,115
You broke my finger.

1369
01:15:25,950 --> 01:15:29,854
What's that nippy bloody thing

1370
01:15:30,188 --> 01:15:31,723
you do under the arm,
that thing?

1371
01:15:31,823 --> 01:15:33,524
Yeah. I call that
the Llama Bite.

1372
01:15:33,625 --> 01:15:36,094
You name it?

1373
01:15:36,194 --> 01:15:38,463
Where'd you learn that?
The Girl Scouts?

1374
01:15:38,563 --> 01:15:41,065
- What? You wanna go again?
- Here you go.

1375
01:15:42,333 --> 01:15:43,401
You're an angel.

1376
01:15:43,501 --> 01:15:44,535
Thank you.

1377
01:15:44,636 --> 01:15:45,770
My pleasure.

1378
01:15:46,571 --> 01:15:49,107
Right. Well, I'm about to go
to the grocery store.

1379
01:15:49,207 --> 01:15:51,075
Anything you think
you'll need?

1380
01:15:51,643 --> 01:15:53,811
Um, ice cream.

1381
01:15:54,679 --> 01:15:56,481
Ice cream would be good
and, uh...

1382
01:15:57,348 --> 01:15:58,416
bread.

1383
01:15:59,617 --> 01:16:00,718
Right.

1384
01:16:00,852 --> 01:16:02,453
No, I'm good.
Thank you.

1385
01:16:03,154 --> 01:16:05,223
Thanks, Moll.

1386
01:16:05,323 --> 01:16:06,958
You still take those
for your ticker?

1387
01:16:07,392 --> 01:16:09,560
Only 'cause
they're so delicious.

1388
01:16:09,661 --> 01:16:12,797
- Up yours.
- Oh, go to hell.

1389
01:16:20,438 --> 01:16:22,607
Come on.
Giddy-up. Giddy-up. Giddy-up.

1390
01:16:38,423 --> 01:16:41,225
Phil! Here's the one
for you, mate.

1391
01:16:41,326 --> 01:16:42,593
Dino, come here.

1392
01:17:00,878 --> 01:17:02,046
Well?

1393
01:17:02,146 --> 01:17:03,715
There's still lag
when I hit the gas.

1394
01:17:03,816 --> 01:17:05,259
Let's get rid of
the vacuum secondaries.

1395
01:17:05,283 --> 01:17:06,752
Charlie, get a Holley carb.

1396
01:17:06,851 --> 01:17:08,653
We're gonna rebuild
the throttle assembly.

1397
01:17:08,754 --> 01:17:10,154
Three weeks to Daytona,

1398
01:17:10,188 --> 01:17:13,057
and it still feels
like a bag of squirrels.

1399
01:17:13,157 --> 01:17:14,425
Brake heat.

1400
01:17:14,859 --> 01:17:16,494
That's a whole different
ball game.

1401
01:17:16,594 --> 01:17:19,197
All right, Petey,
let's go for that ride.

1402
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,173
What are you doing?

1403
01:17:30,708 --> 01:17:32,043
You see that crack?

1404
01:17:32,143 --> 01:17:34,011
That's my marker
for turn eight.

1405
01:17:36,881 --> 01:17:38,349
What, to slow down?

1406
01:17:39,183 --> 01:17:42,387
Uh, brush the brakes
and downshift.

1407
01:17:44,288 --> 01:17:46,924
But you'll be going
150 miles an hour.

1408
01:17:47,658 --> 01:17:48,794
Yeah.

1409
01:17:48,893 --> 01:17:50,428
So how do you see it?

1410
01:17:50,528 --> 01:17:53,564
You're going fast,
but as the car speeds up...

1411
01:17:54,098 --> 01:17:56,467
everything else slows down.

1412
01:17:56,567 --> 01:17:58,236
You don't do that.

1413
01:17:59,036 --> 01:18:00,938
You do this. Right?

1414
01:18:01,038 --> 01:18:03,040
And then you see everything.

1415
01:18:05,676 --> 01:18:07,478
Do you set other markers?

1416
01:18:07,578 --> 01:18:09,914
Indeed I do.

1417
01:18:11,416 --> 01:18:12,583
Lots of them.

1418
01:18:14,452 --> 01:18:16,789
Yeah, 'cause
you can't just push

1419
01:18:16,889 --> 01:18:18,857
the car hard
the whole way, right?

1420
01:18:18,956 --> 01:18:21,492
That's right. You have
to be kind to the car.

1421
01:18:21,592 --> 01:18:25,963
You feel the poor thing
groaning underneath you.

1422
01:18:26,732 --> 01:18:30,803
If you're gonna push a piece
of machinery to the limit

1423
01:18:30,903 --> 01:18:32,470
and expect it
to hold together,

1424
01:18:32,570 --> 01:18:37,141
you have to have some sense
of where that limit is.

1425
01:18:39,845 --> 01:18:41,078
Look out there.

1426
01:18:41,979 --> 01:18:45,149
Out there is the perfect lap.

1427
01:18:47,385 --> 01:18:48,553
No mistakes.

1428
01:18:49,187 --> 01:18:51,556
Every gear change,
every corner...

1429
01:18:53,324 --> 01:18:54,392
perfect.

1430
01:18:55,894 --> 01:18:57,261
You see it?

1431
01:19:01,399 --> 01:19:02,567
I think so.

1432
01:19:04,569 --> 01:19:06,137
Most people can't.

1433
01:19:07,271 --> 01:19:10,241
Most people don't even know
it's out there, but it is.

1434
01:19:12,510 --> 01:19:13,678
It's there.

1435
01:19:16,714 --> 01:19:18,182
You want some ice cream?

1436
01:19:20,718 --> 01:19:22,153
- Yeah.
- All right.

1437
01:19:22,987 --> 01:19:24,255
Come on, then.

1438
01:19:24,790 --> 01:19:26,157
Do you know
what this marker is?

1439
01:19:26,257 --> 01:19:27,367
- What?
- That one.

1440
01:19:27,391 --> 01:19:28,861
Pull my finger.
You'll find out.

1441
01:19:51,048 --> 01:19:53,084
How much longer
before he comes in?

1442
01:19:53,184 --> 01:19:55,553
Uh, well, we change drivers
every four hours,

1443
01:19:55,653 --> 01:19:57,431
- so about 10 minutes.
<i>- No, hang on.</i>

1444
01:19:57,455 --> 01:20:00,057
You're saying Beebe
is 100 percent in charge now?

1445
01:20:00,157 --> 01:20:02,293
<i>Yes,
and he wants Miles gone.</i>

1446
01:20:02,895 --> 01:20:04,595
Look, it's personal
with this guy.

1447
01:20:04,695 --> 01:20:06,664
And, yes, he has the leverage
to stick it to you.

1448
01:20:06,765 --> 01:20:08,666
<i>He and the Deuce
are flying there tomorrow.</i>

1449
01:20:08,767 --> 01:20:09,878
He's gonna tell you in person.

1450
01:20:09,902 --> 01:20:11,068
Now, all he is hoping for

1451
01:20:11,168 --> 01:20:12,771
- is that you lose your cool.
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>

1452
01:20:12,871 --> 01:20:14,338
<i>It's time to let this go.</i>

1453
01:20:14,438 --> 01:20:15,841
You cannot destroy
the whole thing.

1454
01:20:15,941 --> 01:20:16,975
Not for one goddamn guy.

1455
01:20:17,074 --> 01:20:19,011
- Sure, I can.
- <i>Well, why?</i>

1456
01:20:19,110 --> 01:20:20,320
'Cause while
we're here talking,

1457
01:20:20,344 --> 01:20:21,679
he's out there
getting it done.

1458
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:31,222
Oh, shit!

1459
01:20:32,858 --> 01:20:34,458
He's got brake fade.

1460
01:20:41,833 --> 01:20:43,067
Ease off!

1461
01:20:53,177 --> 01:20:54,178
<i>Carroll?</i>

1462
01:20:54,445 --> 01:20:55,757
- Get him out!
- Peter!

1463
01:20:55,781 --> 01:20:57,582
Go on. Go inside.

1464
01:20:57,682 --> 01:20:58,581
Just stay there.

1465
01:20:58,583 --> 01:21:00,052
- Get Ken!
- Ken!

1466
01:21:00,151 --> 01:21:01,552
Get him out!

1467
01:21:03,254 --> 01:21:04,422
There he is!

1468
01:21:04,522 --> 01:21:05,354
Ken!

1469
01:21:05,356 --> 01:21:06,724
I can see him.

1470
01:21:13,097 --> 01:21:14,498
- Ken!
- Come on.

1471
01:21:21,105 --> 01:21:22,406
The brakes.

1472
01:21:31,716 --> 01:21:34,619
Let's just rip out
the damn engine. All right?

1473
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:37,421
We can't use it
if we can't stop.

1474
01:21:37,521 --> 01:21:38,933
You know,
the brakes would last longer

1475
01:21:38,957 --> 01:21:40,591
if we slowed down a bit.

1476
01:21:40,859 --> 01:21:43,527
Wouldn't that defeat the whole
purpose of the extra power?

1477
01:21:44,195 --> 01:21:45,372
You know,
I thought the whole point

1478
01:21:45,396 --> 01:21:46,765
was to win the damned race.

1479
01:21:47,498 --> 01:21:49,533
Maybe we could design
a new assembly.

1480
01:21:49,634 --> 01:21:53,337
Instead of swapping out
the pads in the pits...

1481
01:21:53,739 --> 01:21:56,574
swap out
the entire braking system.

1482
01:21:56,674 --> 01:21:58,209
Rotors included.

1483
01:21:58,777 --> 01:21:59,911
Put in a fresh one.

1484
01:22:00,012 --> 01:22:01,780
Wait, wait, wait, Pops,

1485
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:02,981
are we allowed to do that?

1486
01:22:03,081 --> 01:22:06,283
I don't know.
I don't read French.

1487
01:22:07,819 --> 01:22:12,758
Well, brakes are "a part"
like any other, right?

1488
01:22:12,858 --> 01:22:15,192
We are allowed
to change parts.

1489
01:22:15,292 --> 01:22:17,161
Yes.
Will we have time to do that?

1490
01:22:17,261 --> 01:22:18,864
I don't know yet,
Charlie.

1491
01:22:19,463 --> 01:22:21,066
I'm gonna take him home.

1492
01:22:21,165 --> 01:22:22,266
All right.

1493
01:22:22,366 --> 01:22:23,601
Sort this shit out.

1494
01:22:23,701 --> 01:22:24,770
I will.

1495
01:22:34,211 --> 01:22:36,614
Have you ever been on fire?

1496
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:42,520
Uh, well, no,
it's never happened to me.

1497
01:22:47,391 --> 01:22:49,861
But the suit's
flameproof, see?

1498
01:22:49,961 --> 01:22:51,529
It, uh, keeps heat out.

1499
01:22:52,496 --> 01:22:53,531
Yeah.

1500
01:22:55,133 --> 01:22:57,501
But Lewis-Evans
burned to death

1501
01:22:57,601 --> 01:22:58,837
in the Moroccan Grand Prix.

1502
01:22:58,937 --> 01:23:00,939
He had a flameproof suit on.

1503
01:23:02,174 --> 01:23:05,209
Mm-hmm. Yeah, but, um...

1504
01:23:08,013 --> 01:23:09,313
See, he got stuck.

1505
01:23:09,413 --> 01:23:10,882
He couldn't breathe.

1506
01:23:11,950 --> 01:23:15,553
So, as long as you get out
of the car, you're okay.

1507
01:23:19,724 --> 01:23:21,325
Dad got out.

1508
01:23:22,426 --> 01:23:24,261
- He sure did.
- Peter!

1509
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:29,400
Bye.

1510
01:23:30,234 --> 01:23:31,569
See ya.

1511
01:23:34,172 --> 01:23:35,774
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1512
01:23:36,975 --> 01:23:38,309
What's wrong with you?

1513
01:23:39,177 --> 01:23:40,411
And don't be telling me brakes

1514
01:23:40,511 --> 01:23:42,748
or me almost kicking
the bucket out there.

1515
01:23:42,848 --> 01:23:45,382
It's something to do
with the suits, isn't it?

1516
01:23:47,786 --> 01:23:49,154
It's under control.

1517
01:23:49,253 --> 01:23:50,588
What is it?

1518
01:23:50,688 --> 01:23:52,299
You know how we talked about
how you do your thing,

1519
01:23:52,323 --> 01:23:53,390
I do my thing?

1520
01:23:53,491 --> 01:23:54,931
- This is my thing.
- Really, Shel...

1521
01:23:54,993 --> 01:23:56,460
Just trust me, Ken.

1522
01:23:57,129 --> 01:23:58,496
You got a plan?

1523
01:23:59,197 --> 01:24:00,498
Absolutely.

1524
01:24:00,999 --> 01:24:02,033
It a good one?

1525
01:24:03,001 --> 01:24:04,268
It's high risk.

1526
01:24:04,368 --> 01:24:05,402
How high risk?

1527
01:24:05,503 --> 01:24:07,005
Extremely high risk.

1528
01:24:08,940 --> 01:24:10,374
Well, that's something.

1529
01:24:11,109 --> 01:24:13,011
- Glad we had this talk.
- Anytime.

1530
01:24:25,257 --> 01:24:27,726
Mr. Ford, this is a surprise.

1531
01:24:28,526 --> 01:24:30,796
Apologies for the unannounced
intrusion, Mr. Shelby,

1532
01:24:30,896 --> 01:24:34,298
but when a man pays $9 million
for an automobile,

1533
01:24:34,398 --> 01:24:36,234
he ought to at least
be able to see it.

1534
01:24:36,333 --> 01:24:37,903
Well, that sounds
reasonable enough.

1535
01:24:38,003 --> 01:24:39,838
Uh, Shelby, could I have a word?

1536
01:24:39,938 --> 01:24:41,106
Sure.

1537
01:24:41,206 --> 01:24:43,008
- In private?
- Uh, yeah.

1538
01:24:43,108 --> 01:24:44,508
That would be preferable.

1539
01:24:44,608 --> 01:24:45,768
All right.
Hey, Phil.

1540
01:24:45,844 --> 01:24:47,478
You wanna take care
of Mr. Ford here?

1541
01:24:47,578 --> 01:24:49,247
Mr. Ford,
that's Phil Remington.

1542
01:24:49,346 --> 01:24:50,414
Of course.

1543
01:24:50,514 --> 01:24:51,658
Come up
to my office, Leo.

1544
01:24:51,682 --> 01:24:52,827
- Pleasure to meet you, sir.
- Phil.

1545
01:24:52,851 --> 01:24:54,953
Give you a little tour
of your car.

1546
01:24:55,787 --> 01:24:58,857
We, uh, took out
your 289 small block...

1547
01:24:59,423 --> 01:25:01,893
and put in a 4277-liter.

1548
01:25:04,528 --> 01:25:06,832
Uh, firstly,
I want to just clear the air.

1549
01:25:06,932 --> 01:25:09,301
I hope
that whatever disagreements

1550
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:11,303
between us
can just be chalked up...

1551
01:25:11,870 --> 01:25:14,538
to natural red-bloodedness
in the heat of battle.

1552
01:25:14,638 --> 01:25:17,575
Oh, I appreciate that, Leo.
Truly, I do.

1553
01:25:18,944 --> 01:25:21,947
It falls on me, Shelby,
to inform you

1554
01:25:22,047 --> 01:25:23,547
that I have been appointed

1555
01:25:23,647 --> 01:25:26,684
overall executive director
of the racing program.

1556
01:25:27,919 --> 01:25:31,756
Now, I do hope that this
won't be a problem between us.

1557
01:25:32,556 --> 01:25:34,826
Well, I assure you, Leo,
it will not.

1558
01:25:45,103 --> 01:25:46,403
Hey, Carroll...

1559
01:25:46,872 --> 01:25:47,738
Carroll!

1560
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:49,074
And what is that top speed

1561
01:25:49,174 --> 01:25:50,308
with the, uh, 427?

1562
01:25:50,407 --> 01:25:52,177
Well, why don't we take it
for a spin?

1563
01:25:52,277 --> 01:25:53,644
- What?
- Yeah, go on, Mr. Ford.

1564
01:25:53,745 --> 01:25:56,014
- Hop on in. Go on.
- You want me to...

1565
01:25:56,114 --> 01:25:58,316
Just see
what $9 million feels like.

1566
01:25:58,415 --> 01:26:00,852
Hey!

1567
01:26:00,952 --> 01:26:02,153
God...

1568
01:26:05,857 --> 01:26:06,892
Open the door!

1569
01:26:06,992 --> 01:26:08,659
Hey, open the door!

1570
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:10,962
Open the door!

1571
01:26:13,164 --> 01:26:14,431
Just hold me right there,

1572
01:26:14,531 --> 01:26:16,034
and you take my hand.

1573
01:26:17,668 --> 01:26:20,338
Oh, God. I sat on my nuts.

1574
01:26:20,437 --> 01:26:22,797
We're gonna build the next one
for comfort. Don't you worry.

1575
01:26:31,383 --> 01:26:32,716
Open the door.

1576
01:26:32,817 --> 01:26:34,328
Sorry, sir,
if you just give me a moment.

1577
01:26:34,352 --> 01:26:35,495
- Open the door.
- It's a sticky one.

1578
01:26:35,519 --> 01:26:37,055
You ready?

1579
01:26:37,155 --> 01:26:38,900
The name on the middle
of that steering wheel

1580
01:26:38,924 --> 01:26:41,359
should tell you that I was
born ready, Shelby. Hit it.

1581
01:26:41,458 --> 01:26:43,527
Attaboy.

1582
01:26:45,663 --> 01:26:48,532
Whoa! It's got a little kick,
doesn't it?

1583
01:26:48,833 --> 01:26:50,735
- Open this door.
- Oh, there we go.

1584
01:26:50,835 --> 01:26:53,104
Good God, Mr. Beebe.
You okay, sir?

1585
01:26:54,940 --> 01:26:57,541
Whoa! Oh, my God!

1586
01:26:58,509 --> 01:27:01,212
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1587
01:27:05,016 --> 01:27:06,384
Yeah, baby.

1588
01:27:06,483 --> 01:27:09,154
Yeah, baby.

1589
01:27:12,057 --> 01:27:14,225
It's about right now
the uninitiated

1590
01:27:14,326 --> 01:27:16,527
have a tendency
to soil themselves.

1591
01:27:23,534 --> 01:27:26,271
Oh, my God! Whoa!

1592
01:28:02,907 --> 01:28:04,042
Mr. Ford...

1593
01:28:07,979 --> 01:28:09,314
You okay?

1594
01:28:12,649 --> 01:28:13,918
Mr. Ford...

1595
01:28:14,486 --> 01:28:15,586
you all right?

1596
01:28:15,686 --> 01:28:17,088
I had no idea.

1597
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:21,092
I had no idea.

1598
01:28:24,062 --> 01:28:25,397
I wish my daddy...

1599
01:28:25,764 --> 01:28:27,465
he were alive to see this.

1600
01:28:27,732 --> 01:28:30,601
To feel this.

1601
01:28:32,103 --> 01:28:34,205
Now, this is not a machine
just anybody can get in

1602
01:28:34,305 --> 01:28:35,440
and easily control.

1603
01:28:35,539 --> 01:28:36,975
Absolutely not.

1604
01:28:37,608 --> 01:28:38,642
I had no idea.

1605
01:28:38,743 --> 01:28:40,178
Now, you wanna win Le Mans.

1606
01:28:40,912 --> 01:28:42,414
If you really wanna take
first place,

1607
01:28:42,514 --> 01:28:44,082
Ken Miles is the man to do it.

1608
01:28:53,258 --> 01:28:54,492
Good timing.

1609
01:28:54,591 --> 01:28:55,703
<i>Now, he knows this car</i>

1610
01:28:55,727 --> 01:28:57,328
because he helped me build it.

1611
01:28:58,730 --> 01:29:01,099
Shelby, you know I've already

1612
01:29:01,199 --> 01:29:02,967
appointed Leo Beebe
director of racing.

1613
01:29:03,068 --> 01:29:05,170
Which is exactly
why I'm talking to you.

1614
01:29:06,071 --> 01:29:08,973
Now, you let Ken Miles
race Daytona.

1615
01:29:09,573 --> 01:29:11,042
If he wins...

1616
01:29:11,843 --> 01:29:13,745
he gets to drive Le Mans.

1617
01:29:16,247 --> 01:29:17,449
And if he doesn't?

1618
01:29:18,216 --> 01:29:20,552
Ford Motor Company
gets full ownership

1619
01:29:20,651 --> 01:29:22,053
of Shelby American.

1620
01:29:22,153 --> 01:29:23,488
Lock, stock, and brand.

1621
01:29:23,587 --> 01:29:24,856
Forever.

1622
01:29:27,926 --> 01:29:30,694
<i>We're in
hour six at the Daytona 24,</i>

1623
01:29:30,795 --> 01:29:33,965
<i>and Fords are dominating
the leaderboard.</i>

1624
01:29:34,065 --> 01:29:37,102
<i>Shelby American's Ken Miles
holds a narrow lead</i>

1625
01:29:37,202 --> 01:29:40,271
<i>over the Holman-Moody Ford
driven by Walt Hansgen.</i>

1626
01:29:41,339 --> 01:29:43,707
I don't bloody think so, Walt.

1627
01:30:01,993 --> 01:30:05,196
Oh, this race is not just
a test of our cars,

1628
01:30:05,296 --> 01:30:06,630
but also our teams.

1629
01:30:06,731 --> 01:30:08,731
As you know, we have
a second team out there today.

1630
01:30:08,766 --> 01:30:10,935
- Holman-Moody.
- That's right.

1631
01:30:11,035 --> 01:30:12,604
<i>Number 95, Hansgen,</i>

1632
01:30:12,703 --> 01:30:14,048
<i>blisters through
the front tri-oval</i>

1633
01:30:14,072 --> 01:30:16,241
<i>while closing in on Ken Miles.</i>

1634
01:30:16,341 --> 01:30:17,641
Walt's pushing her too fast.

1635
01:30:17,742 --> 01:30:19,944
He's pushing 7,000 RPM.

1636
01:30:20,044 --> 01:30:21,546
Hey, get the EZ sign
out there.

1637
01:30:21,645 --> 01:30:23,214
Come on. Move. Do it now.

1638
01:30:23,314 --> 01:30:25,383
Every one of these GTs
out there today

1639
01:30:25,483 --> 01:30:27,085
is under
my direct supervision.

1640
01:30:27,185 --> 01:30:30,188
And of course the supervision
of Henry Ford II.

1641
01:30:30,288 --> 01:30:33,358
The drivers,
the speed, the strategy...

1642
01:30:33,791 --> 01:30:36,628
even the RPMs
are determined by us.

1643
01:30:40,331 --> 01:30:42,042
<i>Ken Miles
is locked in a pitched battle</i>

1644
01:30:42,066 --> 01:30:45,203
<i>with Hansgen
as they pass the grandstand.</i>

1645
01:30:48,206 --> 01:30:51,242
<i>Hansgen is taking a run
at Miles entering turn one.</i>

1646
01:30:51,342 --> 01:30:52,544
<i>Miles is boxed in.</i>

1647
01:30:52,644 --> 01:30:54,946
<i>Hansgen slips by
and takes the lead</i>

1648
01:30:55,046 --> 01:30:57,081
<i>approaching
the infield chicane.</i>

1649
01:31:06,791 --> 01:31:07,859
Cor blimey!

1650
01:31:07,959 --> 01:31:09,527
Did you see that?

1651
01:31:09,627 --> 01:31:11,067
<i>The caution flag is out.</i>

1652
01:31:17,302 --> 01:31:19,904
Still racing.
Hey, we are still racing.

1653
01:31:20,004 --> 01:31:21,172
Come on, guys, let's go!

1654
01:31:21,272 --> 01:31:22,272
Let's go. Move it.

1655
01:31:22,340 --> 01:31:23,341
He's coming in.

1656
01:31:24,142 --> 01:31:26,411
Let's go,
let's go, guys. Come on.

1657
01:31:26,511 --> 01:31:27,879
Go, tires up.

1658
01:31:27,979 --> 01:31:29,623
Here, right here.
Let's go. Let's go. Move it.

1659
01:31:29,647 --> 01:31:31,392
- Fuel flying in.
- Breaker bar!

1660
01:31:31,416 --> 01:31:33,218
- We're good.
- It all checked out.

1661
01:31:33,318 --> 01:31:34,852
- 36. 38.
- Go! Go!

1662
01:31:34,953 --> 01:31:37,255
Hansgen is right up our arse.

1663
01:31:37,355 --> 01:31:39,133
If I can just get
outta the pit ahead of him...

1664
01:31:39,157 --> 01:31:41,826
She's running hot,
but I think she'll hold.

1665
01:31:41,926 --> 01:31:43,537
- Fuel's low.
- Bring up the scoop.

1666
01:31:43,561 --> 01:31:44,862
She's hot.

1667
01:31:46,965 --> 01:31:48,833
Hey there, Walt.
Good to see you.

1668
01:31:48,933 --> 01:31:50,635
Yeah, after I get out
of this pit, Shelby,

1669
01:31:50,735 --> 01:31:51,855
it's the last time you will.

1670
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:52,936
Oh, don't worry.

1671
01:31:53,004 --> 01:31:54,339
We got rearview mirrors.

1672
01:31:55,740 --> 01:31:57,508
What happened
to that Mustang he took out?

1673
01:31:58,276 --> 01:31:59,611
Don't know yet.

1674
01:31:59,711 --> 01:32:02,513
I can push her harder
than six, Shel.

1675
01:32:02,614 --> 01:32:05,016
- I can feel it.
- Uh-huh.

1676
01:32:08,386 --> 01:32:12,257
Hey, how come these guys pit
so much faster than we do?

1677
01:32:12,357 --> 01:32:15,960
They got a goddamn
NASCAR crew, that's why.

1678
01:32:16,060 --> 01:32:18,029
- No shit?
- No shit.

1679
01:32:18,496 --> 01:32:20,298
Go! Go, come on.

1680
01:32:21,633 --> 01:32:23,368
We're clear, we're clear.

1681
01:32:23,468 --> 01:32:24,569
Goddamn NASCAR crew.

1682
01:32:24,669 --> 01:32:26,337
Go, go, go!

1683
01:32:26,739 --> 01:32:28,373
Guys, they've already left.

1684
01:32:31,242 --> 01:32:32,208
Hello?

1685
01:32:32,210 --> 01:32:34,345
<i>There's my Mollie. Hello.</i>

1686
01:32:34,879 --> 01:32:35,947
Hiya, love.

1687
01:32:36,047 --> 01:32:37,882
- Mom? Mom?
- <i>What are you doing?</i>

1688
01:32:37,982 --> 01:32:38,983
Just having a cuppa.

1689
01:32:39,083 --> 01:32:40,753
Mom, ask him about the brakes.

1690
01:32:40,852 --> 01:32:43,254
- Go to bed. It's 1:00 a.m.
- Ask him.

1691
01:32:43,354 --> 01:32:44,689
Go to bed. Now.

1692
01:32:44,789 --> 01:32:46,591
I take it he's not asleep.

1693
01:32:46,691 --> 01:32:48,459
I'm sure he smuggled
in a radio.

1694
01:32:48,559 --> 01:32:49,827
<i>Yeah.</i>

1695
01:32:49,927 --> 01:32:51,205
He said to ask,
"How are the brakes?"

1696
01:32:51,229 --> 01:32:53,064
The brakes? Yes. No, no, no.

1697
01:32:53,164 --> 01:32:55,199
Tell him
they're working for now.

1698
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:58,002
<i>You know, Shelby's been acting
very strange.</i>

1699
01:32:58,102 --> 01:32:59,170
- <i>Ford have gone...</i>
- Ken.

1700
01:32:59,270 --> 01:33:00,605
<i>...and put up another team.</i>

1701
01:33:00,705 --> 01:33:01,973
- With a GT.
- <i>Ken.</i>

1702
01:33:02,073 --> 01:33:03,274
Some sort of yampy,

1703
01:33:03,374 --> 01:33:05,310
<i>bloody corporate test
or something.</i>

1704
01:33:05,410 --> 01:33:07,412
Just take a rest
whenever you get a chance.

1705
01:33:07,512 --> 01:33:08,952
<i>Sorry, my love,
what were you saying?</i>

1706
01:33:09,047 --> 01:33:10,548
You've only got a few hours.

1707
01:33:10,648 --> 01:33:11,750
<i>I can't hear you very well.</i>

1708
01:33:11,849 --> 01:33:13,217
<i>I'm sorry. I can't hear you.</i>

1709
01:33:13,318 --> 01:33:14,318
<i>Wish me luck.</i>

1710
01:33:14,352 --> 01:33:16,554
- Good luck.
- <i>I love you, darling.</i>

1711
01:33:16,654 --> 01:33:18,990

this late in the race.

1719
01:33:33,137 --> 01:33:35,673
Engine's hot. We gotta keep it
under six thou.

1720
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:25,156
All right.

1721
01:34:50,181 --> 01:34:51,949
She could come apart.

1722
01:34:52,049 --> 01:34:53,584
One way to find out.

1723
01:34:56,454 --> 01:34:58,990
I thought we were keeping him
under 6,000?

1724
01:34:59,390 --> 01:35:00,925
Shut up, Don.

1725

01:37:44,121 --> 01:37:45,791
And which team was it, Leo?

1755
01:37:47,191 --> 01:37:49,761
Shelby American.
Miles driving.

1756
01:37:51,529 --> 01:37:52,831
Son of a bitch.

1757
01:37:53,598 --> 01:37:55,242
All right.

1758
01:37:55,266 --> 01:37:56,701
Where the hell is he?

1759
01:37:56,802 --> 01:37:58,569
Hang on, I see him. Hey, wait.

1760
01:37:58,669 --> 01:38:00,973
Someone lost a bulldog
on the beach.

1761
01:38:02,741 --> 01:38:04,575
No, no. Come on. Come on.

1762
01:38:05,409 --> 01:38:08,512
Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

1763
01:38:08,613 --> 01:38:11,482
Someone get this man a drink.
Someone get him a drink.

1764
01:38:27,164 --> 01:38:28,366
Oi.

1765
01:38:29,266 --> 01:38:31,535
In bed, you.
What are you doing?

1766
01:38:32,104 --> 01:38:33,604
Dirty stop out.

1767
01:38:34,006 --> 01:38:35,040
I was...

1768
01:38:35,841 --> 01:38:38,744
drawing a map, so I could
follow you on Le Mans.

1769
01:38:39,210 --> 01:38:40,478
Mmm.

1770
01:38:42,513 --> 01:38:44,482
Look at that.

1771
01:38:45,851 --> 01:38:47,385
That is spot on.

1772
01:38:47,485 --> 01:38:49,720
You are a dab hand,
very accurate.

1773
01:38:51,722 --> 01:38:53,091
Tell me about the track.

1774
01:38:53,190 --> 01:38:54,893
No, I can't, Petey.

1775
01:38:54,993 --> 01:38:56,227
Please.

1776
01:39:04,702 --> 01:39:06,872
Well, you start
at the start line.

1777
01:39:07,505 --> 01:39:09,407
Yeah, but you
actually start here

1778
01:39:09,507 --> 01:39:11,676
because you have to run
to your car at Le Mans.

1779
01:39:11,777 --> 01:39:12,878
True enough.

1780
01:39:12,978 --> 01:39:16,514
So, once your old man manages
to hobble over...

1781
01:39:17,082 --> 01:39:19,350
- and pull out...
- And not hit anyone.

1782
01:39:19,450 --> 01:39:21,419
Yes, right.

1783
01:39:22,087 --> 01:39:25,891
Then you accelerate very hard
up to Dunlop Bridge...

1784
01:39:26,858 --> 01:39:28,559
road banking away from ya

1785
01:39:28,659 --> 01:39:31,495
and down through the trees
to the Esses...

1786
01:39:31,595 --> 01:39:33,865
and accelerate up
to Tertre Rouge.

1787
01:39:33,965 --> 01:39:36,233
Critical first gear corner.

1788
01:39:36,735 --> 01:39:37,936
Fast entry.

1789
01:39:38,302 --> 01:39:40,972
Keep your speed up
for your exit onto...

1790
01:39:42,074 --> 01:39:43,240
Mulsanne.

1791
01:39:43,708 --> 01:39:46,477
Long straightaway,
hemmed in by poplars.

1792
01:39:46,577 --> 01:39:49,881
Top gear, 210 miles per hour.

1793
01:39:50,214 --> 01:39:52,283
And down to third, revs up.

1794
01:39:52,383 --> 01:39:53,919
Revs are your friend.

1795
01:39:54,618 --> 01:39:58,190
Get a maximum exit.
Let the car run free.

1796
01:39:58,289 --> 01:40:00,192
Over the brow...

1797
01:40:00,291 --> 01:40:01,592
then wham!

1798
01:40:03,095 --> 01:40:04,328
Mulsanne Corner.

1799
01:40:04,428 --> 01:40:07,099
Accelerate to Arnage

1800
01:40:07,199 --> 01:40:08,839
and then over the rise
to the White House.

1801
01:40:08,867 --> 01:40:10,736
You get that right and...

1802
01:40:13,872 --> 01:40:16,373
your first three
and a half minutes...

1803
01:40:17,241 --> 01:40:18,810
of 24 hours.

1804
01:40:19,811 --> 01:40:26,617
But... you can't make
every lap perfect.

1805
01:40:27,451 --> 01:40:29,020
But I can try.

1806
01:40:34,860 --> 01:40:36,360
All right.

1807
01:40:37,162 --> 01:40:38,662
Off to bed, you.

1808
01:40:41,233 --> 01:40:44,035
I will... wake you...

1809
01:40:45,103 --> 01:40:46,570
before I leave for France.

1810
01:40:47,205 --> 01:40:48,439
I promise.

1811
01:40:48,807 --> 01:40:50,976
Okay. Good night.

1812
01:41:18,870 --> 01:41:20,205
Eh, where's, um...

1813
01:41:20,872 --> 01:41:23,842
Where's that?
The Hotel Saint Pierre?

1814
01:41:25,210 --> 01:41:26,677
Where?

1815
01:42:12,723 --> 01:42:14,793
It's gonna
rain again tomorrow.

1816
01:42:20,098 --> 01:42:21,766
There's always rain here.

1817
01:42:25,103 --> 01:42:26,537
Start'll be dry though,

1818
01:42:26,637 --> 01:42:30,008
so we'll swap out
your tires come rain.

1819
01:42:32,710 --> 01:42:34,079
Yeah.

1820
01:42:36,380 --> 01:42:40,819
Might be smart
to sleep, Bulldog.

1821
01:42:42,821 --> 01:42:44,455
Well, you, too.

1822
01:42:45,056 --> 01:42:46,191
I'm not driving.

1823
01:42:49,060 --> 01:42:52,197
That's a bloody shame, that.

1824
01:42:52,463 --> 01:42:54,498
Oh, hell,
I couldn't make this team.

1825
01:42:59,470 --> 01:43:01,572
I'm gonna go walk
the first corner.

1826
01:43:03,308 --> 01:43:04,943
I figured.

1827
01:43:15,619 --> 01:43:16,955
Counting on it.

1828
01:43:51,823 --> 01:43:53,024
Ken.

1829
01:43:53,124 --> 01:43:54,625
Chaz.

1830
01:43:59,931 --> 01:44:01,309
We'll change
the color of them seats,

1831
01:44:01,333 --> 01:44:02,333
shall we, Frost?

1832
01:44:08,472 --> 01:44:10,875
Well, if this were
a beauty pageant...

1833
01:44:11,276 --> 01:44:12,844
we just lost.

1834
01:44:13,745 --> 01:44:14,779
Looks fast, don't it?

1835
01:44:14,879 --> 01:44:17,614
Ah, looks aren't everything.

1836
01:44:21,585 --> 01:44:24,722
Scarfiotti and Bandini
start for Ferrari.

1837
01:44:30,362 --> 01:44:31,528
You can take him.

1838
01:44:31,628 --> 01:44:33,798
Four minutes, Ken.
Four minutes, buddy.

1839
01:44:33,898 --> 01:44:35,343
<i>Live from Le Mans, France.</i>

1840
01:44:35,367 --> 01:44:37,435
Mom! Come on.

1841
01:44:37,534 --> 01:44:39,771
All right, coming.

1842
01:44:39,871 --> 01:44:42,474
<i>The 24 Hours of Le Mans.</i>

1843
01:44:42,573 --> 01:44:44,209
<i>And there are the cars
lined up...</i>

1844
01:44:47,045 --> 01:44:49,280
<i>Drivers,
please take your places.</i>

1845
01:45:08,033 --> 01:45:09,276
- <i>And there they are...</i>
- There he is.

1846
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:10,634
<i>...lined up, ready to go.</i>

1847
01:45:10,735 --> 01:45:12,113
<i>They're lined up
as per their practice times.</i>

1848
01:45:12,137 --> 01:45:13,738
<i>Faster cars
are up to our left.</i>

1849
01:46:04,823 --> 01:46:07,025
Oh, bloody joking!

1850
01:46:12,163 --> 01:46:13,407
<i>Number 10,
a Bizzarrini,</i>

1851
01:46:13,431 --> 01:46:14,799
<i>almost loses control.</i>

1852
01:46:15,300 --> 01:46:16,633
It's all right.

1853
01:46:19,070 --> 01:46:20,939
You looked great
out there, sir.

1854
01:46:21,806 --> 01:46:23,308
What happened to Miles?

1855
01:46:32,050 --> 01:46:33,952
Bloody hell.

1856
01:46:35,453 --> 01:46:36,821
No.

1857
01:46:43,361 --> 01:46:45,296
Poxy bastard.

1858
01:47:20,965 --> 01:47:22,209
<i>After one lap,</i>

1859
01:47:22,233 --> 01:47:25,103
<i>Bandini-Ferrari
is in first place.</i>

1860
01:47:28,705 --> 01:47:30,674
Where is Miles?

1861
01:47:32,610 --> 01:47:33,611
Where the hell is Ken?

1862
01:47:33,710 --> 01:47:34,879
I don't know.

1863
01:47:43,755 --> 01:47:44,756
He's coming in.

1864
01:47:44,856 --> 01:47:45,890
Oi! He's coming in.

1865
01:47:45,990 --> 01:47:47,234
He's coming in.
Let's go.

1866
01:47:47,258 --> 01:47:48,993
Frosty, come on.
Let's go. Move it.

1867
01:47:49,494 --> 01:47:50,962
I think it's his door.

1868
01:47:51,062 --> 01:47:53,422
<i>That's a rough start
for the Ford team so early...</i>

1869
01:47:56,700 --> 01:47:59,837
The bloody door won't close!

1870
01:47:59,938 --> 01:48:02,006
All right. All right.
We'll take care of it.

1871
01:48:02,106 --> 01:48:03,551
Come on, guys.

1872
01:48:03,575 --> 01:48:04,708
Damn door!

1873
01:48:05,143 --> 01:48:06,644
- Try that.
- This'll do it.

1874
01:48:06,744 --> 01:48:08,246
Shelby,
what the hell is wrong?

1875
01:48:08,746 --> 01:48:09,857
Something's hitting
the frame.

1876
01:48:09,881 --> 01:48:12,016
Oh, you're joking, aren't ya?

1877
01:48:12,584 --> 01:48:14,018
Guys, get outta the way.

1878
01:48:14,118 --> 01:48:15,820
Just get outta the way.
Hold it.

1879
01:48:17,021 --> 01:48:19,257
Go! Go, go, go!

1880
01:48:27,198 --> 01:48:28,198
He's back out.

1881
01:48:28,199 --> 01:48:29,234
Go.

1882
01:48:51,789 --> 01:48:53,691
<i>Ken Miles,
in Shelby American's</i>

1883
01:48:53,791 --> 01:48:55,627
<i>Ford number 1, in tenth place.</i>

1884
01:48:55,728 --> 01:48:58,429
<i>Tremendous gains
for Ken Miles in Ford number 1.</i>

1885
01:48:58,529 --> 01:49:00,665
- Come on, Dad. Come on.
- <i>Passing Porsche 43.</i>

1886
01:49:00,765 --> 01:49:03,034
<i>Moving quickly into the
top 20. He's passing them...</i>

1887
01:49:09,507 --> 01:49:12,443
<i>Ken Miles, Ford,
has set a new lap record.</i>

1888
01:49:12,543 --> 01:49:14,312
<i>Three minutes and 34 seconds.</i>

1889
01:49:14,412 --> 01:49:18,049
- Yeah!
<i>- Ken Miles passed it with a time of 3:34.3.</i>

1890
01:49:30,395 --> 01:49:31,562
Shelby.

1891
01:49:31,663 --> 01:49:35,033
He's pushing the car too hard.
That's not the plan.

1892
01:49:35,667 --> 01:49:37,101
Plans change.

1893
01:50:04,195 --> 01:50:07,365
Lap is 3:34.
Track is 8.36.

1894
01:50:07,465 --> 01:50:09,667
Someone tell me
the miles per hour!

1895
01:50:18,943 --> 01:50:20,912
<i>Three minutes, 31.9.</i>

1896
01:50:21,012 --> 01:50:22,222
- Another lap record!
- <i>That's an average speed</i>

1897
01:50:22,246 --> 01:50:25,049
<i>of 142.01 miles per hour.</i>

1898
01:50:27,985 --> 01:50:29,755
Let's go. Let's go, boys.

1899
01:50:29,854 --> 01:50:31,489
Tea's ready, Ken.

1900
01:50:31,589 --> 01:50:32,957
Oh, thank you, Chaz.

1901
01:50:33,458 --> 01:50:36,627
- Happy birthday, old chap!
- Cheers, mate. Great run.

1902
01:50:37,763 --> 01:50:39,163
Go, boys.
Move, move, move.

1903
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:43,401
Need a quick body check!

1904
01:50:45,970 --> 01:50:47,939
You're three seconds faster
than Gurney.

1905
01:50:48,039 --> 01:50:50,017
If you hadn't blown the start,
you'd be in the lead.

1906
01:50:50,041 --> 01:50:51,476
Can you keep this up?

1907
01:50:51,576 --> 01:50:53,344
Can the car?

1908
01:50:55,313 --> 01:50:57,783
<i>There has been
an incident on turn six.</i>

1909
01:50:57,882 --> 01:51:00,551
<i>Number 18 and number 26
have collided.</i>

1910
01:51:25,610 --> 01:51:27,478
<i>It appears
Ferrari number 20,</i>

1911
01:51:27,578 --> 01:51:30,915
<i>Ludovico Scarfiotti,
has also left the track.</i>

1912
01:51:39,924 --> 01:51:41,760
- All right, watch your head.
- Here you go.

1913
01:51:41,860 --> 01:51:42,994
Thank you.

1914
01:51:43,094 --> 01:51:45,096
Have a good dinner, sir.

1915
01:51:45,798 --> 01:51:47,465
Oi, McLaren's pitting.

1916
01:51:51,068 --> 01:51:53,604
Mr. Ford's probably going
somewhere nice for dinner.

1917
01:51:53,704 --> 01:51:55,440
What do you mean "probably"?

1918
01:51:55,540 --> 01:51:56,809
Rain's coming.

1919
01:51:56,909 --> 01:51:58,476
All right.

1920
01:52:13,892 --> 01:52:15,393
Coming in.

1921
01:52:17,962 --> 01:52:19,630
Go, tires up!

1922
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:23,568
Get 'em checked out.

1923
01:52:23,668 --> 01:52:25,369
Engine's running hot, Pops.

1924
01:52:25,470 --> 01:52:27,271
- All right.
- She's hot, mate. Crack on.

1925
01:52:27,371 --> 01:52:29,240
- Go.
- Well done, Denny.

1926
01:52:30,675 --> 01:52:32,076
Tire.

1927
01:52:32,744 --> 01:52:34,011
Dash clear.

1928
01:52:34,746 --> 01:52:35,814
Swap.

1929
01:52:38,716 --> 01:52:40,318
We're at 220. We're okay.

1930
01:52:40,685 --> 01:52:41,787
All right.

1931
01:52:41,887 --> 01:52:43,254
Fuel flying in.

1932
01:52:43,354 --> 01:52:44,957
Rear tires
coming up the wall!

1933
01:52:45,089 --> 01:52:46,266
Get the fuel in there.
Come on. Let's go.

1934
01:52:46,290 --> 01:52:47,525
Swap that out.

1935
01:52:49,660 --> 01:52:50,762
Front set.

1936
01:52:51,195 --> 01:52:52,630
We're good.

1937
01:52:56,300 --> 01:52:58,202
- Get it moving!
- Go! Go!

1938
01:52:58,636 --> 01:53:00,004
Go, go!

1939
01:53:04,141 --> 01:53:05,341
Good job, guys.
Good job.

1940
01:53:05,409 --> 01:53:07,111
It was
a good change, fellas.

1941
01:53:07,211 --> 01:53:08,513
Hey, I need a stopwatch.

1942
01:53:22,995 --> 01:53:29,995
Did you see that? The great American
automobile magnate leaves in a helicopter. Very classy.

1943
01:53:38,676 --> 01:53:40,411
<i>Lorenzo Bandini remains</i>

Easy, Dan.
You're getting boxed in.

1946
01:53:59,630 --> 01:54:01,800
He's not batting
on a full wicket, that one.

1947
01:54:07,605 --> 01:54:09,073
Easy, Dan.

1948
01:54:10,909 --> 01:54:12,276
Oh, bloody hell!

1949
01:54:13,745 --> 01:54:15,513
You arsehole.

1950
01:54:32,163 --> 01:54:33,664
Oh, piss off!

1951
01:54:36,935 --> 01:54:38,636
You wanker!

1952
01:54:44,810 --> 01:54:48,981
A face like a smacked arse,
now, don't ya?

Go, Ken. Come on, Ken.

1956
01:55:17,341 --> 01:55:19,143
Nice stopwatch.

1957
01:55:19,610 --> 01:55:21,679
You want one? They're Italian.

01:55:54,712 --> 01:55:56,289

01:56:01,719 --> 01:56:02,821
Yes, sir?

1967
01:56:04,122 --> 01:56:05,389
Yes, sir.

1968
01:56:05,690 --> 01:56:06,892
Yes, sir.

1969
01:56:07,926 --> 01:56:09,795
Okay, sir.
Right away, sir.

1970
01:56:16,168 --> 01:56:17,401
Hey!

1971
01:56:18,469 --> 01:56:20,671
What the hell are you doing?
Give me that.

1972
01:56:23,175 --> 01:56:24,408
Dumbass.

1973
01:56:24,776 --> 01:56:25,944
Mr. Shelby...

01:57:08,120 --> 01:57:09,286
Here we go.

1975
01:57:13,091 --> 01:57:14,091
Come on, girl.

1976
01:57:14,159 --> 01:57:15,559
Come on.

1977
01:57:21,499 --> 01:57:23,267
Hold it together now.

1978
01:57:37,849 --> 01:57:39,050
God!

1979
01:57:41,019 --> 01:57:42,553
Bugger! Come on.

1982
01:57:47,558 --> 01:57:50,262
His brakes are shot.
All right, here we go.

1983
01:57:50,361 --> 01:57:53,397
<i>It looks like Ken Miles is
bringing the number 1 Ford.</i>

1984
01:57:53,497 --> 01:57:54,942

1985
01:57:54,966 --> 01:57:57,701
Coming in.
Watch yourself, guys.

1986
01:57:58,402 --> 01:58:00,739
- Brakes. Nothing. Gone.
- Yeah.

1987
01:58:00,839 --> 01:58:03,541
All right. Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

1988
01:58:05,043 --> 01:58:08,046
I had him. I almost had him.

1989
01:58:09,380 --> 01:58:11,682
Well, he's putting
another lap on us now.

1990
01:58:11,783 --> 01:58:14,618
All right. Fit it in.
Do the upper arm first.

1991
01:58:14,718 --> 01:58:16,731
Come on, let's go.
Come in now, now. Faster.

1992
01:58:16,755 --> 01:58:17,755
Let's go.

1993
01:58:17,823 --> 01:58:19,090
Upper arm first.

1994
01:58:19,690 --> 01:58:21,325
Watch the brake line
pulling it out.

1995
01:58:21,425 --> 01:58:23,427
They're doing it. The brakes.

1996
01:58:23,527 --> 01:58:24,739
<i>Now, that's gonna take...</i>

1997
01:58:24,763 --> 01:58:26,363
I said
watch the brake line.

1998
01:58:26,463 --> 01:58:28,266
Faster!
Faster! Faster!

1999
01:58:28,365 --> 01:58:29,509
Coming in.
Watch your back!

2000
01:58:29,533 --> 01:58:30,912
Jeff,
you've gotta be faster!

2001
01:58:44,582 --> 01:58:45,822
Bleed the brakes, Jeff.

2002
01:58:45,884 --> 01:58:46,884
No, no, no.

2003
01:58:47,185 --> 01:58:49,855
It's against the rules.
You cannot just change things.

2004
01:58:49,955 --> 01:58:50,955
Oh, no, no, no.

2005
01:58:51,022 --> 01:58:53,124
You show me where it says
in your book

2006
01:58:53,225 --> 01:58:55,026
that we cannot swap out
the system,

2007
01:58:55,126 --> 01:58:56,204
and then
you can disqualify us.

2008
01:58:56,228 --> 01:58:57,228
Bulldog, back off.

2009
01:58:57,295 --> 01:58:59,231
Calm down. Calm down.

2010
01:58:59,331 --> 01:59:00,664
This is not legal.

2011
01:59:00,765 --> 01:59:02,475
You show me where it says
in that little rule book

2012
01:59:02,499 --> 01:59:04,803
where I can't swap out
my upright assembly.

2013
01:59:04,903 --> 01:59:06,071
A part is a part.

2014
01:59:06,171 --> 01:59:07,949
Be it a brake caliper, a rotor,
or an upright assembly,

2015
01:59:07,973 --> 01:59:10,008
and I can swap out
any damn thing I want to.

2016
01:59:11,042 --> 01:59:12,710
We read your damn rule book.

2017
01:59:18,515 --> 01:59:20,684
Bandini's pitting.
He's pitting.

2018
01:59:27,625 --> 01:59:29,560
Oh, what a shame.

2019
01:59:29,660 --> 01:59:30,829
I think he blew a line.

2020
01:59:30,929 --> 01:59:32,489
Well, he was trying
to keep up with you.

2021
01:59:42,539 --> 01:59:44,776
I don't speak Italian,
but he ain't happy.

2022
01:59:56,187 --> 01:59:57,789
Get me out of here, Pops.

2023
01:59:57,889 --> 01:59:59,090
- Come on!
- All right.

2024
01:59:59,190 --> 02:00:00,424
Come on!

2025
02:00:00,524 --> 02:00:02,193
Almost there, Ken.
Almost there.

2026
02:00:02,559 --> 02:00:03,560
How's it looking, buddy?

2027
02:00:03,661 --> 02:00:04,930
One pump, and we're good.

2028
02:00:05,397 --> 02:00:06,530
Car's yours, Ken.

2029
02:00:06,630 --> 02:00:07,875
All right, listen,
you can still take him,

2030
02:00:07,899 --> 02:00:09,134
but you gotta pass him twice.

2031
02:00:09,234 --> 02:00:11,468
I get it. Pass him twice.

2032
02:00:18,276 --> 02:00:19,677
Ford number 1
driven by Ken Miles

2033
02:00:19,778 --> 02:00:23,447
<i>is back out, hot on the heels
of Bandini in Ferrari 21.</i>

2034
02:01:21,940 --> 02:01:25,176
Not bloody good enough,
Miles! Come on!

2035
02:01:25,509 --> 02:01:27,012
He's off his pace.

2036
02:01:28,645 --> 02:01:30,547
He doesn't trust the car yet.

2037
02:01:30,982 --> 02:01:33,885
Come on, Ken.
I gave you new brakes, buddy.

2038
02:01:40,125 --> 02:01:41,525
All right.

2039
02:01:42,526 --> 02:01:44,695
What did you come here for?

2040
02:01:46,530 --> 02:01:47,932
Let's do it.

2041
02:02:12,357 --> 02:02:14,225
That's it! Come on!

2042
02:02:25,370 --> 02:02:26,771
He ain't done it yet.

2043
02:02:30,442 --> 02:02:32,643
He needs to take
another lap on him.

2044
02:02:56,301 --> 02:02:57,802
He needs to pit soon.

2045
02:02:57,902 --> 02:03:00,604
He needs to catch
Bandini first.

2046
02:03:10,515 --> 02:03:12,183
All right, you bastard.

2047
02:03:13,351 --> 02:03:14,819
Let's do this again.

2048
02:03:44,449 --> 02:03:45,850
Come on, now.

2049
02:03:46,384 --> 02:03:48,353
That's my girl!
That's my girl!

2050
02:04:08,506 --> 02:04:11,209
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

2051
02:04:11,643 --> 02:04:12,844
Bloody hell!

2052
02:04:26,958 --> 02:04:29,494
He did it. We're in the lead.

2053
02:04:29,594 --> 02:04:30,895
Are we in the lead?

2054
02:04:30,995 --> 02:04:32,931
What about Bandini?

2055
02:04:33,364 --> 02:04:34,799
Where's Bandini?

2056
02:04:35,400 --> 02:04:37,202
They're done. Finished.

2057
02:04:37,669 --> 02:04:38,937
Ferrari's over.

2058
02:04:39,037 --> 02:04:41,039
McLaren's four minutes
behind him in a GT.

2059
02:04:41,139 --> 02:04:44,776
So we're lying Ken first,
and two and three. All Fords.

2060
02:05:00,291 --> 02:05:01,969
<i>Ferrari number 21</i>

2061
02:05:01,993 --> 02:05:04,395
<i>and driver Bandini
have left the track.</i>

2062
02:05:06,698 --> 02:05:08,166
The Deuce is coming.

2063
02:05:17,208 --> 02:05:20,345
Ken's up in a half an hour.
Want me to wake him?

2064
02:05:20,445 --> 02:05:21,846
Nah, let him sleep.

2065
02:05:22,880 --> 02:05:24,725
- Thank you very much. Thank you.
- Unbelievable.

2066
02:05:24,749 --> 02:05:25,989
- Hello.
- Mr. Ford.

2067
02:05:26,084 --> 02:05:27,161
We're not
quite there yet, but...

2068
02:05:27,185 --> 02:05:28,620
You missed a good meal.

2069
02:05:28,720 --> 02:05:30,421
There he is. There he is.

2070
02:05:32,323 --> 02:05:33,558
Brief me, Leo.

2071
02:05:34,225 --> 02:05:36,494
We're running
one, two, three, Mr. Ford.

2072
02:05:37,629 --> 02:05:38,561
Who's in the lead?

2073
02:05:38,563 --> 02:05:40,431
Hulme, Miles.

2074
02:05:42,700 --> 02:05:44,435
You know, I was thinking,
Mr. Ford...

2075
02:05:45,270 --> 02:05:48,840
wouldn't it be great
if all three Fords lined up

2076
02:05:48,940 --> 02:05:51,109
and crossed the finish line
at the exact same time?

2077
02:05:51,744 --> 02:05:53,746
They all lined up
and came home together.

2078
02:05:53,845 --> 02:05:55,947
Ford. Ford. Ford.

2079
02:05:56,514 --> 02:05:59,050
I don't think we can
actually do that, sir, but...

2080
02:06:00,285 --> 02:06:01,519
Why not?

2081
02:06:02,520 --> 02:06:04,689
Miles is laps ahead, Leo.

2082
02:06:04,789 --> 02:06:07,492
What would you have him do,
slow down?

2083
02:06:08,793 --> 02:06:10,128
Yeah.

2084
02:06:17,001 --> 02:06:19,304
Mr. Ford wants Miles
to slow down.

2085
02:06:19,404 --> 02:06:21,806
He wants all three cars to
cross at the exact same time.

2086
02:06:21,906 --> 02:06:23,808
He thinks it'll be
a historic moment for Ford.

2087
02:06:23,908 --> 02:06:25,843
It'll make a great photograph.

2088
02:06:27,145 --> 02:06:29,748
Shelby, Miles needs to be
a team player here,

2089
02:06:29,847 --> 02:06:31,182
and so do you.

2090
02:06:31,282 --> 02:06:33,217
You gonna tell him,
or you need me to?

2091
02:06:34,787 --> 02:06:37,322
Don't go near my driver.
Go on.

2092
02:06:38,156 --> 02:06:39,590
This is what Mr. Ford wants.

2093
02:06:39,691 --> 02:06:40,892
Go on now.

2094
02:06:41,326 --> 02:06:43,194
- He expects loyalty.
- Go on.

2095
02:06:59,844 --> 02:07:02,456
- Guys, let's go. Come on.
- All right, look lively, boys.

2096
02:07:02,480 --> 02:07:03,648
Let's go. Frosty.

2097
02:07:03,749 --> 02:07:05,249
Yeah, coming.

2098
02:07:06,117 --> 02:07:07,585
Let's go. Come on.

2099
02:07:07,685 --> 02:07:09,220
What's Beebe want?

2100
02:07:13,558 --> 02:07:14,926
Oh.

2101
02:07:15,026 --> 02:07:17,061
It's off the scale, innit?

2102
02:07:22,233 --> 02:07:24,135
They want you to slow down.

2103
02:07:28,139 --> 02:07:29,674
Run that by me again.

2104
02:07:30,208 --> 02:07:31,909
They want you to slow down.

2105
02:07:34,412 --> 02:07:36,013
You're outshining
their car, Ken.

2106
02:07:36,114 --> 02:07:37,850
You're four minutes up
on McLaren.

2107
02:07:37,949 --> 02:07:39,350
The Deuce wants
the three Fords

2108
02:07:39,450 --> 02:07:42,120
to cross the finish line
one, two, three, all together.

2109
02:07:47,425 --> 02:07:49,660
They're asking that
you be a team player...

2110
02:07:51,195 --> 02:07:52,765
and make that photograph
happen for 'em.

2111
02:07:52,865 --> 02:07:56,334
That photograph.
That's good.

2112
02:07:56,835 --> 02:07:59,437
That is good. Mmm.

2113
02:08:01,406 --> 02:08:03,374
Ken, even if
you tie for first...

2114
02:08:04,242 --> 02:08:06,177
you'd still be the first man
ever to win...

2115
02:08:06,677 --> 02:08:09,480
Sebring, Daytona, and Le Mans
in the same year.

2116
02:08:10,081 --> 02:08:11,582
You'd have the triple crown.

2117
02:08:18,956 --> 02:08:20,391
Look, I ain't get...

2118
02:08:21,659 --> 02:08:23,570
I haven't been able to get you
to follow an order

2119
02:08:23,594 --> 02:08:24,996
since day one.

2120
02:08:25,096 --> 02:08:27,165
Whatever you wanna do
is fine with me.

2121
02:08:28,801 --> 02:08:30,368
My choice?

2122
02:08:31,737 --> 02:08:33,104
Your choice.

2123
02:08:39,544 --> 02:08:41,546
The engine's
running at boiling.

2124
02:08:41,646 --> 02:08:43,114
The brakes are shot.

2125
02:08:45,983 --> 02:08:47,418
How was that?

2126
02:08:48,986 --> 02:08:50,021
Taken care of.

2127
02:08:50,321 --> 02:08:51,956
The car's yours, Ken.

2128
02:08:52,056 --> 02:08:53,524
Ken, the car's yours.

2129
02:08:54,625 --> 02:08:55,626
Ken!

2130
02:08:55,727 --> 02:08:57,361
Car's yours, Ken.

2131
02:09:30,294 --> 02:09:32,272
<i>It's the Fords
that are the cars to beat,</i>

2132
02:09:32,296 --> 02:09:33,899
<i>claiming the top three
positions...</i>

2133
02:09:33,998 --> 02:09:35,166
What the hell is he doing?

2134
02:09:35,266 --> 02:09:36,744
<i>...led by Ken Miles
in Ford number 1...</i>

2135
02:09:37,970 --> 02:09:39,103
<i>If you're not</i>

2136
02:09:39,203 --> 02:09:40,304
<i>watching this right now...</i>

2137
02:09:40,404 --> 02:09:41,606
Don't answer that.

2138
02:09:41,706 --> 02:09:42,975
Get away from it.

2139
02:09:43,074 --> 02:09:44,509
Get away from it.

2140
02:09:44,609 --> 02:09:47,211
<i>Ken Miles in Ford
number 1 is demonstrating</i>

2141
02:09:47,311 --> 02:09:50,314
<i>why he's one of the top drivers
here at Le Mans</i>

2142
02:09:50,414 --> 02:09:52,951
<i>with an outstanding display
of skill.</i>

2143
02:09:53,050 --> 02:09:55,019
<i>Keep an eye on Ford number 1.</i>

2144
02:10:11,837 --> 02:10:13,404
He's gonna break
his own record.

2145
02:10:13,504 --> 02:10:14,740
Shut up.

2146
02:10:23,548 --> 02:10:24,582
Wait for it.

2147
02:10:26,617 --> 02:10:27,786
Wait for it.

2148
02:10:31,322 --> 02:10:32,322
Now.

2149
02:10:35,326 --> 02:10:37,796
Miles. Miles. Miles.

2150
02:10:37,896 --> 02:10:40,164
Miles. Miles. Miles.

2151
02:10:40,264 --> 02:10:42,433
Miles. Miles. Miles.

2152
02:11:18,003 --> 02:11:20,839
3:30.6.
That's another record.

2153
02:11:24,943 --> 02:11:27,111
<i>Another lap record
falls to Ken Miles...</i>

2154
02:11:27,211 --> 02:11:28,579
It's a perfect lap.

2155
02:11:28,679 --> 02:11:30,557
<i>...breaking his own record
and virtually guaranteeing</i>

2156
02:11:30,581 --> 02:11:32,951
<i>first place
for Shelby American</i>

2157
02:11:33,051 --> 02:11:34,485
<i>and their exciting GT40.</i>

2158
02:11:34,585 --> 02:11:36,487
<i>Ken Miles
in Shelby America's</i>

2159
02:11:36,587 --> 02:11:40,092
<i>Ford number 1

2160
02:11:40,191 --> 02:11:42,060
<i>Three minutes
and 30.6 seconds...</i>

2161
02:11:42,159 --> 02:11:43,160
Bring him in.

2162
02:11:43,260 --> 02:11:45,030
Right now!
He's outta control.

2163
02:11:45,396 --> 02:11:47,632
Now, you bring him in
before he wrecks that car

2164
02:11:47,733 --> 02:11:48,867
and we don't finish.

2165
02:11:51,069 --> 02:11:52,403
Bring him in, Shelby,

2166
02:11:52,503 --> 02:11:55,406
or I will get you banned
from the SCCA and the FIA.

2167
02:11:57,075 --> 02:11:58,910
Ken Miles is behind
the wheel, Leo.

2168
02:11:59,310 --> 02:12:01,212
That's his car to the finish.

2169
02:12:02,748 --> 02:12:04,783
<i>H-A-P-P-Y</i>

2170
02:12:04,883 --> 02:12:06,985
<i>I'm H-A-P-P-Y</i>

2171
02:12:07,085 --> 02:12:09,755
<i>I know I am, I'm sure I am</i>

2172
02:12:10,521 --> 02:12:11,890
Woo!

2173
02:12:12,758 --> 02:12:13,859
Oh.

2174
02:13:36,208 --> 02:13:37,976
Come on, lads, where are ya?

2175
02:13:48,619 --> 02:13:49,897
<i>That is quite a sight to see.</i>

2176
02:13:49,921 --> 02:13:50,989
What's he doing?

2177
02:13:51,589 --> 02:13:52,958
Mum, why is he slowing down?

2178
02:13:53,058 --> 02:13:55,326
<i>...the second and third place
Fords to close ranks.</i>

2179
02:14:25,190 --> 02:14:27,926
The three Fords are going
to cross the line together.

2180
02:14:28,026 --> 02:14:30,061
Ken Miles slowed down.
He waited for them.

2181
02:14:30,162 --> 02:14:32,630
<i>- Here are the Fords lined up in a row...</i>
- Dad. No.

2182
02:14:32,731 --> 02:14:33,971
- It's all right.
- Dad.

2183
02:14:34,065 --> 02:14:36,333
It's all right.
Look, he's bringing them in.

2184
02:14:36,433 --> 02:14:38,813
<i>- Led by Ken Miles...</i>
- He's bringing them all in together.

2185
02:14:38,837 --> 02:14:40,704
<i>...certainly
the leader of this group</i>

2186
02:14:40,806 --> 02:14:42,917
- <i>and owner of the Le Mans lap record...</i>
- Good for you.

2187
02:14:42,941 --> 02:14:45,309
- <i>...set just moments ago.</i>
- Good for you, Ken.

2188
02:15:03,295 --> 02:15:05,997
Yeah! Yeah!

2189
02:15:12,469 --> 02:15:14,039
Look at that.

2190
02:15:16,340 --> 02:15:18,009
- Well done, Leo.
- You too, Don.

2191
02:15:35,227 --> 02:15:36,393
<i>Please stand by.</i>

2192
02:15:36,493 --> 02:15:37,996
<i>Final results
are under review.</i>

2193
02:15:38,096 --> 02:15:40,265
...is explain to me
how he's finished first

2194
02:15:40,364 --> 02:15:41,665
and he's not won the race?

2195
02:15:41,766 --> 02:15:43,969
Because McLaren
started from further,

2196
02:15:44,069 --> 02:15:45,402
so he came in...
he won.

2197
02:15:45,502 --> 02:15:46,537
Look, it's not a tie.

2198
02:15:46,637 --> 02:15:47,705
No, because McLaren...

2199
02:15:47,806 --> 02:15:49,217
Because McLaren started
further back,

2200
02:15:49,241 --> 02:15:51,118
he's saying he's traveled
that little bit further,

2201
02:15:51,142 --> 02:15:52,443
so he's won and not Ken.

2202
02:15:52,543 --> 02:15:54,411
That is bullshit.
That's bullshit.

2203
02:15:54,511 --> 02:15:56,614
Shel! Hold on!

2204
02:16:10,427 --> 02:16:12,206
- Where's the tie?
- Hey, hey, hey.

2205
02:16:12,230 --> 02:16:13,331
Where's the goddamn tie?

2206
02:16:13,430 --> 02:16:14,498
What?

2207
02:16:14,598 --> 02:16:15,877
- You son of a bitch!
- Hey, Shelby!

2208
02:16:15,901 --> 02:16:17,369
- You knew!
- No, I didn't know!

2209
02:16:17,468 --> 02:16:19,703
- That's enough! Enough!
- Get off me! Hey!

2210
02:16:20,205 --> 02:16:21,639
Bruce.

2211
02:16:21,740 --> 02:16:23,742
Nice race, mate. Congrats.

2212
02:16:45,462 --> 02:16:46,932
Shel!

2213
02:16:51,336 --> 02:16:52,670
They robbed you, Ken.

2214
02:16:52,771 --> 02:16:54,538
<i>Here is the clarification.</i>

2215
02:16:54,638 --> 02:16:57,008
<i>Though the drivers finished
the race in a heat,</i>

2216
02:16:57,108 --> 02:16:59,411
<i>McLaren has been ruled
the winner</i>

2217
02:16:59,510 --> 02:17:00,750
<i>as he started
from farther back.</i>

2218
02:17:00,812 --> 02:17:02,380
Some bullshit
technicality.

2219
02:17:02,479 --> 02:17:06,483
<i>Final results. Ford number 2,
driven by McLaren and Amon,</i>

2220
02:17:06,583 --> 02:17:07,919
<i>is the winner.</i>

2221
02:17:08,019 --> 02:17:10,587
<i>Ford number 1, driven
by Miles and Hulme,</i>

2222
02:17:10,688 --> 02:17:11,923
<i>second place.</i>

2223
02:17:12,023 --> 02:17:14,625
<i>In third place,
Bucknum and Hutcherson</i>

2224
02:17:14,726 --> 02:17:16,294
<i>in Ford number 5.</i>

2225
02:17:16,394 --> 02:17:17,829
I never should've asked you.

2226
02:17:24,102 --> 02:17:25,770
Selling cars, huh?

2227
02:17:28,440 --> 02:17:29,941
That's what they do.

2228
02:17:30,875 --> 02:17:34,145
Well, you promised me
the drive.

2229
02:17:37,048 --> 02:17:38,183
Not the win.

2230
02:17:39,384 --> 02:17:40,952
It was a hell of a drive.

2231
02:17:41,853 --> 02:17:43,687
She's a hell of a machine.

2232
02:17:44,289 --> 02:17:45,824
Oh, she's fast.

2233
02:17:47,459 --> 02:17:48,994
Could be faster.

2234
02:17:50,729 --> 02:17:52,263
The 7 liter's sweet...

2235
02:17:52,964 --> 02:17:54,165
but, uh...

2236
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:56,801
we still need
a lighter chassis.

2237
02:17:56,901 --> 02:18:00,671
I was thinking
bonded aluminium.

2238
02:18:00,772 --> 02:18:03,842
It's a ground-up rebuild,
but if it works...

2239
02:18:04,409 --> 02:18:06,510
we can lose
a couple hundred pounds.

2240
02:18:06,610 --> 02:18:08,612
Well, what the hell
are we doing here?

2241
02:18:09,948 --> 02:18:12,150
Let me take a shower,
get a cup of tea...

2242
02:18:12,683 --> 02:18:14,352
ham and cheese cob
or something.

2243
02:18:15,086 --> 02:18:17,155
We're gonna get
the bastards next year.

2244
02:18:40,945 --> 02:18:43,680
Got a bit of fuel left
in the tank.

2245
02:18:44,715 --> 02:18:46,583
What do you think
of those honeycomb panels?

2246
02:18:46,683 --> 02:18:48,353
What you were looking for?

2247
02:18:48,685 --> 02:18:50,055
Don't know yet.

2248
02:19:15,612 --> 02:19:17,348
She looks pretty good.

2249
02:19:27,559 --> 02:19:31,229
<i>There's a point
at 7,000 RPM...</i>

2250
02:19:32,497 --> 02:19:34,732
<i>where everything fades.</i>

2251
02:19:37,001 --> 02:19:39,636
<i>The machine becomes
weightless.</i>

2252
02:19:40,505 --> 02:19:41,840
<i>Just disappears.</i>

2253
02:19:42,540 --> 02:19:43,575
Yeah!

2254
02:19:43,674 --> 02:19:44,754
<i>And all that's left</i>

2255
02:19:44,809 --> 02:19:45,844
<i>is a body...</i>

2256
02:19:45,944 --> 02:19:47,946
<i>moving through space and time.</i>

2257
02:19:51,382 --> 02:19:53,650
<i>7,000 RPM.</i>

2258
02:19:54,552 --> 02:19:55,987
<i>That's where you meet it.</i>

2259
02:19:57,989 --> 02:19:59,690
<i>You feel it coming.</i>

2260
02:19:59,791 --> 02:20:02,060
<i>It creeps up on you,
close in your ear.</i>

2261
02:20:10,401 --> 02:20:12,003
<i>Asks you a question.</i>

2262
02:20:13,004 --> 02:20:14,973
<i>The only question
that matters.</i>

2263
02:20:20,778 --> 02:20:22,080
Get the van!

2264
02:20:23,414 --> 02:20:24,949
<i>"Who are you?"</i>

2265
02:20:58,516 --> 02:20:59,651
What do you think?

2266
02:20:59,751 --> 02:21:02,220
It's fantastic.
Feels really good.

2267
02:21:02,820 --> 02:21:04,222
Nice and smooth.

2268
02:21:05,089 --> 02:21:07,058
No vibration in the box.
Feels really strong.

2269
02:21:07,158 --> 02:21:09,360
You drove it
for less than an hour.

2270
02:21:09,794 --> 02:21:11,729
You can't tell shit
after an hour.

2271
02:21:11,829 --> 02:21:15,300
Go for seven even,
that'd be 14 all in.

2272
02:21:15,400 --> 02:21:16,734
Hey, Shel.

2273
02:21:26,377 --> 02:21:29,614
Hey, Shel, that guy,
you know the one in the hat,

2274
02:21:29,713 --> 02:21:32,350
he's ready to close
on those two 427s.

2275
02:21:32,450 --> 02:21:34,919
His and hers. Full freight.

2276
02:21:35,687 --> 02:21:38,256
They, uh, flew in
from Galveston.

2277
02:21:38,356 --> 02:21:39,723
Uh-huh.

2278
02:21:40,858 --> 02:21:44,996
Uh, I need you to come outside
for maybe a minute.

2279
02:21:45,730 --> 02:21:47,098
And do what?

2280
02:21:48,733 --> 02:21:50,201
Be Carroll Shelby.

2281
02:21:51,169 --> 02:21:53,738
Tell them a story,
spin a few magic words.

2282
02:21:54,639 --> 02:21:57,375
What does that mean?
"Magic words"?

2283
02:21:58,576 --> 02:21:59,677
It means...

2284
02:22:00,111 --> 02:22:02,113
come outside and say hello

2285
02:22:02,213 --> 02:22:04,515
and make them feel good
about their purchase.

2286
02:22:04,616 --> 02:22:05,817
They're getting the damn cars.

2287
02:22:05,917 --> 02:22:07,685
That's what they get
for their money, Phil.

2288
02:22:07,785 --> 02:22:09,029
Now, either they want 'em
or they don't.

2289
02:22:09,053 --> 02:22:11,122
- Am I some kind of a lounge act?
- No.

2290
02:22:11,222 --> 02:22:12,857
Am I here to talk people
into things?

2291
02:22:24,202 --> 02:22:26,237
It's been six months, Shel.

2292
02:22:27,572 --> 02:22:29,507
Six months.

2293
02:22:33,511 --> 02:22:36,114
Sometimes they don't
get out of the car.

2294
02:23:11,482 --> 02:23:12,884
Peter!

2295
02:23:13,752 --> 02:23:16,354
Peter, come and take
the garbage out.

2296
02:23:16,454 --> 02:23:17,889
Mr. Shelby.

2297
02:23:19,390 --> 02:23:20,825
Oh, hello, Pete.

2298
02:23:22,728 --> 02:23:24,329
I remember that wrench.

2299
02:23:25,530 --> 02:23:27,265
My dad threw it at you.

2300
02:23:28,599 --> 02:23:29,934
I believe he did.

2301
02:23:30,736 --> 02:23:32,103
Why?

2302
02:23:34,706 --> 02:23:36,040
Oh.

2303
02:23:36,874 --> 02:23:39,210
I think I probably said
something to him.

2304
02:23:39,977 --> 02:23:41,512
Called him a few names.

2305
02:23:43,681 --> 02:23:45,149
That's right.

2306
02:23:53,826 --> 02:23:55,393
Do you wanna speak to my mum?

2307
02:23:56,127 --> 02:23:58,296
Well, I did. Uh...

2308
02:23:58,963 --> 02:24:01,165
I came to say hello,
check in on her and...

2309
02:24:05,870 --> 02:24:08,005
Then I started thinking
that sometimes...

2310
02:24:10,608 --> 02:24:12,745
uh, words...

2311
02:24:13,277 --> 02:24:17,382
just... ar-are not useful.

2312
02:24:23,187 --> 02:24:25,590
Tools are useful 'cause
you can make stuff with 'em

2313
02:24:25,690 --> 02:24:27,492
and you can fix stuff
with 'em.

2314
02:24:28,861 --> 02:24:30,461
Here.

2315
02:24:31,362 --> 02:24:32,497
Thanks.

2316
02:24:41,139 --> 02:24:42,940
Your daddy was, uh...

2317
02:24:46,177 --> 02:24:48,212
He was your friend.

2318
02:24:54,018 --> 02:24:55,386
Yes, he was.

2319
02:24:56,755 --> 02:24:58,423
Yes, sir.

2320
02:25:03,161 --> 02:25:05,696
And he thought you was
just finer than frog fur.

2321
02:25:10,869 --> 02:25:12,503
Peter!

2322
02:25:17,175 --> 02:25:19,377
I think I've gotta go
help my mum.

2323
02:25:21,446 --> 02:25:24,148
What are you doing here then?
Go on.

2324
02:25:24,949 --> 02:25:26,451
Bye.

2325
02:27:09,220 --> 02:27:14,220

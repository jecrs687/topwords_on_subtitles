Thank you, Captain Benson.

I know the last thing
many cops wanna do

186
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,963
is talk about feelings or fears.

187
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:09,619

188

but the department policies
have changed, thank God,

189
00:09:13,808 --> 00:09:17,752

no longer a sign of weakness.

206

In this capacity, yes.

But the department is more
concerned that people get help,

214
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:11,488
rather than worrying
about their records.

215
00:10:11,537 --> 00:10:14,105
Yeah, but NYPD can still
take my weapon away.

00:10:14,154 --> 00:10:16,090
Well, if it's warranted, yeah.

So why would anybody
ever tell you anything?

The thing that gets me

220

It was like...

222
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,746
it was like I had the life
that she should've had.

223
00:10:31,795 --> 00:10:33,547
I'd take that with a grain of salt.

but being a woman of color?

226
00:10:38,066 --> 00:10:40,269
Yeah, I get that, but it was
probably more than one thing

227
00:10:40,318 --> 00:10:41,591
that pushed her over the edge.

228
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,800
It just bothers me
because a few years ago,

229

said let's get a cup of coffee.

You heard his final words.

541
00:23:52,113 --> 00:23:53,363
Olivia, when you told me

542
00:23:53,412 --> 00:23:55,059
you needed to see me right away,

543
00:23:55,108 --> 00:23:56,995
I thought it was because
you needed help.

544
00:23:57,055 --> 00:23:58,105
I do need help.

545
00:23:58,153 --> 00:24:00,775
You have information
that is relevant to our case.

546
00:24:00,824 --> 00:24:03,698
We have spent a lot
of time establishing trust.

547
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,387
If you wanna question me for a case,

548
00:24:05,436 --> 00:24:06,888
you can't come here under a pretext.

549
00:24:06,936 --> 00:24:08,026

550
00:24:08,075 --> 00:24:11,323
but if Ralph revealed anything
to you that could help us...

551
00:24:11,372 --> 00:24:13,193
I cannot reveal it to you.

552
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,805

my patient's privacy.

if you can't see a way to help us,

557

564

Your Honor, we believe that
Dr. Lindstrom has evidence

565
00:24:54,696 --> 00:24:57,229
that is crucial to an ongoing
SVU investigation.

566
00:24:57,278 --> 00:24:59,438
Now, it's evidence
we can't get any other way

567
00:24:59,487 --> 00:25:00,908
because the complaining witness,

568
00:25:00,956 --> 00:25:02,908
and another key witness,
Dr. Lindstrom's patient,

569
00:25:02,956 --> 00:25:04,081
are both deceased.

570
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,205
Dr. Lindstrom,

571
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:08,078
without asking you
to reveal anything specific,

572
00:25:08,526 --> 00:25:09,807
can you advise the court

573
00:25:09,856 --> 00:25:12,138
as to whether you might
have information relevant

574
00:25:12,188 --> 00:25:13,980
to this investigation?

575
00:25:14,216 --> 00:25:16,346
I'm not prepared to answer
even that, Your Honor.

576
00:25:16,395 --> 00:25:17,897
There is a precedent here.

577
00:25:17,954 --> 00:25:19,987
We are all profoundly aware

578
00:25:20,161 --> 00:25:21,839
that the NYPD is in the middle

579
00:25:21,888 --> 00:25:23,203
of a mental health crisis,

580
00:25:23,252 --> 00:25:25,212
and it is more important than ever,

581
00:25:25,261 --> 00:25:27,401
that police officers
who have the courage

582
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,073
to seek counseling know,

583
00:25:29,122 --> 00:25:30,436
that their records,

584
00:25:30,485 --> 00:25:33,653
their conversations
remain privileged...

585
00:25:34,406 --> 00:25:35,926
even after their death.

586
00:25:38,349 --> 00:25:39,881
So Carisi's taking Lindstrom to court?

587
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:42,222
Yeah... I wouldn't count on
that working either.

588

Where are we?

589
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:45,454
Well, in 2004,

590
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,374
Rachel made Detective
under Captain Gary Wald

591
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:49,120
and Sergeant Ralph Morris.

592
00:25:49,169 --> 00:25:50,791
She partners up with Detective Guevara.

593
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:52,073
From Tucker's file,

594
00:25:52,122 --> 00:25:55,164
she hooked up with
all three of them plus a UC.

595
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,706
Ralphie?

596
00:25:56,768 --> 00:25:57,875
I don't believe that.

597
00:25:57,924 --> 00:26:00,391
It would explain
Gary's leverage over him.

598
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,134
We were able to trace the burner cell.

599
00:26:03,442 --> 00:26:06,081
Gary and Ralphie exchanged
calls before he killed himself.

600
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:08,128
Okay, so after Rachel's suicide,

601
00:26:08,177 --> 00:26:09,964
Ralphie feels guilt,

602
00:26:10,146 --> 00:26:12,798
Gary leans on him to keep quiet, and...

603
00:26:13,517 --> 00:26:16,687
Ralphie just doesn't see
another way out.

604
00:26:18,258 --> 00:26:20,380
I respect the principle, Your Honor,

605
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:21,511
but in this case,

606
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,364
the two suicides may well
have been the result

607
00:26:23,412 --> 00:26:24,961
of the crime and a cover‐up.

608
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:26,704
And Dr. Lindstrom has a duty to warn.

609
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:29,002
He may have information that
could stop yet another officer

610
00:26:29,051 --> 00:26:30,072
from committing suicide.

611
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:32,782
Mr. Carisi, I've heard you
use phrases like, "maybe,"

612
00:26:32,831 --> 00:26:34,992
"may well have been," "we believe."

613
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:37,276
All words that tell me
this evidence you seek

614
00:26:37,325 --> 00:26:40,432
is speculative and secondhand
and maybe even third‐hand.

615
00:26:40,797 --> 00:26:43,539
You've failed to show
that the interests of justice

616
00:26:43,588 --> 00:26:46,756
outweigh the deceased's
interest in confidentiality.

to take prescription samples
